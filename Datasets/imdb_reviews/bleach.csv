Valhala90,Why not?,7/10,17 September 2018,"Yeah sure, there were things I disliked and casting that I couldn't quite digest (Byakuya and Renji look like home made cosplay, I won't go there), but It was fun watching this movie. I have mixed feelings, but the ""good old Bleach feeling"" is there. It's certainly better than most, if not all, anime/manga live action adaptation, it's not quite on Rurouni Kenshin live action level, but I like it. I also think, when doing live action, that they have to respect certain absolute things in manga/anime storyline, but also change a few things, and that's exactly what this live action adaptation of Bleach did. I also hope there will be sequel since the whole saving Rukia and soul society arc is the best arc in Bleach.

chintok91,It's decent,8/10,17 September 2018,"We all know feature films of animes are trash. Dragon Balls, Full Metal Alchemist, Attack on Titan etc. But this one is decent. I think Japanes just starting to find that grey area between movie and anime. /Blade of Immortal, this one/ I would give this movie about 7 stars, but I gave 8 because, I know there are people who would just give a star only for sake of being picky.

tenshi_ippikiookami,A pleasant surprise,7/10,2 June 2019,"Taking into account how much live action movies based on manga have disappointed me in the past, I came into ""Bleach"" with low expectations (probably not the only one). However, this movie adaptation is funny, with acceptable action set pieces and relatable characters (on top of not stretching its running time endlessly and pointlessly (even if it falls a little bit into this trap in its third act)). And, even if you don't know anything about the manga, it is easy to jump into the story, as the movie does a great job of introducing the world and building it up from scratch. Totally worth watching!

alisonc-1,A Wild Ride,8/10,28 July 2018,"Ichigo (Sota Fukushi) is a high school student who happens to see ghosts and other beings invisible to most humans. When he encounters a Soul Reaper named Rukia (Hana Sugisaki), against his will he helps her to dispatch a Hollow, an evil soul, and by doing so becomes a Soul Reaper himself. He doesn't want the job, but only he can help a now-wounded Rukia recover her own powers and return to her plane of reality. Too bad there are other entities out there that don't appreciate a human taking on a Soul Reaper's job.... This film is based on a very popular manga which I haven't actually read, so I can't say how faithful it is or isn't to the original. I *can* say that the action scenes are accompanied by perfect heavy metal on the soundtrack, the monsters are *really* cool looking and the two leads are adorable. See it for yourself and see if you agree!"
claudiu111,A must see.,9/10,20 July 2018,"A very good adaptation of the first arc of Bleach(well half of it anyway). Just go see this movie when you can.

renardscifi,"Multiple rewatches in, it just keeps getting better.",10/10,27 July 2018,"Go see it. There is a reason people are raving about it as the first decently done adaptation of an anime. It's not perfect, but it is legitimately great and keeps the spirit and feel of the series. Most of the negative reviews of this I've seen so far seem to be coming from people who either don't know the series very well (a hazard with professional reviewers, since they cover so many things), don't understand Japanese cinema (some acting techniques/nuances are different between East and West), or who are just determined to hate it because everything doesn't look 100% identical to the manga (I've seen far worse anime to live-action with far bigger budgets, believe me). This movie condenses the entire half of the first season of the anime (books 1-6), and leaves room for a sequel without leaving hanging threads in the event one never happens.Like many other fans, I was very, VERY skeptical of this movie when it first was announced. I was honestly that person going, ""Oh god, another live action movie of an anime. Can't wait to see how cheesy and bad this ends up.""I'm a convert. You win, Mr. Sato. Take my left kidney and sell it, and whatever else you need to fund the next movie in your trilogy. I've seen it three times now (I live in Japan) and am going again tomorrow. I'm still not bored watching it. It's the sort of movie that fans of the series will keep finding new gems tucked away with each rewatch. If you're not intimately familiar with the manga or anime however, don't sweat it - this is very accessible to newcomers.Characters - 9/10 There are some physical differences (Urahara is older, Masaki's hair isn't red, etc.), but the acting is solid and the character dynamics/relationships are exactly the way they are in the manga. Even if the character looked a bit different, I believed the actors as the characters. Ichigo and Rukia may not have the exact same hair or face as you'd expect, but they absolutely nailed the characters - Ichigo's determination and grit, Rukia's spunky sarcasm, it's all really great.Costumes - 8/10 There was some saving of the budget here for fight scenes - you won't see exact replicas of captain's haoris or the tabi with straw sandals. Rather, the film tries to make things more realistic (i.e. a more natural orange for Ichigo's hair, smaller size hairpins for Orihime, etc.) It looks less like the wacky cosplay of the Rock Musical for Bleach and more like a legit world people actually live in.Music - 10/10 Invokes the anime without copying it, and Alexandros has two kickass songs that make Bleach feel fresh and edgy and hip with a touch of Japan's ancient history and the otherwordliness of the Soul Society.Plot - 9/10 Whenever possible, the film follows the manga almost exactly. For the purposes of sticking 6 manga volumes into one movie, some minor characters (Jinta, Mizuiro, Ururu, etc.) are not introduced, and some events get condensed (i.e. Uryu's hollow bait kicks off the Hexapodus fight that makes Ichigo take being a shinigami seriously, not a Menos Grande). Overall, the story is still very close to the way the manga told it, just condensed.Props - 8/10 Soul Pagers get replaced with something more like a glowing, teardrop shaped stone that looks more otherwordly (let's be honest, when Bleach debuted flip phones were cool, now they're a bit ancient), the zanpakuto are very accurate (yes, even Ichigo's, ignore the reviewers claiming he gets a different sword - the iconic one he's constantly shown with was not the first one he ended up with, and that first sword is what's used here). Rukia's glove and many other things are exactly like the manga.Set - 9/10 Rather than waste the tiny budget this film had in exactly reproducing floorplans and sets (a mere 3.5 million, which is nothing in terms of filmmaking on this level), things are made to feel similar. Ichigo's room is not laid out exactly the same as the manga/anime, but it still has a bed, desk, closet for Rukia to hide in, etc. and feels like Ichigo's room. Same with the Kurosaki household - it feels convincing, if not exactly the same as the manga showed it.Fights: 9.5/10 There are so many good moments here I can't list them all. Is there some visible wire-fu jumping at points? Yes. Does it ruin the action? No, it's no worse than some of the jumps Captain America made in a few films (you know, where they land far too lightly and stiffly to be actually ""falling/landing""?) The Hollows look less cartoonishly simple and more menacing, yet they still have the same mechanics (Cero, claws, medusa-like fur). At one point Ichigo's sword gets stuck in the ground and Renji RUNS UP THE BLADE EDGE and attacks. The swordplay is fantastic.Seriously, give it a chance. There is enough here to please all but the hardcore sticklers (who were never really going to like anything made on less than a Marvel Avengers budget). I was pleasantly surprised, and the movie feels enough like falling in love with the series all over again that I keep going back. I've never dropped $60 and counting on tickets for one movie, especially not an anime adaptation. GO SEE IT!"
ciolo,Well done!,9/10,17 September 2018,"I'm fan of anime series and what I just saw in this Bleach movie didn't disapoint me. I consider it an excellent pilot episode for the amazing sequels to come!

JabbaTheHans,Fun to watch and definitely worth your time,7/10,19 September 2018,"The movie focused on the 1st arc of the anime-- it remained loyal to the story, but changed some things too, so there's something to look forward to. Acting was not that great, but decent. Some plot holes and underutilized characters, but those can be forgiven. However those who haven't watched the anime / read the manga will have difficulty in understanding certain parts of the story because some of the explanations were incomplete (I think the writers assume viewers should have at least watched the anime already before watching the movie). When I first saw the trailer months back, I was worried that the CGI will be disappointing, but I was wrong. CGI was excellent and the hollows were awesome! This is a must watch for anime / manga fans!

softtama,Good adaptation from anime into the live action,7/10,19 September 2018,"This is my first time to write a movie review. Note that I have read/watched all chapters/episodes of Bleach before I watch this movie. Let's be honest, everything in this movie is excellent in terms of live action adaptation! CGI of the special effects are done very well (the Hollows are too!). But of course there's no such thing as perfection out there especially when we are talking about anime live action movie. I can only complain two things here. The portrayal of Byakuya and Renji, I think they could be way much better, especially at their hair style. The last from me, and one of the most important aspects of movie success, is the music. Throughout the entire movie, I don't feel the big hype with the music as much as when I'm watching the anime. I really hope they will bring some aspects from the anime OST to the sequel and that will be a huge yes from me!7.5/10 👏"
billkmc,Finally a manga to live action done right,10/10,14 September 2018,"I have to admit I was taken aback by how good this was, as a massive fan of the manga I was worried they would make a mess of it like many of the other live action adaptations. 
I'll keep it brief as I don't was to add any spoilers. This keeps the feel of the manga and the humour is spot on without getting silly. 
Obviously there are changes in the story but it's done so it doesn't get bogged down and keeps the story flowing. 
The main antagonist is grand fisher with renji and byakuya more in the background driving the story to its conclusion. It also sets up pretty much perfectly for the Ryoka Invasion to be the sequel. 
Ok I appear to had added spoilers but to be fair this isn't anything you wouldn't have gathered from the trailers. 
Overall it looks great it's well acted and the hollows look menacing without them being over done. 
Roll on part two I'm counting down already."
rick-429-633659,90% of this movie is almost Anime perfect,10/10,15 September 2018,"The characters look very similar to how they should look. Ichigo, Chad, Renji and Uryu are almost exactly as I picture them, though Anime tends to draw characters as more of a Japanese/European hybrid look. Byakuya was really close though I felt he needed to look a little more hardened and a few years older.As far as the story, the first half is almost dead on with the Anime, it was really in the last 20 minutes did they change it up a lot ending things a little different. Ichigo's character starts off a little slow but by the end he becomes the hot headed, arrogant, skilled fighter we'd expect. Was really happy to see them go all in on the fights and effects. Was not really expecting to see Sabimaru roar.. though I wish I could have seen a live action bankai. This was probably one of the best anime inspired live action movies I've watched. Would love to see a bigger budget sequel and do the soul society arc and see Ichigo fight all the captains. Also Netflix.. GET THIS AN ENGLISH DUB. It's ridiculous that you have it in like 6 languages but not English. All in all, if you are a fan of the Manga or anime, give this a watch. The costumes, props, character design and feeling of the movie is pretty accurate."
leonthesleepy,"Rest easy. Bleach is one of the best live action anime adaptations by far, with only minor issues.",7/10,20 September 2018,"Bleach (2018) wisely plays with a much smaller, and focused scope than most anime adaptations, and comes out as an enjoyable, and cohesive film that fans can enjoy. Thankfully, the writers did not try to cram every story arc in season 1 into this film like Death Note did, but instead focused on the important stuff like Ichigo and Rukia. The actors all do a fine job, and as long as you dont expect a 1 to 1 recreation, i think fans will be pleased with how much respect it pays to the source material.Now sure, its still extremely cheesy to see some sequences translated to live action. There isnt the iconic BANKAI sequence where you really see the outrageous power of a Reaper, nor do you get amazing action sequences. Plus, the PG 13 rating makes the action sequences surprisingly bloodless and tame by comparison. But what is here is more than serviceable, and its still pretty entertaining for what it is. Most of the humor also lands, and at its core the film has an emotional center along with an arc which it completes.I doubt we will get a sequel since the Soul Society arc would be insanely expensive and effects heavy, but the ending wraps it up pretty neatly so there is at least closure at the end for new fans who just came into the series. It doesn't break new ground, nor is it amazing, but it is a rock solid adaptation of the first season. The best praise i can give the film, is that it made me want to re watch the animated series again. Not because the live action remake was trash, but because it reminded me of why i liked Bleach in the first place."
alextalent,Admirable interpretation of the Anime!,10/10,18 September 2018,"If youve watched the anime then watch this film, it's loyal and doesn't spoil the memory of what was a fantastic series.Yes it has a B movie feel to it, the actors are hit and miss, some of the scenes are totally rubbish or pointless, they spent about £2 on the FX and the action betrays the limited budget by cutting to a weird camera shot to avoid showing what would be an expensive FX shot and then getting the camera in real close so it's hard to see what's going on.And yet I'm completely in love with this movie. It's funny, it avoids too many western tropes which a lot of live action Anime movies do to try and appeal to a wider audience , the acting is mostly good , they've used some of the voice actors from the anime to play the characters which is amazing and works well, the hollows don't suck, the practical effects are next level considering the budget, the story is shortened well , the way they've changed some story elements just in case there isn't a sequel is a good idea as Netflix isn't a reliable producer for sequels, they've managed to plug moments from the anime in without making it clichéd and I genuinely like most of the choices of actors and actresses.So all in all its pretty damn good .There's one huge flaw in this movie which does let it down other than the low budget and that's the bad guys (I won't insult them by attempting to spell their names). Rukias brother is absolutely awful. They've changed his abilities to suit a low budget , but they could have gotten around it by having him do nothing but a simple flash step to take down Ichigo. Instead he doesn't flash step, his fast attacks are fast...but not godly level like in the anime, and I'm not even going to start on his dialogue. The whole thing was a disaster and almost ruined the film. He's like a poor man's bond villan. Why on earth didn't they just keep him ominously silent like in the anime?? You fools!Ideally this film needed to be a TV series with the Stranger things budget, with some awesome FX to really make you feel the evil of the hollows, the power of the soul reapers, better action which flows naturally and the look of a modern series . But that'll never happen . So we can all watch this for what it is - a fantastic and loyal representation of one of the best Animes around.with an awful awful bad guy."
paul_haakonsen,Entertaining movie...,6/10,25 December 2018,"I happened to find the live action movie ""Bleach"" on Netflix. But I am only familiar with the franchise by its name, as I haven't read the anime, nor have I watched any of the animations. So I sat down to watch ""Bleach"" with a blank canvas left open to impressions, so to speak.And not being familiar with the franchise, I have no idea how true the movie is to the animations or anime in general. So I will not even venture there.I found ""Bleach"" to be entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. Sure, it had some shortcomings, but it was an overly entertaining enough movie.The storyline was nice and quite straight forward. It required very little attention from the audience actually to stay up to speed with the movie. Perhaps it was a little bit too simplistic and streamlined. But hey, it made for adequate entertainment, which is why we watch movies after all.I liked the characters - well most of them anyway. I think they had a good ensemble of actors and actresses to portray the individual characters on the screen.The CGI in the movie was actually quite good, and that was something that I was really impressed with. Because for a movie such as this, CGI was a make or break situation. Luckily they opted to throw cash into proper CGI and the result was fantastic. They had some great creature designs and the creatures looked very realistic and actually turned out menacing on the screen.One of the drawbacks of the movie was the music they had in it. It felt somewhat out of place given the presentation and mood of the movie. But music can easily be tuned out, so it wasn't something that dragged the movie down.Has this 2018 live action movie placed a seed in me that urges me to start delving into the anime or animations? No, not really. It was a good movie, good but not fantastic.Personally I don't really understand the title of the movie and franchise; ""Bleach"". It made absolutely no sense to me, and it wasn't explained throughout the course of this 2018 movie."
moelaphako,"A must see for Bleach Fans, & Anime fans in general",10/10,20 August 2018,"Characters look and act great.
The music is good.
Plot is good.
Action is outstanding.Easily the best live action movie I have watched so far.

mayaek,Live Action done right,10/10,14 September 2018,"As a fan of the anime and manga, I was concerned about how they were going to condense the story into a film-length as well as the protrayal and interaction between characters. They took the right amount of creative freedom without losing the heart of the characters or story. In fact, the film wonderfully goes into more depth on certain aspects. Without spoiling, one character's interaction was different but did not break who the character is. That aspect is still growing on me but it's not bad. Overall, this film brought the story back to life and more.

deathcomingtoaschoolnearyou,PLEASE MAKE THE SOUL SOCIETY SEQUEL,10/10,18 September 2018,"This was so gooooooood. I fell in love with Bleach back in 2009. I was thinking that Netflix was going to mess Bleach up like they did with Death Note, but NOPE! It was literally perfect. Warner Bros did an amazing job with all the characters and they made sure that the story stayed true to the anime/manga. Please please please please make a sequel to this. I really wan't to see the Soul Society arch. Make it into a series if you have to. It would be an amazing series with 45 minute to an hour long episodes. Either way I'm really impressed with what they did and I hope they make the sequel.

kristinakoj,Def worth watching,7/10,14 September 2018,"I started the movie expecting yet another garbage live action,but found myself quite supprised. There were some changes that i didnt like compared to the original, but ll in all it wasnt bad. The casting of ichigo was amazing, however the other cast was so so. Also the lack of explanation about the bleach world could be confuaing to people qhove never seen the original. Either way you should give it a try!

shoogeweegen-90169,"Unexpected, in a good way!",8/10,18 September 2018,"For a 'Live-Action' adaption from an anime-series, it was in my opinion a very well made movie contrary to my expectations.Many movie adaptions, be they from games of animes, usually leave me dissapointed. This mainly while they can never really translate the story or feeling behind the original work as well on the big screen. Which made me very dubious about the quality this movie would be when I spotted it on Netflix today. While Bleach (the movie) is not a cinematic master-piece like 'The Shawshank Redemption, or any other Hollywood movie in that regard, it should actually not be compared to those standards. While Bleach is a 'from-anime-to-movie'-adaption, it had me very sceptical at first. Those doubts where quickly expelled a few minutes in, when I really became engrossed and decided to grab a bag of popcorn to watch it with.The story and characters were believable, and the typical japanese over-dramatical acting kept to a minimum. The movie tried to put about a seasons worth of anime into roughly two-hours of movie, and I got to say they did it quite well! Within the time constraints a movie is expected to last, and the budget they had available, I can positively say that this is the best movie-adaption of an anime-series I have seen to date.This may not be the most enjoyable movie for those wanting realism, expecting a cinematic master-piece (or perfect copy/paste of the animes plot), or generally not into asian/anime-themed plots. Everyone else I would definitely recommend giving it a try, and seeing it for yourselves!"
avoiddistraction,10 out of 10 for effort. I'm torn...,8/10,15 September 2018,"The anime is 366 episodes and 4 films long. How do you squeeze it in to 1hr 40 minutes.You don't. You can't. And thankfully they didn't try. But season 1. Almost. Personally I think a film was the wrong move.
A movie intro to a mini series may of been a better approach. That said this was a great effort. The hollows are done well. The CGI is executed well. The characters are believable enough. Until someone dubs it. Please, don't watch anything dubbed... 
Chad isn't a big South American guy which I can't get my head around but blame the anime drawers for me expecting a more mix of ethnicities in this.I watched episodes 1 to 9 of season 1 again when this came on my Netflix and I was like ooh coincidence. And it was pretty much what I just watched. Some dialogue from certain episodes came earlier in the movie and I'm thinking OK so they are skipping that scene in this film... No there's the scene so why not leave dialogue where it was needed and had most impact. 
They honestly jumble things up just to claim they haven't copied their friends homework it seems. And it makes no sense.
There are some nice touches to this some not great but overall a good watch. I just wish they had got a deal to do a TV show after so this could have been polished slightly for an orsm action TV anime adaption. With no fillers like the bountou. Skip.
Hope there is enough love for bleach 2 but then I don't because it would be too much too squeeze in again I'm sure. 
I'm torn."
btbias,"A wonderful adaptation, but they left out or changed too many crucial elements.",6/10,17 September 2018,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Bleach series, so I couldn't help but critique every little thing as I watched. There were a lot of things that this movie did very well: character and set design being the main selling points. Renji and Byakuya both look EXCELLENT, and Chad is just about perfect. It's a shame he didn't get the screen time he needed.And that's where most of my dissatisfaction comes in to play: time. There is so much character development lacking simply because there's not enough time in a single movie to develop everything the way it needs to. For crying out loud, Orihime comes across as a nobody with an unjustifiable crush.. Talk about disappointing.Ichigo himself is, overall, a success. They did a good job portraying his desire to protect people and his overall negative attitude. So in short, his personality was well-done! What I WANTED to see from him, though, was that overwhelming feeling of power. The anime does an excellent job demonstrating the weight of someone's reiatsu (aka spirit pressure), but that concept is practically nonexistent here. Which means all of the fights (though amazingly choreographed with some clever editing to try matching the speed of the anime) lack some of the awe and wonder that sets Shinigami apart from mortals.Oh, and minor spoiler alert for fans of the anime... the scene with the Menos Grande were cut entirely, as was Getsuga Tenshou. Let that sink in for a moment.So why watch this at all? Because most of the story is incredibly accurate - until you get to the last half hour. The fights are pretty epic. And altogether, you can visualize the anime quite clearly as you're watching, giving you a wonderful sense of nostalgia."
nati0336,Wow,10/10,17 September 2018,"I already can't wait for the next one. It was just like watching the show. I loved it. They did an amazing job bring this anime to life.

naijshua-627-972216,Excellent! But I WANT MORE!,10/10,11 November 2018,"I couldn't wait to write this review. I'm huge fan of the anime series! I think characters were excellent and you even captured the intensity of the battles.Now I know there's going to be a part 2. WELL THERE BETTER and here are somethings I suggest.1. Just stick the anime original soundtrack yes spice in some other things but music from anime is so sweet. There's no need to change things.2. Stick the lore a little bit more. There's so much good content you guys could have included and I know you'll master it with part 2. Just stick to the story.3. Make a part 2. And I figured there's going to be one because it was called ""Agent Arc"" And I can't wait!Thanks so much for making a good live action story of this film. I enjoyed it so much. It was truly nostalgic watching it. There were scenes and character that I saw that instantly put a smile on face. Well it sucks this is wasn't like any other Netflix series were I could get all 3 movies at once but I'll definitely be waiting impatiently."
blackreaper-32360,Not bad for a live action adaptation,10/10,15 September 2018,"Obviously, live action movies are tough. They're really hit or miss. I think bleach did a pretty solid job. Obviously there are some pros and cons, but let's be honest, it's tough to fight in the first 30 or so episodes in just 90minutes. I liked certain aspects of how the movie differentiated itself (slightly) from the anime; it was like watching original content all over again. If you're a fan of the bleach series, I'd definitely recommend watching. If not, then this may not be your cup of tea

Collect all of the swords. I love bleach and everything about it. The movie was great and right on point. Praying that they make a second movie. With the soul Society and all the captains.

phanthinga,This is Bleach live action movie alright,9/10,16 September 2018,Bleach is one of the most famous manga from Shounen Jump back in the day and the anime adaptation run from 2004 to 2012 used to make me and my little brother hyped as hell so lke any other fan of the series I'm lower my expectations despite the one behind the live action movie is Shinsuke Sato a telented director who bring I Am a Hero a zombe movie from a manga with the same name to life and today 16/9/2018 I'm finally got to see the Bleach live action and it surprisingly great.Actor Sota Fukushi who people may know him through the Kamen Rider Fourze series as Ichigo Kurosaki the man character of Bleach for me is like Shun Oguri as Gin-san from the Gintama live action movie which mean he nails the hell out of the character.Ichigo hot head attitude and Rukia tomboy personality on scene in real flesh and blood of a human is wonderful and not a single moment I feel cringe cause they both act like they are friends in real life which make me a bit sad cause if you know the end of the Bleach series they not exactly together as a couple.The Hollow fights to be honest kinda bland when compared to the first fight between Ichigo and Renji and later on the semi fight with Byakuya but when the story hit the Soul Society arc everybody know it all about the Shinigami VS Shinigami with full on BANKKAAAAAIIIIIII so let's fingers cross until the sequel greenlit
juanmuscle,God Bless Asians! period with excla!.,10/10,3 October 2018,"God bless wow, interesting stuff here a lot of stuff going on , lots to learn but one picks up as the action sequences explain further, very cool, very stylistic, very cool, I thought the bad things were really cool and the Asian people were not only pretty to look at , very aesthetic and exotic and cool but they had interesting words and cool words coming out of their mouths once we read the subs! Loved it, didn't look at the Manga I think that's the word but I'm sure its a fine fine book, very fine book, but this was really cool, I love the swords and the different styles , gosh that one dude had a huge sword and could do so much but the main leader guy , he was like old school, though they didn't keep their promises which goes against the whole honor system that is so great about Asian Culture but oh well, still a wonder to seize and enjoy, grab some pop corn and some ice cream and some junk food and sodas and and and it goes quick so if you all know anymore cool movies like this Asian though, write it down so I can see it! Cool very cool...

fffigas,Awesome LiveAction for Bleach Fans,10/10,25 September 2018,"I will try to not create spoilers but i must say i was quite surprised to see this movie because it is so faithfull to the anime :D not only the whole story about ichigo familly but also the parts of high school, the whole turning to shinigami story and the fights and soundtrack are really great together. I thought the CGI would be worst then it really is and even the parts of the drawings of bunnies of rukia are in it . I must say that i missed KON altough i understand why he is not in it but still would be great. That and the fact that Inoue hadn't much of part in the whole movie , would be great to see more of her . I think Chad and Ishida had their parts good but inoue is missed in the movie. Really hope they make a sequel they have all the ingredients to make a better movie then this not because this is a bad movie but because the Bleach anime fans know that the next part of soul society is a great part of history :)

mrc303,"Renji, the character and actor playing him, is awesome in this movie",8/10,19 September 2018,"I just want to say how much I enjoyed his performance. Normally, I find myself not wanting to see the reappearance of the bad guy in movies, but Every time Renji appeared in a scene, I felt like applauding.Regarding the movie in general, I don't know anything about this genre, but still found the movie to be highly entertaining. Casting was perfect, and this is very much a strong budgeted, professionally made movie. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun movie, who isn't bothered by subtitles.

mail-3216,Worth it,8/10,4 November 2018,"Any fan of the series will enjoy this, much of the voice acting in the dub is the same actors from the series. The story covers most of season one, they do skip over a few things, we don't get to see Chad's powers at all. Kon doesn't even exist. There's no mention of what Rukia's punishment is (not anything close to a trial or execution in her future). They also wrap the movie up in such a way that everybody else besides Ichigo doesn't remember what happened.. but the graphics are amazing and quality dubbing. All in all it's a decent watch. I hope they make more to continue the series.

kosmasp,Bleach better have my money,6/10,17 April 2019,"That is if you still buy discs or even the digital version of movies of course. Silly joke about a rap song aside, I have not read the source material this is based on, so I can't tell you how close it portrays the characters. What I can say, is that the movie here has good stunts and action scenes overall. The mystery works for the movie as does the story.You have to like this kind of stuff otherwise you may feel annoyed or irritated. And overall I would call this a decent effort, which makes me curious about the overall bleach universe - I reckon it will be quite complex. If I find time I might check it out.

DuskShadow,You Wont Remember Me...Maybe,6/10,17 September 2018,"Those were the last words in the film.
Which is how I feel about the film.
I enjoyed the anime immensely from the first time it aired on American channels, and even after the show was canceled, relegating its story to only the pages of the manga, I still liked the show. Its hard to adapt things from one medium to another like this, or from a video game. There will always be difficulty in making characters look ""right"" in terms of hairstyles, voices, etc, but the movie here did a fair job of recreating much of the animes style from the first story arc. The spirit was there,and that is all that matters. Hopefully they make more movies to continue the tale. The anime should not be forgotten. 6/10 ^~^ Enjoyed."
leijwells,Must see,10/10,14 September 2018,"Amazing film, highly recommend any bleach fan to watch it. Found that if I watched it on my phone there was no Japanese audio but watching through the ps4 it has Japanese 5.1 so try to watch on a home device and not a portable unless it was just my s9+ that it didn't like.

mashighway,Minor hiccups here and there but it restores my faith in live actions. its a MUST WATCH,8/10,15 September 2018,"Although I have never had much faith in live actions before but this one definitely restores my faith in them. The casting is fantastic and I couldn't have asked for a better actor for Ichigo. He nails the character perfectly and also portrays it very genuinely. Miyavi's Byakuya Kuchiki had his moments. I would have preferred him to be the emotionless stern expression guy that he was in the first arc of Bleach anime but still he portrayed it very well. Isshin Kurosaki was very carefully positioned so his true nature is not revealed nor is there a plot hole where it could have been revealed. Urahara as well. Not much revealed about him either which I liked that way. My only complain is the character of Abarai Renji which sadly the actor nor the direction did him justice. He was not a crazy narcissistic psycho in the anime but has been portrayed as such. 
Now on to the story what I love is that they stuck to the first arc and didn't shove the 2nd arc (Rukia's Execution) in it. They completed the story as well as they could and I really love how they took care of certain elements which have an impact later in the movie. I did have a qualm during the ending as it did not give any hints of the 2nd arc being in the works as there was no indication of it at all. 
The dialogue writing did fall in certain places but overall well written. The cinematography and especially the CGI was very very well made. Fight sequences were the very best that I have seen in anime live adaptions. Overall its definitely a must watch."
sushantmondal-107-897066,An awesome manga film,8/10,29 November 2018,"Most of the times, manga films (talking about live action and not anime) have left me disappointed with the lack lustre performances. The initial 5 minutes or so felt forced, but soon turned out to be a spectacular movie. Its a good intro into the bleach series for uninitiated, and the action sequences are superb to say the least. The only drawback is on the depth of characters, especially Rukia's and Ishida's character development felt too rushed - but with the limited time in a movie, guess its ok. After finishing this eagerly awaiting for the sequel which if made would be spectacular. Can honestly say if this movie was available more widely and in english all over the world, it would give the marvel universe a run for their money.

Sure some parts weren't in the movie, but what did you want? A movie about the first three episodes? The bad reviews aren't justified and they come from very narrowminded people. Awesome movie, good build up, enough character development and Nice fighting scènes. A solid 7,5 OR maybe a 8. Because Lets be honest... A lot of anime gets butchered by the live action movies...

saliaga08,Must See,10/10,16 September 2018,"Finally a live adaptation done right. For all the weebs complaining that they veered from the manga. Check yourselves because yall acting a fool. They fit as much as they could in this adaptation and I effing loved it. I read the manga more than five times and seen the anime once. If you're a true fan you'll love it and if you're new you're going to love it(but read the manga too). 
The characters obviously developed a little different and the story progresses quickly and differently as well. The fight scenes were flipping awesome man!!! Great fxs. Then the actor! I mean come on! Anyone who watches live adaptations know the acting is eothwr a hit or a miss and this was a bullseye fam! 
Watch it! Ignore my fellow weebs who want god like play by plays(which is boring btw) and watch this new twist on a awesome manga come to life!

kelseydudley,For lovers of the Manga and Anime a MUST see,10/10,14 September 2018,"I have yet to see a live action that came out of Japan that I didn't like, but Bleach has hit a ALL TIME HIGH NOTE for me. It covers the first half of the First Arc of the series in GLORIOUS flare. 
Admitted, there are some details that were omitted from the movie, as per usual when we see a book to movie remake. However, nothing was taken out that would have destroyed the story. The only issue I had was that, if you have at least read the manga, then you know that Ichigo did NOT actually kill KingFisher, only wounded it. This movie tells it as though he did indeed kill KingFisher.
That being said...the over-all looks of the movie is spot on to how I would have personally envisioned a manga/anime-movie, to be. The actors and characters are true to their originals, even small details as how they walked or seemed to carry themselves. Sadly in the past, many live actions that we see, their characters seem to loose those small aspects, so in Bleach this is an amazing bonus.
The use of CGI was, as per expected from Japan, used in moderation, but done in such a way that, given this was made from a anime animation, that you don't notice any oddities. Which compared to the American, Hollywood's over use of CGI, is refreshing. 
Bonuses as a Fan of Tite Kubo: HIS ART WORK IS EVERYWHERE IN THE MOVIE! You even see a poster in Ichigo's room of a rework of Kenpachi, from one of the many pieces Kubo would give us in the manga books ♥
One single negative, but still keeping my rating to a 10/10 if you decide to watch this movie. If you decide to use Netflix to watch this, it's a..oddity as per the audio language options. I didn't expect to see English, of course..but..to not see Japanese as a Audio option?? O.o what in the world?? But of course the subtitles do offer English."

WeAreLive,Not a good adaption imo,4/10,27 December 2021,The good;Acting was goodThe special effect were coolSome of the dub voice actors came backThe characters mostly resembled their anime/manga counter parts.The bad:Changed various content from both the manga and anime (the gender of the child Ichigo saved from the punks from a girl to a boy) and when Rukia was forced to back to the soul society he was told to forget about her.Uryu is uselessChad and Orihime don't even use their powers or have much screen time. Though all the former did was catch a falling sign board and warner others to leave a resturant.A lot of the voice replacements were hit miss or down hill.The forced a dozen arcs in one whole movie.Everything else.
cnavata2177,"Enjoyed it, without nitpicking.",10/10,23 September 2018,"This was a pleasant surprise. Fans who haven't read the manga or seen the series will have no problems following it. In fact they might enjoy it more. I found myself just watching it without nitpicking--which is a feat-- so...great job.

ashfordofficial,Bleach: The Soul Reaper Agent Arc,9/10,8 December 2021,"I just finished the Bleach anime and I thought the best way to celebrate is to watch the live-action adaptation.One of the best anime adaptations, mainly because it's made by Japan, not by some narcissistic Hollywood executives looking for butchering another fan favorite anime or manga.The perfectly cast actors (Hana Sugisaki was fantastic) and the tone matched wonderfully and there's some pretty good thrilling moments.It's a shame that they stopped with just one film and not making more sequels that explores more arcs and Ichigo's growth.

Snootz,Raves aside...,3/10,17 September 2018,"If you want a movie that is solid action and little else (or deeply into dreadful anime drama) this may be a wonderful film.If however, you're looking for a movie with substance... not much will be found here. If you're not an anime fan, not into lengthy, drawn-out sword fights and excessively long ""hero angst"" scenes, or are looking for depth such as Death Note... look elsewhere.This movie attempts to create a Greek Tragedy / Gothic romance mixture, but falls short. The story attempts to tell a story of someone rising above his limits and to an extent it does-- but without ultimate purpose or reason. It is typical of this particular brand of anime, but it's not one that mainstream non-Asian audiences are going to find appealing.I've never read the Bleach series; I watched the movie based on the synopsis premise. Based on standard ""is it a good movie?"" measures, I have to say: it's full of action and CGI and battles and more action and more CGI and yet more battles... and if someone is into that kind of thing they'll probably love it. For those who want a little more meaning to the story line, move along, move along. It doesn't have the depth or character development needed to make it anything other than a Japanime action flick.One reviewer called this a ""very cute movie"". Honestly, there is nothing ""cute"" in this entire film. It is emo and angst from beginning to end.Expect a lot of thumbs-down to this review, probably from people associated with the film. Pay attention to the negative review for honest appraisals."
shakera_helm_sweetgirl,I'll be honest...,10/10,14 September 2018,"First, let me just start off with their outfits. No, it's not the absolute best, but it does the job. The swords - ehhhh lol they look awfully fake. They could've done better with that and maybe a bit better with the ghosts too but like I said - they worked with what they had! In all honesty, I love the direction the movie went. They did change a lot which is understandable because Bleach-soul reaper arc is extremely lengthy. So I get why they had to make changes to adjust to the original. I enjoyed cgi graphics, the actors were on point(Especially Sota and Miyabi) they killed it! The fighting scenes were enjoyable as well! Then music went amazingly well with the fighting scenes too! I enjoyed the movie overall, let's just say that. It gave me a very nostalgic feeling of the anime and I really do hope they decide to do a sequel. ITS NOT PERFECT EVERYONE! But it did good for a live-action movie, no hype guys. I know Japan has it record with bad live action movies, but give Bleach a try and you will see for yourself."
bariaylin,Just for Zabimaru I give it a 10,10/10,6 October 2018,"Zabimaru is fricking awesome y'all better watch till the end, best live action ever just because they added the sword.

kambomateo,Not Cringe Manga Movie,10/10,5 December 2018,"It is a fantastic Manga movie. Finally a Manga done right in a live action movie. The build up of the characters is slow as there are more movies to come. We still have a lot to see. The CGI was nice. And the plot is well EPIC. One of the few Manga movies done right. It is a Must see for every fan out there. Keep the good work going

jon_hsieh,Amateur?,2/10,17 September 2018,"I rate movies based on direction, acting and overall production quality. Ive never watched bleach which i thought would be great coming in open minded. I saw a bunch of 10/10. Makes me question imdb users, their age and reputation.If you want a cheaply made film equivalent to a C rated back burner... this is for you. Absolutely horrible. Amateur direction, horrible DoP . Acting is whatd you expect from a japanese anime film...over the top or just bad acting in general which is also the directors fault. Production was probably limited to their budget. But it is 2018 and FX's are getting cheaper.

chapsdanger,Best anime live adaptation.,8/10,21 September 2018,"I admit I watched this movie with some skepticism because live action adaptations of anime tend to either change the entire plot to a point that the movie is awful, don't change the plot enough so the movie is just ridiculous and paced awfully, or just make up stuff completely but give it the anime's title. Also Netflix doesn't seem to have a great track record with live action anime adaptations *cough* Death Note *cough*, This movie however, was the best adaptation I have seen. It followed the source material well and didn't do anything completely outrageous to the main characters. Everything from the acting, the cinematography, fight sequences, and the music were very reminiscent to the anime. I was really impressed and really hope that a sequel is made. If you are a Bleach fan, this movie is definitely for you and absolutely worth a watch.

ralucayr,Better than other anime-based live action flicks,8/10,23 September 2018,"Do ignore the negative reviews. Some people are just impossible to please. Some expected a cosplay runway show or something. Others expected the live action to cover at least an entire arc and a ton of background story--which, if they'd bothered to use their common sense, would've realized that it's just too much for a Netflix feature-length film.Now. I gave it an 8, because, like another reviewer observed, the Japanese have finally tapped into that grey area between manga/anime over-the-top everything, and gritty action movie.I found the story well tied in, from beginning to end. Maybe a little too much time spent on the training montage, and frankly I found Renji and Byakuya's characters to be more of the garden variety psychopaths than high class shinigami, but hey! Hence the 8.I was pleased with the translation from manga to live action. They knew what to keep and what to throw out. I would like to see them tackle more arcs in future feature-length films, though. They work as semi-independent pieces, too, like this one, in case Netflix orders a 2nd but ditches the 3rd, for example. This first one had a decent full circle.If you're expecting this to be 100% loyal to the manga, then go read the bloody manga or drool over the anime. Stop asking studios to be so unoriginal as to simply copy something that's already been made. In core and structure, in world building and characters, in overall tone and nuance, the movie is, in fact, a great tribute to the manga. And it's quite faithful to a healthy chunk of the first arc. I appreciated that.I, for one, as a Bleach fan since the first anime episodes came out (and total Shihouin Yoruichi groupie), loved this. I'm all for it. Just don't expect an Oscar contender or the action/CGI magnitude of The Avengers. Stay. Realistic. And. Enjoy. The. Film.It's well above the average. Thanks, Netflix, for not screwing it up like you did Death Note."
iamkamile,Better than I expected!,8/10,12 October 2018,"You know you're going to be disappointed when you watch an action fantasy manga turned into live action movie, it can be the cast, the story, or the cgi, well you know it. But that's not the case with this one, the casts are surprisingly good, especially Ichigo, Byakuya, and also Renji. I am only a little disappointed not to see any Bankais except for Renji's (I don't know if that's his Bankai or not), but overall a fun movie to watch! A sequel please! would love to see more Erina Mano~

nandanchoudhury,This gave me flashbacks,10/10,22 September 2018,"Any animated feature would be difficult to translate to real people, even more so while converting a long running series to a time limited movie. And that is exactly why this movie blew my mind. Character casting was really good to the point that it gave me flashbacks at points. The story stuck together, character portrayal for most of the roles was really good and the training wasn't half-assed, even some important conversations from the original anime were retained. This made me re-watch the anime again. Really hope it gets a sequel. Worth it!

danishalishimajiri,Insult to the original,1/10,16 September 2018,"Bleach anime and manga were epic though it fell hard over the years and then got cancelled. Have to say that i was very excited that live action was being made and couldn't wait to watch it, now i regret watching it. Characters are nothing like the original, story and concept changed as well which makes this live action feel like it is a rip off of the original.. This was truly an insult to the original anime series and manga, as a fan of Bleach series this was very hard to watch and wouldn't recommend any bleach fan to watch.

bullburke,Wow. Really good.,10/10,17 September 2018,"This is the first live action anime remake that is legitimately good. It's not just good by Japanese standards. It's good by ANY standard. The graphics and special effects look like they were done in Hollywood. The acting is genuinely good. The fight scenes are great. Hallows look perfect. They are forced to change the story some to turn it into a cinematic universe, but that's a good thing. The anime is great, but if you tried to put in all that detail then the movies would be unwatchable exposition. The movie just gets into the good stuff. So good.

gio_vvanni,Japanese aestethic at its finest,8/10,26 August 2019,"The movie follows the story of the manga and it does it in a Japanese aesthetic way.
It's also hard to explain, but watching this movie will let you know what I mean.
Many things are exaggerated but in a specific way, not casual. These ""exaggerations of the reality"" are way more mild than the exaggerations in the manga. Nonetheless they are powerful, unrealistic in their way, totally Japanese and -I must say- they're awesome.
The hairstyle, the way people act and react are totally unrealistic, for example, but really funny, really Japanese, really well-made and, for what I recall, also pretty faithful to the original story.It's a good adaptation of the manga, not a brainless adaptation, not too different from the original. I loved it, in its simplicity-after all it's always a manga based movie with no great pretense.If you read the manga, if you're curious about Japanese stuff, if you want to watch a kind-of sci-fi movie or if you're just looking for the next film I highly recommend you this one: you'll be pleased and not disappointed."

ericschofhauser,Live action Anime done (mostly) right,8/10,2 December 2018,"The film is some of the best live action anime I have seen. It strikes a good balance between being true to the anime/manga while still being it's own thing. Of course it will never be as good as the anime when it tries to condense an entire season into a 2 hour movie. But this one succeeds on many levels, great actor choices and great acting from them. The fight scenes have great choreography and energy with some of that anime magic sprinkled on it. All in all it felt like Bleach and I really hope they make a sequel! This film gives me hope that other future live actions can be just as good. For once, netflix didn't mess this one up. When you let the Japanese make the live action version it turns out properly good and entertaining.

I have only two gripes, both of which can be fixed in the DVD release and in the sequel (PLEASE LET THERE BE ONE)My first significant gripe is that Grand Fisher's girl form wasn't explained as a lure, but rather it's true former life. That doesn't make sense that a little girl would have committed enough crimes to be a Hollow, it made more sense that she too was a lure, and a scheming, male predator was the true soul of the Hollow. Some editing of Rukia's explanation lines and some added evil dialogue from Grand Fisher can easily fix this. My second gripe has to do with Rukia's conclusion, which again can be fixed simply, later in the sequel. Upon Rukia's trial, they discover that not all of Rukia's powers are returned (due to the Hogyoku still in her gigai body) under which premise Aizen uses the Central 46 to seal her in the tower and plan her execution. Ichigo is meanwhile attacked by another Hollow, and lacking the strength to defend his family like he did before, as well as refusing to let go of Rukia's memory and wanting to know how she's doing, he visits Urahara's Shop. Urahara is seen talking to a cat, who tells him that Rukia's execution is proceding.Orihime and Chad will be given their origins in the sequel, too.With these particular fixes, this movie can really stand well."
bernardsia,Require better casting and more budget,4/10,16 September 2018,"Trying not to give away spoilers
1) really poor cast of actors, hardly anyone internalize the individual character issues. the Quincy dude was the worst, followed by rukia. best actor went to the dad. 
2) pretty low budget. couldn't do the season 1 arc on the bait gone wrong. too many monsters mean too much CGI. lets just say it wimped out. overall effect timing was seriously off, especially the main scene where ichigo got his powers
3) so instead of that major fight sequence between hollow, quincy and ichigo the director replaced it with a bunch of scenes not related to the anime. zzz... 
4) seems like the director did it as a one off. may as well, coz it could have been better.

paulclaassen,"Entertaining, if you're into this genre...",5/10,2 April 2020,"'Bleach' reminds me a lot of the South Korean film, 'Woochi', which I absolutely love. 'Bleach' is a well made film, with some really good visuals. The wire effects during some of the stunt work is a bit too obvious, though.The film blends action, adventure, fantasy, humor and even romance to create a multi-genre film. This is a fun, not too complicated film that I can't really fault. (I'm just curious: Ichigo has two very young sisters, yet his mother died when he himself was very young. The sisters refer to his mother as their mother, and there's never mention of another woman in his Dad's life. This is never explained.

jozyangel,Great Manga/Anime Adaption for All Moviegoers,10/10,30 September 2018,"One of the best live action anime/manga adaptations that I have seen. Story keeps the core elements of the first arc and promises improved future adaptions. It's perfect for moviegoers that are not familiar with the mange/anime or would not want to watch 300+ anime episodes.

Vartiainen,"A few promising notes, but overall falls flat",4/10,4 October 2018,"Bleach, based on the hugely popular manga series by Tite Kubo, is the tale of a mortal high school student named Ichigo Kurosaki, who has the peculiar talent of being able to see ghosts. But one night he meets a shinigami, a death god, named Rukia Kuchiki, who reveals that there's far more to the world of the dead than he has ever believed possible.I like a few things about this film. First of all the character of Ichigo (Sota Fukushi) feels very similar to how he is portrayed in the manga. Especially in the early story arcs. Rukia (Hana Sugisaki) is also pretty close. At least character-wise, because her looks are almost impossible to pull off with a Japanese actress. Furthermore, some of the action scenes are not bad and the CGI is very nicely utilized.Unfortunately the story, even though it has been condensed a lot, still feels rushed in most scenes. Some of the characters, like Renji (Taichi Saotome) and Byakuya (Miyavi), are also insultingly one-note and don't feel like their manga counterparts at all. Or rather, they feel like they felt before we got to know them at all, which is a huge wasted opportunity. Quite honestly the film would have worked better had they dropped Byakuya completely, but he's a fan favourite, so what can you do.And yes, the whole film, like almost all of the manga live-action adaptations, is nothing but fan pandering, but there's a good way to do it and a bad way to do it. I get that the makers of these films want to include as much of the good stuff from the mangas as they can into their films, but quite honestly it would work better if they just took the basic premise and streamlined it into an actual working film. No unneeded characters, no cute little side scenes that take up precious screen time. Only what is needed to tell a good story.Admittedly, Bleach is one of the best manga live-action adaptations I've seen so far. It works at least half of the time, which is rarer than you might think. If you're a diehard Bleach fan, you'll probably get something out of this film. If you've never heard of the franchise, there are vastly superior films out there."
Leofwine_draca,Endless lavish action spectacular,5/10,16 September 2018,"BLEACH is another live action anime following on from the Netflix release of FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST. This one's a little better than that one, featuring endless lavish action scenes and plenty of CGI spectacle to bring the comic book antics to life. I should admit that I'm no anime fan so watching this was a new experience for me. The characters are slick and bland, good or weird-looking, which stops the viewer properly engaging in the story somewhat, but the action direction is typically frenetic and the giant CGI beasties are good fun to watch. This is very much along the lines of the 'young adult' genre popular in Hollywood, but generally more thrilling and well made than those films."
nicofey,"It's not perfect, but still good and enjoyable",8/10,25 September 2018,"The Plot : really good, even if someone doesn't read the manga, I believe they still can understand it. The story is slightly different from the original manga, but as for me, it's still enjoyable and I still can tolerate that based on ""Bleach-logic"" or whatever it's called. The Acting : pretty good, I like how they delivered Byakuya's character into live action, his ""aura"" is just like... Byakuya's. And if they're gonna make the 2nd movie, I think they did a good job on developing the side characters (Sado, Inoue and especially Uryu)The Music : so-so, not so good but also not so bad. The Costume : They did an excellent job on this one. They keep it as much as it is as the original.The Set : Just everything like I imagined before I watched the movie, Kurosaki's house, the town, the school, etc. However, the last fight's setting is not exactly like how I imagined, but I guess this one is just a matter of personal preference.
Overall : Recommended (8/10), it's a good live action movie, and I hope they're gonna make the sequel."
nick-schuster,Really enjoyed it,9/10,18 September 2018,"This film stands out as one of the better live action adaptations of anime/manga series out there. I'd recommend watching it.

shnzrns,Here's hoping for a part two!,10/10,23 September 2018,"I havent read any reviews for this movie because I didn't want it to influence my own opinion as a viewer coming from the anime series. I did watch the trailers and they had me super excited for this show. After waiting very impatiently for my chance to watch it, I finally managed to get away from everything just to sit down by myself and watch the entire movie. I wont spoil anything, but I LOVED it! I loved the actors. I know it's almost impossible to cram an entire season into one movie but I didnt feel dissapointed in how they managed it. It was well done. The actors did a great job bringing the characters to life without losing their personalities. My only complaint is I would have added a little more time to it. But maybe thats just because I want to see more of chad and the other character and how they evolve ichigo's character more on screen. I sincerely hope they make a sequel."

owerseer,"Nice attempt, but no cigar.",4/10,18 September 2018,"Ok, so to be honest, this is not that bad, compared to other LA movies (FMA an the like). But that just means that the bar is so low that this can be considered average.The acting is ok, half the time, and the other half is not good. I think the main char is ok, I like the choice of the actor, but many others were quite unrecognizable (like Byakuya, Sado and Rukia). They missed many chances to do cameos, like for Yoruichi (just show us a black cat at Urahara's shop, everyone will get it). Special effects are, well.... fine, but the show is not about that.
It seemed to me that they found everything that made the anime great and removed that. They rushed the story and ruined the flow, characters seemingly do and say stuff that they say in the source material but it is incoherent and not explained in this movie. 
This would have been a much better TV show than a movie. If you don't know the source material you have no idea what is happening and the character motivations are non existent. This seems like a Live Action Clip show or a recap episode, and not a movie.
The characters are mostly different from the anime. In the anime Rukia is dignified (the Kuchiki household has tough her), but Ichigo manages to draw out her real self, but here she acts like a kid, with no chemistry between her and Ichigo.
Renji is supposed to be conflicted and complicated, but in the movie he wears an eye mask and acts like a delinquent who doesn't give a ****. and so in.
All in all, its not that bad, but its not good- If they make a second movie I hope they make it better."

sakakidash,Good movie which feels like an expensive pilot episode,7/10,30 September 2018,"Being a great fan of the manga i looked forward to this movie which gives you exactly what you expect and more untill the very end. That is where anyone will realize the story is ""to be continued."" And left at a stark end. The last minutes of the movie is a desperate attempt to cut ot a story short which no one will believe even if they read the manga or not. The acting is superb. The character portrayal is epic. You feel involved and engulfed in the world of Bleach and you are left traped there.

And they cut off alot from the story line, alot of charcters are missing, the shinigami and the Captain uniform looks like a cheap cosplay!The actors are not matching their profiles, and what about the acting???
What the happening with Renji's and Biakuya's faces??? It looks like they came from FagSociety, they over acting with strange face expressions...The music are preaty good, i loved it! But i wish there were more heavy guitars with different tracks.The graphic effects are awesome!!!! Realy liked the holos!Note for Netflix:
Please make Bleach with the Original story line, make it as series, make evrey episode something like 40 minutes, with a real shinigami uniform and better actors, and don't delete charcters like Kun and Mizuiro, and don't skip the funny parts!
Please Netflix make Bleach Great again!"
alexr-46075,Surprising and way better then expected,9/10,27 January 2019,"I was expecting a crappy movie coming from any anime series up to now, but I instead really enjoyed watching this movie. Of course, it's not a copy/paste from the anime, but it's quite close to it, the original jokes are there, I believe in the acting of the casting. It really made me smile and laugh, like a dozen times if not more, as it was like just like what I remembered of the serie... I watched the anime like in 2005, so it was way back in my memory, but that this the job of kicking me back in those years.Really, I you know Bleach, you got to watch it and you won't be desappointed. If you're new to Bleach, give it a try, still a well-made movie.

Koma-Mo,Surprisingly not as bad as other adaptations.,4/10,26 August 2019,"This is really one of the rare cases where that Japan actually made an adaptation that relatively paid respect to the source material and followed the actual arc that it was adapting. I'm not saying it's perfect, but this film actually did do a decent job. The plot was able to go in full circle and able to show growth between the main leads and none of the scenes felt that it came out of nowhere, avoiding some sort of confusion. Now that being said, this film does follow a certain trend that I've been seeing recently in Japanese cinema, which is hiring actors who are not good, having subpar special effects and not bringing any sort of interesting cinematography. This director does have some experience with other manga adaptations, but I felt that his directing was a little weak as there were camera angles and ways he positioned his camera that I thought didn't work as well as he intended.Regarding the cast, everyone was mostly okay at best and they only sounded like as if they were remembering their lines during the exposition scenes. The only time that you get a sense of emotion from the characters are only when they are surprised, trying to be funny and getting angry. Other than that, their delivery is mostly deadpan. This mostly goes for Sugisaki Hana and Miyavi who were the weakest links of the whole film. Also, the pace was a bit off during the first act where only 30 minutes have passed when it felt that an hour has passed. It does get better and actually becomes more interesting, but I have to admit that I was a little bored for a bit.What these films tend to do is to capture certain elements well while leaving out other things, such as how they made Fukushi Sota's hair orange and have him look mostly similar to the main character of the manga. The Hollows that do appear look pretty cool and I liked some of the action scenes, especially with the montage. The fights are pretty similar to the ""Ruroni Kenshin"" trilogy as the characters are doing these wild movements, but it was somewhat enjoyable. What they did leave out is personality because other than the major character, the rest were either following some generic tropes or had one role with no sort of development or interesting characteristic to them. You have the overly serious character who is very uninteresting, the girl who does nothing but to just look at the hero and the bland villains that either cackle or have a blank look on their face. I know what some of these characters will end up doing and the director didn't do a good job of having me invested in them as none of them were interesting enough for me to see what they will do next. Also, since I read the manga, I knew what was going on, but the film didn't provide enough information for the audience to know what was going on and explained blazed through some important details by using boring exposition. There is a scene during the climax where the villain does something, it might come out of left field for some of the viewers who are not familiar with this series and it may confuse them.Fans may not fully appreciate this, but this is overall an okay action movie. Even with some clunky editing during the action scenes, repetitive jokes and having bland side characters with some mediocre acting, it won't be as much of a waste of time as something like ""Death Note"" or with other terrible adaptations."

investorman,The Accuracy and Detail,10/10,20 September 2018,"Wow, I was actually quite impressed. The accuracy for transitioning from the original anime into live human actors was well done and impressive in many ways. If you have seen the original Anime series of Bleach, it was pretty much as close to possible from drawing out the anime into live action real life action. Since there are tons of episodes of Bleach, the movie combines it all down to basically the first season of the Rukia saga and it ended pretty well to say the least on the timeframe they were able to fit within a 1 hour and 45 minute movie. Well done! and thank you for the live action scenes!

lordmichaelrahl,Well-done adaptation of the first arc,9/10,16 September 2018,"As a fanatic of the anime, I was very worried about this movie.However, even if some elements pan out differently story-wise than in the anime, which is to be expected, and some scenes are a touch over the top, the movie succeeds in a generally faithful and exciting adaptation.The fights are pretty good and the CGI is godly compared to other live-action anime adaptations. All in all, I think this movie deserves a sequel.

lydias_soul,Great Adaption,9/10,15 September 2018,"As a fan I found that this movie was done in the best spirit it could be. It is hard to go from an animation to live action. They did a lot of the action live even if there are some decent CG attempts of the Hollows, which are done amazingly, I was really worried they'd look like trash and was so surprised to find an awesome version instead. 
I was only disappointed that they didn't go more into the other characters stories and that they did change the appearance of some of the characters. Not of fan of the older, not blonde and not hip Kisuke. He was pretty bland and that was a bummer to see. I hope they make another movie showcasing the soul society, but it'd have to be much longer or broken up into a couple pieces."
sailor_julia,Desapointed,4/10,15 September 2018,"Bleach live...
Well it's not a bad movie the cast did a very descent job the costume are great but if you know the manga you will be desapointed.
The relation betwen Rukia and Ichigo. One of the most important of the manga.
In the manga Ichigo is grateful to Rukia because thank's to her he as the power to save and protect his family. When she choose to sacrifice herself, he doesn't hesitate and rush to SS to rescue her with everybody helping him. 
Here we see a boy who became a shinigami and trained for becoming stronger to help a girl to go home, but of course thing will happen.
I will not continue to make more comparaisons between the movie live action and the anime even if I can tell a lot. 
I understand that create a movie about a manga is difficult, especially one with SF.
But changing the story was not the best idea."
JackFiveOffsuit,The high rating is a surprise,2/10,15 September 2018,"I have never left a review of a title but my love for the manga & anime would never allow me to not warn the next person.Let us set the ground rules: Watched the anime past first arc (easiest thing to do). Read the manga (till whatever chapters suits you). Is aware of the Animated movies (watching is to one's own).There was absolutely no reason to tinker the two most sellable facts: The world of Bleach & the blood spilled. And that is exactly what's totally omitted. In fact after battle with Byakuya (who probably spoke more in the movie than the character has spoken in his entire lifetime in the series), all Ichigo has are make-up drawn stitches. The change in characters is horrifying. To the point that independent viewers will barely make through the movie let alone take an interest in this franchise. 
The attempt at CGI is poor. 
Hollows have been turned to clowns with hair growth problems. 
The loss in the heritage of individual characters is appalling. Even their appearances have been changed.
Why would they deviate from the manga which has proven it's success by generating fans across continents is a question which will forever haunt.Live action adaptation are in general bad. Doesn't mean we accept a mediocre product. Which is what this movie is. This should be avoided at any cost. The legacy of Bleach and Bleach fans worldwide deserve better."
adamafrixal,Bleach Felt Rush,6/10,24 September 2018,"Bleach used to be one of three the most famous manga in shonen jump alongside one piece and Naruto. Recently I went and watched the live action film adaptation of Bleach. One thing I have to mention is even though they have some differences in adapting the manga in terms of appearance, I think that casting sota fukushi as Ichigo the main prontagonist is a nice choice as he managed to potray his character well enough.
 The story tells the tale of a high school student named Ichigo who have supernatural power to be able to interact with ghost, and spirit. One time by chance he met a Shinigami (death reaper) armed who use their sword to purify spirit. The Shinigami named rukia, have the objective of purifying dark spirits known as hollow, specifically a great one called grand fisher. When Ichigo and his family got attacked by hollow, Rukia is forced to give her power to Ichigo enabling him to wield the power as Shinigami. This is the start of adventure of Ichigo accepting his new power and facing challenge of spirit world.
 If you are an avid manga reader, you know how interesting the first part of Bleach is. The journey Ichigo took to protect his friends while discovering more about himself stay as the main focus of Bleach in all of its story. The portrayal of Ichigo by Sota Fukushi managed to display this inner conflict within ichigo about what is important to him. To be in danger or let his justice die out. Thus, he choose to protect his friends as Shinigami and follow his heart through many and I mean MANY CGI Battles against hollow and other challenges. The music is pretty fun and pretty much have the same funky atmosphere from the anime series and seems so fitting.
 As I mentioned before, to deliver this story as closer as they can to the manga they need to rely a lot on CGI, which may turn off some viewers. If you like cool battle and CGI moment, furthermore if you are a Bleach fan you should watch this movie. It was a pretty fun ride that stays true to the manga direction, but have too much crammed in it. I believe they make three arc compiled into just 1 hour long film, which I say, do not suffice at all. You will see some story got sidelined and seems not too important or just being there for no further explanation like Ishida Uryuu and Ichigo's friends. Furthermore, they do not explore soul society further and only view it as some sort of cameo appearance, efven though they look awesome.
I believe that this movie is pretty generic to people who doesn't read the manga, but if you are a bleach fan prepare for a nice treat. Nevertheless, through this movie you can see some interesting fight between Ichigo VS Renji, and Byakuya using Shinigami power, which is special treat for the manga lover. My final verdict for this movie is about 6 or 7, considering I read the manga before. 
In the age where there are bad manga adaptation like death note Netflix keeps popping. Movies like Bleach and Ajin can somehow give you hope. Keep your soul clean everyone"
denkigroove-61669,Had potential but disappointing,3/10,16 September 2018,"I've been a fan of the manga for some time now. With all the reviewers saying ""must see"", well I had to see it. Movie is really 30 minutes long if you take away all the pausing and staring scenes. Acting is subpar with characters being so lifeless. Like scenes where his family are held captive, he practically shows little emotion (just before a long pause) then runs into battle. I mean really, what's up with all these long pauses? Had some cool fight scenes but they dragged with guess what, more long pauses... Points for keeping characters and storyline close to the manga. I really wanted to like this movie but it just isn't good. I hope if there are sequel(s), they fix this problem.

garabedian123,Scene for scene recreation of the anime = boring.,5/10,18 September 2018,"Sigh...what a lame adaptation. Why are all these anime to movies so bad? It was exactly like the anime but because it was real the action is not as good and that sword is just a little too big for a person to hold without looking wrong. Why is it not in english...Makes no sense... So this movie had 2 things going for it..the first Hollow looks really good..and the 2nd hollow looks really good...but Looks aside it really has nothing to offer.

steminimini,"Great actors, struggling story",6/10,22 September 2018,"I watched all the 500+ episodes of the anime and Shinsuke Sato's ""I am a hero"" - I liked both a lot, so I thought that nothing bad could come out of this mix.Personally I was disappointed because:the first 66% of the movie is a quick introduction to the main characters and/or their current plus potential future situations:
it's reeeeally well done as it squeezes the most from every single second of on-screen time and all the actors are good if not great (I personally did not like the Rukia character), but you never feel being ""near"" them as everything slips by so fast (forget therefore the feeling of ""community"" of the anime).Subjectively, the remaining 33% was basically the final battle.
It was absolutely nothing special, with repeating sequences (like in a B-movie) and towards the end I was just waiting for the whole thing to finally end.All the knowledge gathered during the first 2/3rds was therefore superfluous and the end was catastrophic => such a movie would deserve maybe 3 points but I admit that the actors were absolutely great (with the exception of Rukia) and that they squeezed absolutely everything out of the few seconds that they had available."
AugustoDRodrigues,Too many things different from the anime.,6/10,21 September 2018,"First of all I need to make it very clear that I've watched the anime and read the manga and back in 2005 I've got introduced in a fantasy world that would become one of the bests in anime history. 
The plot, the osts, the characters and the comedy attached also the animation/art of Tite Kubo made me amused for so long.
All I can say is that this movie doesn't fulfill it's duty, wich is to replicate the first half of the first arc of the manga and anime. I'm saying with all my sincerity that this piece of work here is not entirely Bleach. And here are my reasons:1- OST. Oh boy, the songs aren't here and worse, they got changed for some generic sound. It doesn't have any impact at all in the movie like it has in the anime.2- The plot is almost completelly changed. ---SPOILER ALERT--- In the manga Ichigo do not return Rukia's powers and she is conducted by force to Soul Society in an emotional scene where Biakuya stab Ichigo and leave him to die alone while Rukia enter in the portal. This fact alone is enough to begin the best arc of the anime, wich is the Soul Society. 
Beside this important fact, we don't know what reiatsu is, Ishida don't teach Ichigo how to follow it, Gon is non existent, also Don Kanonji! Dude, they supressed so many things that I couldn't even list them all here. Getsuga Tenshou? Forget it! Any kidou name? Also non existent. Everything is too much rushed and superficial.
To list some minor details, remember that Chad is a latino guy and Inoue have some huge breasts and also orange hair collor, wich disappointed me the fact that she's not in the live action. Too many misplaced things to count. Isshin is more serious, ichigo's sisters are almost equal in age and appearance also have any of their characteristics like in the anime.3- Special effects. Can't even ask too much of them, since bleach is a very difficult and high budget needed one to be near good. Wich's not, in this case, lol. I need to give some props to them for not making it another dragon ball live action.4- Acting is just ok, nothing out of mind and nothing painful. Except for the sisters. Better than Death Note, for example xD.5- Cinematography and Photography are not good. I mean, i'm used to a lot of better movies in this aspect. They could explore better the town, like in the temple part and show us some beauty. We are talking about shinigamis here, souls going to heaven and others getting corrupt and becoming hollows. There are no feelings of good and bad, salvation/doom, there are only some monsters that they need to defeat in order to generically save the day? Big opportunity lost here.So, to finish my arguments it's necessary to warn the newcomers or the people who haven't watched the anime or read the manga that they are missing A LOT of things if they only watch this movie. In opposite direction we have almost perfect live actions like ""Boku Dake ga Inai Machi"" and ""Samurai X"", both completely worth your time and deserve the 10 score. For this case, I'll give it a generous 6 and it's more than it actually deserve. Hope for better anime movies in the future."
siderite,"Decent film, but why not create more anime?",6/10,7 March 2022,"I've watched the Bleach anime and then read the manga to the end. It got silly and there were always those filler episodes that I couldn't stomach, but it was also fun. Now, this adaption is well done, with most actors doing a decent job and reasonable special effects, but it only covers three or so chapters and then it veers in another direction. How could you possibly cram any significant part of 686 manga chapters in a single film anyway? Also, not so fun.And while the manga/anime was showing Ichigo deciding to help and interacting with all kinds of characters that were more or less honorable and strong, in this one Shinigamis are petty bureaucratic and honorless. Not to mention... no fun!But what was sad for me was how much resources they wasted in the film. They added Chad and Orihime, but did nothing with them. They spent minutes on training montages and minor skirmishes with street bullies and they added the storyline of Ichigo's mother being killed by a hollow, which in the end did nothing for the story. I imagine they hoped to turn this into a live action series or at least a long series of films, but then this is just a really long pilot for a totally failed show.I don't get it. Why not make more anime and instead go for live action? You pay actors more, you risk more, you can't shape scenes the same way. Also, not so fun!! So my conclusion is that this was entertaining, yet utterly pointless. As adaptions go, it wasted time and it went nowhere, failing to grasp the core of the manga, as a good film should have."
kendrickkeeton,Fun movie,7/10,20 December 2022,"I enjoyed most of it except the ending. I would have made a different one and found this really lame. You spend a couple hours watching a movie and you expect a payoff... not in this one. It felt unfinished.The main character seemed to have trouble wielding his sword. Perhaps the props department didn't know how to make it lighter? It kind of broke the immersion seeing the main character struggle to swing it around. Even a CGI sword would have been better.Overall it's worth a watch. I wonder if there is a part 2 to this? I would watch that and might have to check out some other similar movies to this one.

PennyReviews,Good Enough,6/10,26 September 2018,"For a live action, Bleach was decent. As I haven't watched the anime nor read the manga, I can't say whether this one was close to the original. However, the overall experience was entertaining. The battles were there and the graphics, even though the monsters were not that well made, when it came to the action part, they were really good. The story, in addition, had a starting point and an ending and therefore it was easy to follow even if you haven't watch the anime. Also, the performances were excellent. However, the hair and costumes of some characters, looked fake and ruined the fantasy atmosphere that the movie had to have to carry on. So, 6 out of 10.

g-46617-60348,A good reproduce of the original story,10/10,19 September 2018,"As a lover of the original series, I have to say this film did quite a good job in condensing those stories into a film-length while keeping the core of the characters. Although there're still several weak points, one can clearly see the character arc of Ichigo which is extracted right from the manga. Of course, the premise is that you understand what BLEACH tell readers.
This one shows a promising future of Japanese live-action films and should be taken seriously.

it is clear that no one involved in this movie was a Bleach fan .
this movie was made by people who do not care about the anime
and is intended for people that have not watched the anime .
it is not bad . it is good . just not for people familiar with the franchise.
if you do like the franchise ,this movie will make you mad . scip it and re-watch the anime .

beowulf_darkknight,The best live action recreation of an Anime.,10/10,16 September 2018,"I used to be an avid Bleach fan back when it first appeared on Adult Swim. Having followed the series until the very end, along with the OVA's and Manga extras, Bleach had always been my favorite.I've watched some of the other live action recreations of some anime series over the years, none of them coming close to being as on par with the anime as this one, although Full Metal Alchemist was a close second.I was impressed with the special effects and the acting, something that was lacking in, say, Attack on Titan. The movie closely follows the beginning of the series, and even though the version I watched did not have subtitles, I could follow along and basically understand most of the dialogue. It was really well done and I am looking forward to any future Bleach movies as long as they stand up to the quality of the first."
rezaeifrank,People stop whining about the live-action movie,10/10,18 September 2018,"The casting was good, the actors were good, the acting was good, the CGI effects was good, overall everything was good even though there were some major changes to the story but hey this is a low-budget live-action movie adapting a series that has 366 episodes and the first season having 21 episodes or so so of course there is going to be cuts here and there cuts they made are understandable people need to stop whining about why this and that is not there and what not. I am more excited about the small glimpse that we see of the Soul Society and how that story will turn out if they ever continue making a live-action movie of BLEACH which will be very exciting that's what makes me like this movie because of the potential it has of being great in the next film as well. Now of course I know how the story goes I was not very excited about watching it because of knowing how the story would go about but liked it because of the good acting CGI and everything else that made this movie a stand-alone of its own that was good.

leathd-97648,Great for what it was,9/10,15 September 2018,"This did not attempt to take an anime and make it realistic. It stuck with the concept and made an anime-esk live action movie. I enjoyed it from this aspect. It was a very entertaining movie that deserves praise for what it did well.

Emhilradim,"This film muddles its way between story elements, but misses the mark somewhat",5/10,22 September 2018,"I don't know how much of the script was cut from the final edit of the film, but I imagine that they could have kept some of that material, and expanded the length a bit with some scenes that were fairly important. It's hard to discuss why I have issues with this film without talking about spoilers, thus why this is a spoilered review. I feel that people are too quick to say ""THIS IS DYNAMITE"" and have even seen some people with criticisms who still gave the film a 10 star rating, but 10 stars is perfect and this film ain't that.--Costumes--
The costumes for the characters are somewhat acceptable. For the everyday character scenes, it's pretty much what you'd expect a group of Japanese students to look like. But things fall down a bit when you get into hairstyles for female characters, and costumes for the shinigami. The biggest example that stands out to me is Abarai Renji. Renji at this time should be wearing a pair of goggles, but instead they seem to have went with a sleepwear night mask, and it was such a huge piece too, so it covered a good deal of his head to the point of being distracting. As to hair, several characters stood out to me, which is Masaki, Ichigo, Yuzu and Orihime. These characters are supposed to have orange/blonde hair. Masaki's hair is black, Orihime's hair is black, Yuzu's hair is black and Ichigo's hair is black with blonde highlights. Kubo said he was ""concerned about the idea of a Japanese character with orange/light hair,"" but these characters aren't really supposed to be fully Japanese.--Casting--
Casting for the film was .. interesting. The Shinigami could be almost any age really, as these characters are supposed to be hundreds and even thousands of years old, but the bulk of the cast are supposed to be high school students. The youngest of the high school student actors/actresses is 20. These are supposed to be 15 year old students, and one of the actors is 31 years old. He certainly doesn't look 15. As for Renji and Byakuya, I did wonder which of the two was older between the two actors.--Characterization--
This is where I had some real issues. While the brash and carefree Karin was somewhat accurate to her character, the Yuzu character actually came off as the more crass between the two, which flies in the face of the original character (who is supposed to be sweet and sensitive). Isshin is fairly accurate, but lacks a bit of his freespiritedness. Ichigo is fairly accurate. Chad was fairly off, being aggressive in a way that didn't make sense for his character (in the manga he never throws a punch at a human, instead defeating his opponents by absorbing their blows until they collapse in exhaustion). Orihime was very different, acting more like a boy crazy girl, and Ishida lacked the haughtiness and scorn that characterized his character at this point in the manga. The shinigami on the other hand were mostly perfect, although Urahara was almost completely skipped over in the film, having less than two minutes of total screen time. Many supporting characters were omitted, but this was of course for run time sake, as there simply wasn't enough time. Also a really odd change of tone was the Rukia-Ichigo relationship, which comes off as almost romantic, with Rukia having an otherwise inconsistently emotional moment with Ichigo.One thing this really lacked was Ichigo's sense of propriety, he makes a reference to the fact that he's not noble enough to sacrifice his life for others, but also isn't able to stand by and let those around him be bullied or killed needlessly. But they go nowhere with it. Also for some reason they changed the gender of the ghost from female to male, no idea why they did that, though I guess it doesn't really matter.--Length--
The film comes in at roughly 1:45 in length, and I would have liked if they had gone for another 45 minutes. There was probably plenty of material that they could have included to complete ideas they started, but didn't really finish or even explain to the audience. If you know Bleach, then you have an understanding of what is supposed to have happened, and how certain things get resolved, but this film lacks those elements. An example is the soul bait plot, the element is introduced, but is pretty much discarded after only 5 minutes without any real resolution or explanation to an uninitiated audience who might not have read the manga as to what the heck just happened. I'm not saying that they should have spent 2 hours on this plot (like they do in the anime), but I feel like they should either have more adequately covered this plot, or cut it in favor of more important scenes. Also the training montage could have been cut completely.--Story--
So far as story goes, this film is somewhat true to the source material, but it spent too much time condensing down all the material in the first arc, and it changes certain dynamics and characters (and completely cuts out supporting characters who are fairly important). Certain story elements are revealed early, but without context for the audience to understand what's going on, and I don't think your average viewer really understands some of what's happening even when they try to give it context. An example of this is the size of Ichigo's zanpakuto, they mention how big his zanpakuto is, but they never establish why it's that big or why it matters that it's that big. And in the final battle, the enemy shinigami don't even seem to notice or care about its size; to explain this, a zanpakuto is typically supposed to look like your standard Katana but for Ichigo his started off being triple the size of a normal Zanpakuto, this is because of the raw amount of reiatsu or ""spiritual force"" (power) that his character possesses, though we find out later that size isn't everything, and that captains would wield Skyscraper sized zanpakuto if they weren't controlling the size and density of their zanpakuto. Also that Renji and Byakuya have their spiritual power reduced by 80% while in the normal world to protect the spirits around them from being influenced, thus why Ichigo is able to defeat Renji. For that matter, they don't really discuss spiritual power or why Ichigo breaking the demon magic spell in the beginning matters...For pacing concerns major chunks of the story are omitted (although I can't imagine why). I feel like they should have kept the original shinigami hunter and omitted Renji/Byakuya until the very end where they appear as a cliffhanger to pique audience interest in the manga/anime (and maybe future movies), and left off with Ichigo defeating (but certainly not killing/destroying) Grand Fisher, and Rukia accepting that she's currently stuck in her situation. Instead we get left with a pair of cliffhanger elements that might very well never be explored, and completely flying in the face of the entire story of Bleach. There's no real reason to even have the Soul Society arc with the way that this story wrapped up, and nothing to set up any of the stuff that's supposed to come next.I feel like there was an abundance of ideas, and a bit too much ambition that went into the film. But on a budget of $3 million, I suppose time wasn't the only thing that the movie needed more of. I was pleasantly surprised with how accurate the hollows were, and at times it was hard to tell which effects were practical and which were completely CGI, which to me is a good thing.I didn't hate this movie by any means, but I felt like they really killed a lot of the film's potential by rushing through things too quickly, and trying to shoehorn in plot pieces that just didn't fit. The film could have done with half of the material for the first arc, and merely allude to the second half to open up potential sequels (or just get the audience to read the manga), but instead they took a semi-complex story and boiled away some very important elements to try and create a neat and tight little package; but this package is neither neat nor tight. They set up plot pieces, and then they leave them hanging with no resolution. They tried to cover too much with not enough.This isn't a bad adaptation, it's just a very poorly executed one."

vladcotorogea,It could have been worse,7/10,30 November 2018,"I don't usually write reviews but this is a special occasion because I am a huge fan of Bleach. The movie was overall good. I loved how they introduced the characters in such a small amount of time, however the problem was how they portrayed the villains. Renji looks extremely fidgety here. In the anime he is very determined but here he looks like he has a problem with everyone. Of course, it's the actor's fault. The same for Byakuya. Here he is extremely talkative and the acting was done very badly. I remember Byakuya not showing any emotion whatsoever. There was a review that perfectly described the bad guys: cosplay. The CGI was better than I expected. Overall a solid movie, but with bad character development (too less screen time for certain characters).

rdamian1963,Too much in one movie,6/10,13 December 2021,"This is not a bad live action adaption of the manga series. The action sequences are reasonably well done. However, the movie tries to cover too much of the series in a single movie. It would have been nice to see this as a series or multiple movies. I hope to see more live action movies made based on the series.

gbarrett-39941,Enjoyable!,7/10,23 December 2021,"Live action remakes of anime and manga are hard. This one was done fairly well. I would have rated it hire if they didn't alter the story so much. Also, while they worked to preserve the hair color and style for the male characters, there was no attempt with the female characters. This was an easy fix that should have done. Also the lost souls didn't have broken chains coming from their chests, instead they had bloody faces. Wacky.The action was good and the acting was decent. This was an enjoyable adaptation."
manken-33850,Many people agree Bleach Live Action is good,10/10,20 September 2018,"Bleach Live Action is quite good, if it is discussed by a professional person. They are not a matter of giving opportunity, but their judgment is wise, and thinking adults can also give appreciation. I'm not a fan or hater of Live Action, but I know what's good and what's bad. I think Bleach Live Action or Rurouni Kenshin is pretty good and most people think the same as me. And in other things or other films like FMA or Death Note I think this is bad and most people also think the same thing. People say ""why don't they learn from another bad Live Action"" this is abigu, this should mean they can learn better, right. And those who give a bad rating here, they are really not open minded and only negative thinking.

Action was very great, the characters was well portrayed, the pace of the story line was very good, soundtrack and music was exciting.I felt the only downside of the film was the lack of secondary characters development, but It's understandable due to the time limit from a standard movie length.

mrsamsharma,Sugoi! If you love anime/manga you need to watch this!,10/10,16 September 2018,"I've never been a fan of anime/manga re-adaptions, as they never seem to work & are often seen more as a joke - look no further than the Dragon Ball movie & Street Fighter (the one with Jean Claude). Not to mention the issue of white washing characters, again look no further than Street Fighter - Legend of Chun Li & Death Note, as well as the two mentioned before. I am delighted to tell you that this movie does not suffer from any of the aforementioned issues.
The casting is perfect, the story stays true to the manga, everything about this movie is brilliant & brought back such wonderful memories - I was just waiting for the 'Senbonza'.. 
My only criticism is that there wasn't more! I wish they did 2 hour episodes, however many necessary to cover every arc! 
I can't wait for the sequal- ""Orihemeeeee""

yeolit,Excellent presentation despite altered storyline,8/10,13 October 2018,"I am a bleach enthusiast, and have read all volumes of the manga, and a few hundred episodes of the anime (reason being I'm very fed up with thhe lame filler episodes).This Bleach movie is, without a doubt, one of the best being brought to live action. Of course, I would still rate Gantz: Osaka as number 1. For the storyline, the first half of the movie was great, although it lacked a certain flurry doll which is a great deal of comic relief and altered certain details to suit the later half of the movie's plot. The way the movie was presented was excellent, like the camera angle, transitions, scenery and music. Thus for the first half I would rate a 11/10.The second half though (which is the climax), is kinda dragged out, and after a while it starts to look more like a regular sword fight than a fight between shinigami (death gods). A lot of details were missed, like for example when a shinigami with a high spiritual pressure is present, those with less will get suppressed and fall to the ground (much like the Commander's haki in One Piece). In this case it should have happened when Byakuya was present for Ichigo. But still, some of the deliberations and emotional parts were still presented splendidly.Overall, if you are a Bleach fan, it might be a bit of a letdown, especially since CG effects were quite limited, but of high quality. Plus some details that make Bleach's starting arc great were totally excluded. However, if you are a non-fan then this would be a good starting point before you go into anime or manga. The anime is generally better than the manga due to presentation except for filler arcs and episodes.In conclusion, great presentation but weak later half of movie sorts of spoils it a little."
littlejtxox,So god damn good,10/10,21 September 2018,"I had given up on anime being turned into live action, they're always so bad. But oh my this was so good!!! Obviously things weren't perfect but it felt right? I mean I dunno why, it just felt like bleach.

deandsouza15892,I want more !!!,10/10,1 March 2019,"Maybe after watching so many chaotic and disappointing live action adaptations, I didn't think anime could ever successfully transition into reality. But I'm happy to say, I'm just blown away. This movie is incredible. It's so clear that the director has a lot of love in his heart, because he's delivered a PERFECT Bleach live-action film. The only flaw I have,is that the characters don't look too much like themselves, but that's easily forgotten since every other aspect has been nailed spot on- the dialogue, the cinematography, the fight choreography, the comedy and especially the punk-rock soundtrack. It's very reminiscent of the anime Bleach represents. The filmmakers treat the source material with respect and deliver the first arc of Bleach, in a very believable way. I honestly want more of this; if the entire show was adapted this way, we could see amazing stories. As a fan of the anime, this movie is solid

gagadansmailbox,We need another movie!!,10/10,16 September 2018,"Loved it, amazing job to say the least. If you've watched the anime this movie relates so much to it in every way, all the little easter eggs and references, a must watch for fans and new comers a like! If you haven't watched the anime watch it !

robert-82664,another great anime destroyed by the movie,1/10,15 September 2018,"As a fan of the anime and the manga this movie was garbage. they changed the personalities and the way they interacted. they just jumped all over the story arc combining things together that had nothing to do with each other. changed major parts of the story. to me this movie is as true to the manga as the Deathnote movie that came out a while back. another case of someone altering the characters and story because they never followed it or researched it before they did this

naoyashiro,"Occasion boring, mostly enjoyable manga movie.",4/10,6 September 2023,"I've never seen such an opening in movies (but I've seen a lot like this in mangas.) The movie was a bit cheesy to look at, the drama was overlong and occasionally succumbed to overdone, the plot held clunky execution of the settings from manga, the story promoted patriarchy, and the actors did melodramatic performances sometimes. Nonetheless, Sota Fukushi is likable, the straightforward story succeeded at times, and the battle sequence was tricky and interesting. Overall its uniqueness is off the charts. Occasionally boring, but mostly enjoyable manga movie. I don't like it, but it's interesting to watch when you feel bored at 3 p.m.

sinaporia,"If you miss the movie, then you did a good thing.",2/10,15 September 2018,"Not everything in this movie was bad... the important thing is, they did read the manga and so it is still better than Dragonball Evolution... ugh... 
And even though i knew some changes would come along so this is not the same as the manga or the anime, its still not a typical Bleach feeling when i watch the movie.
They tried so hard to get things right.. but the movie got so many things wrong. Like Zabimarus weakness... no suddenly zabimaru can just continusly attack with no restrictions... 
Biakuja got no problems to kill humans.. i mean he was kinda a dick in the 1st and 2nd season.. but not that way. and so on.. the story got so many flaws.. and i cann't understand how anyone can give this movie a good rating. 
And how they gonna make a sequel after that ending.. if Rukia is forgotten by everyone.. how do you want to save her or not....... and by the way even if ichigo wanted to return rukias power.. isn't that against the law?... 
Like i said, to many flaws, if it wanted to follow the manga even if it was just a bit, they needed to put the soul society laws in as well... and this movie really to got any of that"
franz_badz,Good enough to score an 8!,8/10,11 October 2018,"The author of the manga is involved with the production thus this work of art is his vision of how Bleach would come to life in a realistic setting.Characters:
We all know that it is near impossible to perfectly cast an anime adaptation. This is because anime characters are overly dramatic and when you copy paste it into reality it would come out awkward and a mess. I am a little bit disappointed because they changed the personality of some characters though.Art:
They made a pretty good job considering that this is not Hollywood. I believe they made use of every resource they have. We could have seen better but not everyone have the money to do so.Story:
This is the hardest part to adapt. Because, same with all anime, the best parts are scattered across the whole show and you cannot just expect to compress a more than a hundred episode anime into one film. That is crazy. However, they made a good job with this one. They adapted the whole season 1 of Bleach. Some minor events was left out, but it is fine because those are only little bit of development and it does not really affect the story as a whole. The only problem is that, season 1 of Bleach is probably the 2nd most boring season in the whole series, of course not counting the fillers. But of course they cannot just jump straight to the soul society arc right off the bat. Which means they do not really have a choice.Conclusion:
This is a promising movie. I only gave it 8/10 due to the fact that Bleach truly shines on its later story arcs. Season 1 is pretty boring thus why the movie also came out a little bit of a mess and not that appealing for those who are non fans of the anime. With that, I hope that this will go on as a trilogy or maybe more than that so that they can truly show the beauty of Bleach.Recommendation:
This is not a movie fitting to be viewed by people who does not even know Bleach. I guarantee you that you will have a high chance of being disappointed. However, I highly recommend that you first get acquainted with the anime in order to appreciate this good movie."
xsinisterdollx,Must see!,10/10,28 October 2018,"I dont watch Anime like most ppl do but I have watched enough to know about Bleach. So when I saw this on Netflix I had to watch the trailer and that alone got me intrested beacuse of the amazing graphics. After watching the movie i have to say wow! This was absolutely amazing! From the graphics, the actors, the music down to the wardrobe. Everything was great! So much so I really really really hope they make a sequel! There is so much more to the story that they have to continue it! Plz ! Dont leave us hanging and take us to the soul society!!!!

Janebo,Sugoi dayo!,8/10,26 November 2020,"Okay, so I never read the manga and never watched the anime...and I LOVED it.
It doesn't hurt all the guys are cute...and all good actors. I've been a fan of Yosuke Eguchi for years, glad to see him still relevant, in a small but important role.
Some of the costumes were a little light, like the scabbard for that massive sword could have been a lot more, but these are small things.Guess I'll have to read the manga and watch the anime now. And I hope they do another live action sequel, this was very entertaining, even the monsters were well done. If you are a fan, I can't imagine you didn't like this.
8**** Well done!

josaccapadi,Hands down the best adaptation,10/10,18 September 2018,"For an anime adaptation, this has to be the best one out there. It stayed true to the spirit and much of the story line for the first arc. This gives both hard core fans and newcomers an entertaining and action-filled vision of the anime series. The character exploration of the main characters was great, and if there is one drawback is that would have loved to see more of the character exploration of others. Given the length there isn't enough time but maybe a sequel can cover that better.

If your not planning on continuing on the series, don't start it."

cierrascornerblog,Awesome,10/10,4 August 2022,"I loved this movie! It jumps right into the main characters live and his story, it keeps you interested and engaged. There were funny parts and though the character growth was fast paced because this was a movie it was well done. The hollow (bad spirits) were so well detailed and a combination of interesting and scary. I really enjoyed it and was sad it ended so soon. I know absolutely nothing about the anime Bleach, so this definitely makes me want to dive into it. I highly recommend for action movie night!

hogan-13430,Bleach 2018 - Soul Live Action Anime Adaptation,10/10,2 August 2023,"This Movie is directed by Shinsuke Sato, who has a decent amount of experience in making live-action anime adaptations.I am a fan of Bleach in particular my favorite character Rukia Kuchiki and therefore I decided to express my opinion about this film.Let's start with the fact that the film adapts the first arc of the manga - ""Temporary Shinigami"" and unfortunately the film could not reveal all the main characters (for example, Orihime Inoue or Yasutora Sado), we were shown them of course, but in a very truncated form in the style they are in the film , but we will not disclose them.The main disadvantage of any anime adaptation in live action is that it is very difficult to show the full potential of the film in an hour and a half and you have to change a lot of things, change and cut down the original content and the plot from the manga, which then creates a feeling of understatement and the thought comes to mind, that you need to find deleted scenes or rewatch the anime or read the manga.Personally, I liked the film, it has a lot of potential that unfortunately was not revealed, but it has a cool atmosphere and soul that I really liked!1. Opinion on Adaptation characters:Sôta Fukushi (Ichigo Kurosaki) - He coped very well with the role of Ichigo and in fact, in my opinion, this is a 100% excellent hit in the role, respectHana Sugisaki (Rukia Kuchiki) - She played my favorite character Rukia very cute)) I liked it, although I would still prefer to see the canon hairstyle from the manga)Ryô Yoshizawa (Uryû Ishida), Erina Mano (Orihime Inoue), Yû Koyanagi (Yasutora Sado), Taichi Saotome (Renji Abarai) - As I said above, there is a list of main characters whose potential has not been revealed, for example, the character Uryû Ishida seems to have begun to be revealed, but in a very truncated form, Renji Abarai is great just as a feature (beautiful action scene)Miyavi (Byakuya Kuchiki) - He was very poorly adapted as a character, in the original Byakuya poses himself as an emotionless aristocrat (any emotion he has is already a big event for an anime/manga) with a lot of fighting experience, and as a fan it was very embarrassing for me to see the he adaptation.2. Computer graphics:CGI graphics turned out very cool, hollow looks very intimidating and dark, action scenes are beautiful and decent, respect3. Music:It sounds harmonious, but forgettable, it was necessary to take the music from the anime series.Verdict: The film turned out to be good, and it is pleasant to review it, of course, it has many shortcomings that ardent fans who are ready to find fault with any little thing may not like, but it does not matter, the film has a soul and potential for something much more."
memodurans,"Bad acting, production and overall awful",4/10,23 September 2018,"The movie is a typical redundant overdramatized low-budget Japanese movie. the lead actor is the worst thing I've ever seen. Dialog is tacky as hell, I wish the movie would have another approach on the making of a real version, based on the original anime series, I just feel sorry for this movie. I gave it a five-star because I can notice there is a lot of things that are worth, but it just doesn't deserve a decent review. Could watch it for more than 2 minutes without skipping forward.

It gives the source material a more realistic feel that translates well with how an individual would have to train in order to reach a certain level of strength.The pacing takes it time to familiarize the audience with the world and characters, and does not rush, unlike a lot of other movies that need to put everything in at once.

freskimkamishi-66639,Boring Boring Boring,1/10,8 October 2018,"Maybe I find this boring because I've never seem the anime. But, really I just lost 2 hours of my life. 
Bleach is so sloooow that I almos fall asleep. I even skipped some scenes at the end because it was so slow and boring. My advice to you guys it to not see this movie because it isn't worth it. Ohhhh almost forget, the acting man it was so baaaad couldn't watch it.

VoodooBangla,The meme of the Netflix adaptation can be no truer.,3/10,31 December 2019,"Do yourself a favour and just read the manga. The anime was lackluster too, due to the arbitrary side storylines. If you HAVE to watch this terrible, terrible adaptation - watch it in the Japanese dub. It makes it less cringy but only minutely. Even with a decentish budget - certain things only look good in traditional animation; even a multi-billion dollar corporation like Disney, this is no different.

toastytherapy,"For an adaptation, not bad",7/10,19 September 2018,"Summary: Great movie for a bleach casual fan or new to itThe Good: The Story and character development is good, the Hollows were surprisingly well made, the action was 8/10, the changes from manga/anime story was acceptable. Ichigo was almost spot on, Chad was pretty cool, Inoue is cute, I had my doubts about Rukia and Ishida but they do fit as the character.The Bad: Netflix subtitling isn't great; some Japanese emotions were subtitled when they just needed expression; ""Howl Zabimaru!"" became ""Hear the Zabimaru roar!""; soul reaper,/shinigami cut to just reaper (reaper makes me think of the hood and the scythe). Costumes were great (except Rukia's latex glove) until Renji and Byakuya. Good costumes for a people who don't fit the characters. I just wish Urahara, was more witty and cocky but i can let that slide.The Ugly: 
Renji is MUCH shorter than Ichigo, face is roundish and does not feel like a rough and tumble, fighter and survivalist he is supposed to be. Actor over exaggerated the simplest of emotions and was just awful. Best role for him would be Keigo instead. Best replaced by the current Byakuya which would be perfect. 
Byakuya should be played by the actor for Ishida or someone more sophisticated and elegant.I would like to see more but the ugly parts need a lot of improvement since the next portions give these character more pivotal parts in the story."
jo_men_visst,"Wait, is this the correct imdb entry?",5/10,30 September 2018,"On a lark I thought I'd try to watch this version of Bleach. I love anime in general but have never actually seen more than a few glimpses of this franchise even though it supposed to be in the top 3 of long running shounen jump stories, along with One Piece and Borutos Dad if I remember correctly. Ok I may not be a huge fan of the never ending battle anime genre (I tend to think that if you cannot end the story within 100 episodes you're probably just treading water) but I've seen enough to get the tropes. And as I said, I kind of randomly decided to see this movie version on netflix tonight. And... Yeah, it kind of exists. It doesn't anger me in any way, but it doesn't wow me either. Effects were decent, I recognized characters, nothing upset me. But... It's so bland. So run of the mill. Pop idols pretending to be school kids pretending to swing giant massless weapons at monsters with no presence. And in the end status quo was achieved so they can repeat the major beats in the next part. At times it was so blatantly held back by its source that I at every 20 min beat or so expected hiragana in a corner of the frame to spell out ""tsuduku""/ aka ""to be continued"" and that a jpop song would accompany the episode credits.But no. They just stand there awkwardly as the next ""episode"" autoplays. It's probably one of the main reasons I usually prefer the parodies of these shows (One Punch Man for example) because they can be more creative and actually subvert the expactations that we have as an audience. Do something unexpected. Something new.But this one seem to have a checklist of all things the fans want and it checks them relentlessly. Judging by the long string of 8-10/10 reviews on here it seems it was enough. I was simply not the audience they aimed at. Or is it that the bar is set so low by the endless barrage of downright awful feature length liveaction adaptations that the fans are just happy to get one that scrapes by with simply being not offensive? Who knows. I just wonder where the live action adaptation industry in japan are hiding the people with actual creativity? And why those guys and gals never get to make an adaptation that actually blows their audiences expactations away and are actually great? I mean, Japan has no shortage of talent. But none seem to be able to be tapped for these adaptation projects."
elstefal,Almost perfect But the...,8/10,19 September 2018,"The live actions is not espected ,but it was cool.the character fot Urahara is too old he should be younger(am sorry but if he is as old as that i would other captains be eg aizen and norowici,kenpachi e.t.cthey are quite young cos they dont age fast too)everything else is almost perfect. Wow u nailed rukia character she almost like the anime except the hair. I would love to watch more"

wgihanm,Brings Hope for Anime adaptions into Live actions.,10/10,20 September 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed how they adapted the anime into this movie. they Kept the core of the whole anime alive and made it very enjoyable, Extremely amazing acting by Sota Fukushi (Ichigo) , He nailed Ichigo's behaviors and emotions perfectly. The casting was done close to perfect. This movie delivers to me personally because im a huge bleach fan but its adapted in a way even a new viewer can understand the story's purpose. This Movie proves that animes can be adapted into live actions if its done correctly. PS only thing i miss from the live action is the amazing music from bleach.

kenball-59118,Worth the watch. An issues of time.,7/10,15 September 2018,"I'd like to break it down a bit. It's a good showing with some problems. It's a product of genre, not the film.The actors selected are good. Ichigo is great. Many of the other actors are great or good. Excellent casting. It's hard to live act an anime, when so many things are exaggerated. I think the cast did a good job normalizing actions that aren't normal, and over the top. Some of the costumes (Byakuya) are hard to duplicate in the real world, and be believable. Good work with what could be done.The story: the story somewhat follows the anime. Pieces of it match the anime, though in a different order or setting. We've seen the anime and read the manga, so a little variance isn't so bad. What's the point of telling the same story we've seen, in the same way. The result is much the same, just arrived to in a different way.The visual: The graphics are not bad, though not great, it's a Netflix show after all. It does well as a visual showing, but wouldn't be considered a big budget movie.The big issue: Time. The fact is, they shoved many episodes of the anime into a relatively short movie. Much of the plot, especially the character interaction, has to be crammed into a small amount of time. Compared to the anime, which could run several episodes to establish the relationships, they had a short amount of time to do so. Because of this, many of the relationships from the show, had to be rushed in this movie.Overall thought: The movie is good, though suffers from many of the issues that come from making a live action movie based on an anime series (dragonball z and fullmetal alchemist). I'd be interested to see more movies made, especially if they were able to bring back the same actors as this one.If you read this, thanks, and I hope it helps"
adg62442,M Night Shyamalan Should Watch This,7/10,22 October 2018,"This is how you do a live-action Bleach. The characters look and act like themselves and it's a great adaptation in general. I had hoped Avatar would look something like this, but maybe I was asking for too much. The shinigami have been done justice too as well, which I thought would pose a problem, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even better than the Death Note movie.

luchianlaura,A good story made into a poor action movie,5/10,15 September 2018,"I don't mind action movies, I just don't like poor action movies. Also, the whole Bleach story is way more than an action story and this movie made it something superficial and shallow. The screenplay ruined it.
I did like the costumes, the details like the zanpakto (Renji's made a really good impression).
The actors were rather good. Better than I expected. Too bad that the script distorted the characters that much.
The music too was good.
The 5* is for the good parts mentioned, otherwise I don't think I would have given it that much.

It just doesn't work with real life actors.
Too much of the original story has been changed, it's all just very awkward and has no flow.

firewing-54336,Poorly Done...,3/10,20 September 2018,"Turns out it's really tough to squeeze 2 seasons of an excellent anime into a 2 hr movie. Not sure if it's impossible, but they certainly didn't accomplish that here. I'm a huge fan of the series, so I was disappointed with the sloppy, rushed attempt to squeeze every main character from the first several story archs into one movie, many of whom played little or no part. The pacing was uneven and character development was weak to non-existent.Fans of the Anime series will likely just be infuriated at the changes they've made and the poor execution of a favorite.Newcomers will just be confused and bored.

bankaixero,Bad,1/10,6 February 2023,"I've been a huge fan of og Bleach anime since it began airing. However, The film feels like a lame summary of several episodes.Production was mediocre to okay. Casting could have been much better but the acting was okay overall. The writing needed to be better; a lot better. The story was the biggest disappointment for me. It just didn't feel right. It was a struggle for me shortly after I started it and grueling to continue watching after about thirty minutes or so.Bleach could have had great live action films unlike most but unfortunately it does not live up to expectations.I don't recommend this to anyone.

karokfish,Amazeballs!,10/10,30 January 2019,"The only other anime-to-live-action movie I've seen is Full Metal Alchemist... yah, so I didn't go into this with high expectations. In fact, I downloaded it to watch during my commute home. Within 10 minutes, I had to stop cause I knew I had to watch it on the big screen (just my TV) AND I'd have to get hubby to watch with me. Within the first 10 minutes, I could tell it was in a whole 'nother level compared to FMA.
Hubby and I absolutely loved it! I couldn't get into the specifics of manga volumes or series episodes but kudos to screenwriters and director for condensing what feels like a couple of seasons into less than 2 hours.
True, some characters didn't resemble their anime versions - the first couple times I saw Renji, I lamented that he was too short; Byakuya was a bit short too but the actor played the character so well that it didn't detract as much as Renji's lack of height.
At no point did the CG characters or special effects pull me out of the story. So well done!
Now I have to set aside another time to rewatch in English.
I wonder how many times I'll end up watching this....
And they have left the door open for a sequel which I hope gets made."
andjmas,Why?!,1/10,16 September 2018,"I barely got through 5 minutes into the movie and found 7-9 mistakes they made. My personal opinion, if you're going to make a live action of a very popular anime, at least make it look like you're trying to follow the anime series as well as the manga. This is just another live action film of popular anime's that were poorly done in my opinion and these companies need to stop

juceanpesa,Quite decent but end lackluster wich could be fixed so easily and be a great aniame adaptation.,6/10,1 November 2021,"The film overall its quite okay, just some decisions just dont make sense.As someone who watched all the watcheable content of bleach including fillers (not manga) im quite happy with the result.Some decisions just dont make sense wich could been so easily fixed.Stuff like the hair of. Yuzu bein black instead of brown. Or the fact that Yuzu did all the house chores on Ichigo's house.Chad not bein latin at all (he is mexican) and Orihime having flat chest (while in manga she got unproportional chest for her kind of body) not saying she should had a massive front but perhaps even a push up bra could done the trick and the fact she didnt had her emblematic hair pin.Tatsuki having the hair that Rukia should had, instead of getting the ""Goku"" look kinda deal. And making her care about Ichigo when on the first arc her only priority its Orihime.The fact that Rukia got short hair instead of long and on this adaptation Rukia personality (wich on this particular arc its quite perky) wich was serious the whole time.Fights are okay more or less, the fight vs ""grand fisher"" felt too long and involving way to many cars destroyed.Rukia losing all her powers when she just gets weakened but still bein able to shot ""hados"" (fireballs like dragon ball)And all up to that point its a solid 8. (if mistakes fixed)But then when you could hit that Chad and Orihime percibe the hollows even for half a sec they dont.And on the last part the fight Ichigo vs Renji should been Ichigo winning most of it until ""Zabimaru"" comes to play then goes one sided to Renji.They went with Ichigo beein able to beat Renji even with ""shikai"" on.But at this point Byakuya.gets in the fight and goes for his sword 3 times. When could finish it on one swing.And Rukia sacrifices and makes Ichigo lose her memory.Wich to me, makes no sense. You could have the same movie just ending it with Ichigo lying in the floor after beein beat up by Byakuya and getting Rukia kidnapped.That sets you for a sequel. That gets you people interested in the anime or manga.Will Rukia be rescued? Will Chad or Orihime get powers? Does this mean Ichigo will die? Why Renji sword gets long?.All this questions would make you want to watch a sequel.But no. They went for this random ""you will forget about me and nothing happen maybe"".Ichigo its okay after getting cut 3 times by Byakuya murdering the resource of ""doing one cut and then saving your sword"".Uyru (glasses bow guy) its okay like nothing happen after getting stabbed on the lung.The movie after all its a decent adaptation. CGI its on point tells you the story somehow good, makes an old fan remember why he loved Bleach.But could been great and that hurts as a old fan.Still im happy with the direction anime adaptations are doing.After the tragic mistake of dragon ball or the awful Death note one. (wich to be fair in this writter opinion its a awful anime as well).Its good to know that movie writters are slowly buy steady making better films and calling people to anime and manga.POS: Sorry for mistakes english not native language."

ekarlin-52993,"Great Movie, Not very Accurate",6/10,21 September 2018,"This movie was a great watch, But it didn't follow the manga or the anime very well. It was overall very inaccurate. I loved both the manga and anime i was hoping for a multi arc movie franchise, but this is a stand alone film.

lineshebotha,I am confused by the hype,3/10,22 September 2018,"Honestly, were we all watching the same movie or has everyone's expectations and standards just become that low that they see this as a good live-action adaption? It was mediocre at best, and cringey at times. A lot of background information was left out, and I get that not every single detail from the manga and anime can be put in a movie, but if changes are made, do it right so that everything still makes sense and feels like it can stand on its own woth no gaps in narrative. Orihime and Chad were irrelevant to the plot, and should either have been given more background or less screen time. Why establish a charcter and give them that many appearances if you aren't going to use them? The emotion and overall develoment of all characters involved, especially Rukia and Ichigo, as individual characters and as friends, was rushed and I didn't make me feel for them. I didn't care what happened to them in the end, as there was no emotional build up or realistic development in their relationship. I find it hard to believe that they were so willing eager to sacrifice themselves for each other.The point of this was more to look cool, than to make logical sense plot-wise, which was achieved with the costumes, CGI (mostly), and the random pauses, where the characters pose, stare dramatically into the distance, smirk and say cringey 'bad ass' one-liners that just ruined the effect, looked stupid and awkward. This was no better than Death Note. Both are equally bland and not worth watching if you're looking for substance story-telling. The father (and the two sisters) were this movies only non-cringey and redeeming quality. Also the mother."
tjcworld,A lot of room for improvement,7/10,19 September 2018,"Many of the actors seem quite talented but their lines, at least in the eng sub, are a bit rubbish. Renji was overall a very generic live action japanese villain, over expressive and weird, with a leather headband shaped like his goggles in the manga(??) but Zabimaru was great. Best bit was the Byakuya fight, though he didn't give off the beauty and gostly reaper atmosphere of the OC. The hollows looked great but for some reason they made them into dumb monsters which reduced the sinister aspect of them. Ichigos Zanpakuto looked fake."
natsukaarei,"Different from the manga, in a bad way..",1/10,30 March 2023,"I can't understand why they make this movie in the first place. This movie is really unbearable since I read the original story from the manga. Some of the cast is ok, some the other is meh. They try to mix and compress a lot of story from the original into 1 movie which turns bad!They include a lot of characters in the story but they don't have any importance to the plot like chad and orihime. They make appearance in several scene but that's it. They don't contribute to the plot, so I wonder what's the purpose including them in the movie. We don't even see their power in battle.Some custome and makeup also turn bad because it was very different from the original. I understand for Rukia hair adjustment so it doesn't turn out weird if follow the original. However, others like renji abarai and byakuya kuchiki, the ghost boy, the grand fisher, every thing pretty much different from the original.Grand fisher doesn't sound evil or manipulative.e Kuchiki byakuya supposed to be cool and cold but here I only see an awkward old man, far from cool. They replace Renji visor with decorative leather headband. Urahara supposed to be cool and happy go luck with mysterious and charismatic vibe but here, he is lack of personality. Also, Urahara only appears only for a second, they totally skip his role in Ichigo growth. There's too many more flaws to mention."
reirey,"If there's a zero, i would have given a 0",1/10,16 September 2018,"1. What happened to their Hollow detector thingie? It used to look like a mobile phone. How come it looked like a bar of soap now?
2. Orihime. She's flat.
3. Renji was supposed to be wearing a visor, not some leather something on his forehead. He is also short. Shorter than Ichigo. Almost same height w/ Rukia.
4. Ishida looked like a dork.
5. What happened to Ichigo and Ishida's showdown? Why did they removed it? 
6. Where were the side characters? 
7. Ichigo's sword was supposed to be cut in half when he fought Byakuya. 
8. RUKIA DID NOT REGAIN HER POWERS WHILE SHE WAS ON THE HUMAN WORLD!! SHE GOT IT BACK AFTER HER GIGAI WAS DESTROYED BACK IN SOUL SOCIETY.
9. WHY DID THEY MAKE EVERYONE FORGET HER?"
thelastarboy,Netflix level,4/10,8 February 2020,"I can't believe i listened to people when they told me this was a good one..
It's like watching some cosplayers do a video...heck maybe a fan made one would look better....seriously why is rukia not a petanko? And wtf did they do on the actor selection for byakuya and renji...karin is not tomboyish..orihime does not have you know what i mean

partyupob,Great first try,7/10,1 January 2022,"Don't listen to the other viewers who don't even know the source material. This is a retelling of the first arc of bleach. The characters remained the same as they did back then.The good:
The characters were very accurate. Rukia and Ichigo are age appropriate.The CGI was good too.The story. It's so close to the beginning its great.The bad:
Dialog. As with any anime adaptation its going to be cheesy.Renji's height. He should be taller.Those other reviewers talk about stuff not even related to this movie its just sad."
lucasbullrun,Worst ending ever!!,1/10,20 November 2022,"OMG I have seen some horrible flicks and this ending of the movie was The absolute worst ever out of the several hundred movies that I've seen and maybe thousands in my life this is the absolute worst ever. To have such a great storyline all the action and different things that happen throughout the movie I thought it was going to have something unique and special at the end but when it came to the end it literally just ended without Nothing More not having anything to do with what I had previously seen and expected something incredible however the ending was like the creators just gave up and was like OK screw it let's just in the movie and boom that's all that they did was just stop trying and stop it all. An absolute train wreck of an ending totally not worth the time watching and I hope no one else goes through this BS of a downward roller coaster that it ended to be because roller coasters go up and down and all this did was go downhill into the pit of an oblivion that it exhists in.

luffypsarjun,This movie's making level good and perfect but the script was very bad,5/10,5 October 2023,"Bleach movie is so bad I don't like it but the making level is so perfect I like it but the story is not good the script was very bad worst movie I ever seen but the movie characters I like it rukia ishida ichigo orihime chad they're all perf theect I enjoyed the film being unaware of the manga and anime but even after watching 8 seasons reading 7 volumes my opinion stand still. This live action adaption of bleach is actually pretty cool and at times more faithful to the manga than the anime itself the acting is pretty cool with the casting working as a major plus to match the likeness of the most of the characters from the source material,if not all.

richardsj2081,They got Ichigo's family dynamics right...,6/10,28 October 2018,"All in all it wasn't the worst anime to live action I've seen. However it could have been a lot better. If you're only going to do half of the first Arc or even a quarter of it at that at least fill it with background story instead of passing over everything. Still worth of Watch but not at all what I was hoping it would be or what it could have been.

mathiasskrabbe,I should have watched this earlier ... !,7/10,11 December 2022,"Surprisingly good and faithful adaptation of the source material! Always thought that out of the 'big three', Bleach would be the easiest to adapt. In part because the main protagonist starts out in a more familiar setting (especially for Japanese people), and gradually we are introduced to a well-crafted fantasy world.However, after seeing several live-action adaptions of beloved anime like Avatar, Cowboy Bebop, and Dragon Ball turning out so rotten, boring, or straying too far from the mangaka's original vision, I think, many of us have developed some sort of distain for live-action even before watching. Which is a shame! Especially when it comes to this Bleach live-action movie!Sure, the acting, CGI, and music choices is so 2000s that it hurts at times. BUT it doesn't take away from the amazing story that Tite Kubo crafted and drew, which should get a broader audience that 'just' manga readers and anime watchers!"
aurorabaer,oh no,1/10,12 October 2020,"God has abandoned us. I used to pray every single night, wishing my lovely daddy God himself for sweet dreams and good things to come. But now, this movie has opened my eyes to the truth. All I get now are scream-filled nightmares and images of cheap ginger dollar store wigs haphazardly thrown onto a random civilian's head. I have lost my ability to believe in anything meaningful. I did not have a lot before this movie, a brother that loved me and a dog who would stay by my side through thick and thin. Now they are gone. I used to hear God answering my prayers each night. But now there is only cold, dark silence.

demonic-52638,Another live action fail!!!!,1/10,3 February 2020,Whilst a film cannot follow the pacing of anime episodes I still feel that they messed up the source material so much as the shape of ichigos sword is wrong the hair colour of orihime is not right or even close they fight people at the wrong time and the outcomes of those fights arn't even the same outcome considering ishin kurosaki was the one to defeat grand fisher!!!!!! I was very disappointed in the pacing and mismashing of events. It didn't even include a menos grande!!!!
markok-52368,Not so bad not so good,5/10,1 December 2018,"As bleach fan I must say I'm a bit disappointed because they didn't stick to original storyline.Its all messed up.One moment u think""they skipped something ok let's go"" and then they just go back and mix up everything.CGI is nicely done I must say.Characters are pretty much nicely done except Chad.I mean really???Chad is not Japanese and he isn't just a skinny guy but okay.They tried at least.Anyway 5 stars just for CGI and Characters"
tzepdefcs,Yes and Not,9/10,3 January 2019,"I was waiting for this for a long time!!Pros:
1.THE REAL MOVIE !!
2. Very good visual effects (Not Michael Bay excessive visual effects - which is a plus)
3. Follow the manga and anime on 99% accuracy.
4.Story flow perfectly and even someone that have no idea about Bleach could understand it without problems (My mom 69 years old liked this movie)
5. Great fighting scenes.Cons:
1. Voice overs - At least bring the real voice over actors from manga....
2. Soundtrack - ""You have to drink your milk""???? Like really?? That song for an action/fighting scene?? =))
3. Their shinigami outfits looks like a low budget cosplay.
4. Isshin Kurosaki actor is not even close to the one from Manga, sadly....and jumbo ears Rukia ...damn...dont want to be a hater but im sure they could be better.
5. All actors are very small compared with Anime characters. Renji looks like a 14years old kiddo, Ishida looks like the one from Anime but at discount height...etc.
6. No confirmation for next part/s."
masterado-31758,Not Bleach,7/10,23 September 2018,"I like Bleach, I've watched the entire anime and am planning on picking up where it left off in the manga, and this was a good live action representation of Bleach. Get ready to have the whole movie spoiled.First thing I will say is, if you are the type of person who can't stand it when adaptations change from the original. Don't watch the movie, because it is different. Characters are cut out, scenes are removed, and characters are changed. Yuzu is the snarkier sister, Chad throws someone, no Menos Grande or Getsuga Tenshou, and Renji and Byakuya replace the Shinigami hunter (let's be honest, he was just the middle man and nothing more, Raditz was more useful than him). That's not everything, if I listed everything that's different then this would be much longer. The biggest difference is that this is a movie, the original Bleach is a series and manga, so things will be different. They aren't going to spend as much time setting up characters or giving screen time to characters who don't do much in the first season as that is all the movie covers. At the same time characters aren't getting cut when they are fan favorites, so you will see Chad and Orihime, but they won't do much. Seriously, why should they show off Chad and Orihime getting powers if they aren't going to use them for anything important?Personally, I think the first season of the anime (up to Rukia getting sent back to Soul Society) just sets up for the second season, it's not an entire story on its own. Of course, that doesn't work for a movie. If the first season isn't a complete story, then they have to make it a complete story. This means cutting out parts that are more or less irrelevant. Yes, Ichigo and Uryu fighting the Menos Grande was cool, but they didn't have to add it in. All it would do is give some extra screen time to a character who doesn't need it for the purpose of a movie (Uryu) and showing us a monster that doesn't do anything.The story is changed a lot, but it still feels like Bleach. Grand Fisher (the hollow that kills Ichigo's mother, Masaki, was the main antagonist) and it worked. It wasn't accurate at all. Uryu helped him, the fight started in the forest and went to the city, and Renji and Byakuya showed up afterwards. Not at all like what happens, but it made for a good story. This is my first movie review, so I don't know too much about actual criticism. I was just tired of seeing a lot of 1 star reviews with no better reason than, ""uhhhhh it's bad cause Orihimime's rack is smaller, and Renji is shorter, and the Soul Pager looks different"". or stuff like, ""Real Bleach fans should stay away or they'll be shocked by all the changes."" They're not bad changes. They're changes that either don't matter like how the ghost in the beginning is a boy instead of a girl, or changes that were made to make the movie, a movie instead of a pilot episode or first season. Grand Fisher makes sense to put at the end of the movie for two reasons. It was a climactic and personal win for Ichigo that was satisfying to see. And, there is NOTHING Ichigo does that tops it until we get to the invasion (which isn't in the movie) Yes, he fights and beats Renji, but he is no match for Byakuya and Renji has had 80% of his power stripped away. If they put Grand Fisher in the middle like in the actual anime, then they would have to throw in the Menos Grande fight, which was less satisfying of a win and overall pointless and introducing Uryu, a character who wouldn't show up again, or use half the movie to set up for fighting Byakuya and Renji, which would have been a HUGE disappointment. If a movie is made on the first part of Bleach, then the Grand Fisher fight is really the only thing that makes sense to build up to. Yes, they make a LOT of changes story-wise but it's not because they don't know what they're doing or don't know the source material. It's because they're trying to turn the first season into a story that stands on its own and doesn't demand a sequel. At the end of the movie, Rukia pretends to hate Ichigo to get her brother to spare him and ask for a chance to redeem herself in the soul society. She gets her powers back and Ichigo loses them and his memories of Rukia. Rukia delivers a monologue thanking Ichigo and saying that he won't remember her...she thinks. Ichigo manages to see something Rukia left behind by accident and smiles. They wrote the ending so that it can make a decent conclusion while also making the Ryoka Invasion possible. It's possible her monologue could be given before she receives news of her execution. Urahara is in the movie, so he is capable of delivering the news to Ichigo. Chad, Uryu, and Orihime have all met Urahara, and would all have a reason to go. So, if a sequel is made they have everything they need. If it isn't the movie can end like it is. Ichigo is grateful to Rukia for saving him and his family and giving him the chance to avenge his mother, while Rukia is grateful to Ichigo for being the first person to risk their life for her and being her friend. And that's what they are, friends. I seriously don't get how some people think that the movie was trying to make those two seem romantic. It's a story about two friends who want to protect each other out of gratitude and because they both see themselves at fault for endangering the other. It's not romantic. Overall, the story is good. It's not the Bleach that anyone is used to, but that doesn't make it bad. The writers had creative freedom and they used it wisely. Other than story, there are other great parts about the movie. The Hollows looked surprisingly good, the fight scenes are good and anime (it's anime, the fights are unrealistic, if you couldn't figure that out already) as they can be. The music choice, while not as good as the anime's it's still alright. (Really wish they played Number One at least once) and the cast was well portrayed. Especially Chad, Ichigo, Issin, Orihime, and the sisters.Now onto the bad parts. Not all the characters and actors were great. Uryu felt lifeless, Byakuya was even more of a jerk, and Renji seemed like he didn't really care much about having to kill Rukia and a little crazy. Some is the fault of the actors and some is the fault of the writing. Renji and Byakuya did not look too good. Everyone else was pretty nice. Byakuya was a huge jerk, and I don't mind that he talked way more than he does in the original, but if he was going to talk the way he talked in the movie, then he was better off keeping his mouth shut. There were a few missed opportunities, like having Yoruichi in cat form in Urahara's shop just hanging out, or playing Number One, or having Renji or Byakuya comment on the size of Ichigo's Zanpakuto. The relationship between Rukia and Ichigo could have been expanded on a little more. They don't explain anything. They're assuming anyone who watched this has watched the anime or read the manga and understand what's going on. I don't care because I get it, but that is definitely something that would turn off people who haven't seen or read Bleach. I give it a 7, maybe an 8. I'm not saying it was perfect. There were definitely flaws in writing and acting, but it was a good movie. I said before I'm no critic, so there are definitely going to be things I didn't catch, but I'd say this is a good watch for a casual movie watcher and Bleach fan."

pupwoi,"Probably the beat live action movie, baicst on an Manga/Anime I've ever seen",9/10,12 October 2018,"There's a few things I think they should have had in the movie, that they left out, for example Orihime should have had orange hair like ichigo, and ishida should have had a tint of blue in his hair.
And then there's the thing that ichigo should react to Rukia's drawing. But it's only small things like that they missed. I don't mind that they change'd the time line a bit cos they can't have all in the movie. They had good fighting scenes and good choreography and good timing. The hollows weren't the best but not the worst. The actors hit the personalities of there characters really good in my opinion. And with that said I hope to see more bleach movies!

cmcknight-54097,Bleach Live action,2/10,19 November 2018,"I just watched the first scene. So far very disappointed, they didn't even use the correct terminology. Ichigos hair isn't even the right color, it's just a hint of orange, not full orange like the anime and Chad shows emotion, which he doesn't do. And instead of soul reaper they just say reaper and it sounds awful and they don't say gigai and they try to transfer powers back, which doesn't happen in the anime"
bumblebee-30846,Amazing live action,10/10,21 September 2018,"Panel for panel the same as the manga and anime, except for the fight scenes. Ichigo takes on grand fisher and renji Arabai in part traditional Asian fight scenes pet shines jump anime styled sword play. Makes for one of the best live action anime's in be ever seen (read as: ever directed) it feels like a movie you'd watch in a theatre. I hope it isn't a one and done!!

akhgeo,Finally a good live action movie!,10/10,22 September 2018,"This movie was really well done. As this was a live action based on the Anime, which itself is about hundreds of episodes, i did not have much expectations before watching it. After finishing the whole movie, I can say this was the best live action movie i have seen to date!The CGI was used really well especially the hollows. They changed the story line a bit to fit with the movie, but mostly stick to the original anime plot.The actors did pretty well, especially Ichigo, renji and the quincy. A fun movie to watch. I rated this 10 as you rarely see a well made live action.

icmandp,The story line was way off,3/10,19 September 2018,"This live action was horrible with the story line. If anyone that has watched bleach knows that this is a huge derail from that show. The only reason why I'm giving ing this a 3 star is because of the graphics
