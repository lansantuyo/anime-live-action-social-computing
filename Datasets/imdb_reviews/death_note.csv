GomezAddams666,I wish I could rate it ZERO,01/10,25-Aug-17,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!Netflix's Death Note - SPOILER Review.I believe a movie THIS bad deserves to be completely spoiled, if anything to be avoided like the plague.Director Adam Wingard has achieved the impossible, he has taken the title of ""Worst live-action manga adaptation"" away from Dragonball: Evolution. DBE doesn't even come close to the complete disregard of source material this horrendous movie is guilty of.Nat Wolff's Light Turner is nothing like Yagami Light from the manga. Light Turner is a bullied kid who starts his killing spree with a bully. Besides that he is a scarily child who is in way over his head with the book he's been bestowed upon so he reveals his secret to his High School crush, a cheerleader named Mia Sutton (Margaret Qualley), which we are supposed to believe that on the mere sight of the book becomes a raging psychopath that wants to kill everyone, and I mean everyone she feels like, and this was supposed to be the new version of Misa, right?All the intelligence, all the cold and calculating aspects that made Yagami charismatic are completely gone, instead of Death Note we get ""The Killer Diary of a Wimpy Kid.""But nothing compares to what's done to L. The famous detective who is also cold, incredibly intelligent, and astute, is horribly played by Keith Stanfield as a maniac, and frenzy detective vigilante of sorts. Too many times in the film he loses it and even comes close to murdering Light in cold blood, either by running him over with a car or by shooting him. That is something L would never do.The book has about 70 rules, and they are revealed when it is convenient to the plot. And not even Willem Dafoe's Ryuk can save this abomination, his character appears like 10 minutes of the film, and Ryuk is not a bored Shinigami anymore, in this version he is a sadistic god of death who enjoys seen people die.Adam Wingard is a complete hack, someone who either did not understand the manga, or thought of himself better and more capable to tell this story than the original writers. His movie is not even worthy to be called Death Note, it is barely worthy to be called a movie as it is an outright blasphemy to the manga and the anime. It is by far the worst live-action adaptation I have ever seen.I rate it 1 out of 10, simply because I cannot rate it lower on IMDb. I had to watch it hoping I was wrong, but I encourage you to stay away from this filth."
Platypuschow,Death Note: Where would I even begin?,02/10,25-Aug-17,"The original Death Note was a masterpiece, some of the legitimately smartest most well written television of all time so all these years later hearing it was getting the American treatment I was understandably concerned.Sadly my fears were confirmed, all of them. It's as if the creators were given a 30 second explanation of Death Note and based a movie on what they were told.The characters are simply nothing like the originals, the plot is a compacted mess, this simply isn't Death Note.Light has gone from an arrogant, smart, cool calm and collected person to a weak screaming baby.L has gone from a savant secretive quirky quiet child to an out in the open gun wielding threat spewing idiot.Misa has become Mia and no longer a ditsy blonde bimbo but now a devious manipulative brunette.The original plot? Forget about it, straight out the window and something that misses the point of the story altogether in to replace it.I could rant about what an embarrassment this is for ages, I think I could quite frankly write a book on how much of a slap in the face to the fans this is but I'll resist.But make no mistake, that's exactly what this is.The Good:Willem Defoe as RyukThe Bad:An offensive cluster crap to fans of the originalLight Turner........really!?Terrible representation of LightTerrible representation of LTerrible representation of Mia/MisaMisa becomes Mia.....really!?So........many..........changes to the rules of the Death Note!So........many..........changes to the plotThe soundtrack during the big wheel scene.......really!?"
Come-and-Review,A clumsy and thoughtless adaptation with a few highlights,03/10,25-Aug-17,"I'm often on the defending party for films. I notice that many reviewers seem to complain much about any movie is released. That was the case with Alien: covenant, for example. That movie was far superior to this one. Prior to the film, I watched in about three days the entire Death Note series. Because I really just got into it and don't plan on watching the anime again soon, I don't consider myself a fan (never watched animes before, by the way), but I reckon it was a very clever series. At times it had its cheesiness, but still worked pretty well. When the source material is well written, I don't think that departing from it is the right choice. The Martian proved that, for instance. Changching the plot should be always for the benefit of it, and not to overly simplify the story and to take out some of it core aspects.Death Note's film adaptation chose this second route. I have the feeling that they didn't understand at all what was the series about. The anime mostly focused on L and Light's intellectual fight, battles of tricks and making one and another be unsure about what his intentions are. Ryuk (who I thought would be a practical effect and not CGI, as instead it sadly proved to be) had more importance. Truth is, this movie had also a very low runtime in order to cover up the plot well, it might have needed an extra 40 minutes (so a 2h 30m film), but it would have needed an entirely different plot.Instead, when the movie finished, it turned out to be just a rushed sequence of events, most of which seemed incoherent if seen next to the anime, which was a very clever story. Ultimately, the film settles for a needless and overly bloody gore feast. The speed of this film is so fast paced that, by when I arrived to the 1 hour mark, I could not believe that we had forty minutes left. And I came to realise that nothing that happened felt relevant to the whole storyline. Death note should have been adapted in a slightly slower paced film, and had minimal gore (most of people died by heart attack). That wouldn't mean that it had to be necessarily a boring film, or a non-R rated one. The themes of moral ambiguity and killing powers make it anyways a very dark story to tell.The only positive note I could find in all of this is that sometimes both L and Light's actor delivered scenes which made me suggest that they where up to the roles, if the original anime was to be followed. L sometimes used the anime character's same line delivery, Light seemed capable of behaving as a bloodthirsty, dark and evil character. Sadly, the movie didn't allow the actors to perform their characters rightfully. Williem Dafoe's voice sounded exactly like the original Ryuk's. That said, Ryuk appeared for about 4 minutes, so there wasn't much there.Ultimately, this is the perfect example on how an adaptation of a good source material can simply suck. I recall only Eragon being such an unfaithful, unrightful and almost offensive adaptation to a very clever and deep story."
LaLaLandSucks,A movie that gets 98% everything wrong,02/10,25-Aug-17,"This movie was a mess. From a directional standpoint, to acting, to script writing, everything. The VFX is horrible in this movie. It's so low budget, you'd imagine it be a cheap TV show. Ryuk's forehead is too big and feels nonexistent within the mise-en-scene. Light Yagami is everything wrong, changed to a bullied kid to feel politically relevant and correct. He's just eccentric, over the top, and a creepy looking mofo. Mia is supposed to be Misa? She is changed to a typical short girl cheerleader who follows Light around. Also, why would anyone name their kid Light in America is beyond me. This movie was rushed. From the start, we already see the book falling down. There is no build up to this or tension, it just falls and it's one of the cheapest looking movie production props I have ever seen. The design is something you'd see from a fanmade film. Then, the title sequence. They got the colors right at first, but then they went with complete blue, when it should be red and a bit of purple. All of the dialogue is awkward and choppy. Terrible line deliveries from each actor, just overcooked and several mumbling moments. The deaths were immoral, stupid, and just goes to Final Destination B-movie horror territory. The writers they hired wrote Immortal, a terrible movie with Henry Cavill. So, it was doomed to suck to begin with. They hired Adam Wingard too who directed the overrated The Guest. He's just bad, they should stop hiring him. His camera tricks are cheap, choppy, and horrible to look at. Blair Witch was unwatchable, this one is almost too. Ugliest looking cinematography of the year, muddy, unsmooth, bad shot composition, and student film level. The music choice is pop/techno like music and it is all wrong. Death Note was Gothic, operatic, and heavy metal. The only thing they got right was Ryuk's voice.2/10."
TrundleTheGr8,An absolute disservice to the source material,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I don't even know where to begin with this, it is rare that an anime adaptation ever turns out to be good, so I didn't go into this movie with high expectations. Having seen the anime twice now I was completely underwhelmed and disappointed throughout the whole movie. The characters in this movie had little to no similarities to their originals. There's honestly way too many things for me to say about this that I simply just don't have the time to do so. I tried to watch this movie as it's own thing and not compare it to the original but that was basically impossible for me. If you're a fan of the anime and manga, honestly don't even watch this, it's not worth your time.

BeyondEternity,Skip it and watch the original instead,02/10,25-Aug-17,"As a fan of the original Death Note anime I am very disappointed in this film. It was poorly acted, horribly paced, and the drama felt more edgy than composed. The characters personalities were completely changed to the point where I didn't see why they even bothered maintaining the original names and The events of the story were changed so drastically I forgot that I was watching Death Note. In the original anime both L and Light were very calm and rational in how they made each decision, creating a suspenseful psychological drama, but in the film both of them do things that were very out of character and essentially made no sense. Overall this felt very rushed and poorly directed, I wouldn't be surprised if the director had never even heard of the original anime before doing this film.

AntonioCalcano,An insult to the original Death Note (Desu Nōto),01/10,25-Aug-17,"I have never felt compelled to write any reviews but I felt that I needed to say something for this movie.I normally like Netflix TV shows but movies lately have been really sub- par with this one being the worst I've seen from them.This is a total waste of time and this movie should have never been made, it's an insult to the original Death Note (Desu Nōto). The plot was totally ruined since it was changed from the original, yeah they kept the premise but they decided it was a good idea to mix it up with stupid teen drama/relationship and a bunch of other nonsensical BS.Go watch Desu Nōto instead if you haven't or if you have then watch it again!

TheLittleSongbird,Death to potential,03/10,01-Nov-18,"As others have said, the source material is amazing, full of depth, cleverly intricate with complex themes and characters that feel real. So there were glimmers of hope that the film adaptation would be halfway decent on its own, despite a lot of people hating it. Really did want to like it and be one of those people to go against the general consensus, which has happened quite a few times before (though have found myself agreeing with critics more and more these days, seemingly a sacrilegious thing to say these days with so much over-the-top hate for them).Sadly, 'Death Note' is yet another film that sees me agreeing with the general consensus and what they have said about it. Not much for me to add. It is not just that it is an abortion of an adaptation, that is the complete opposite of every element of the source material and completely forgot in translation what made it so great. Would go as far to say that it didn't seem to even understand it or what it was about. Having said that, have always believed in judging an adaptation on its own terms, there have been numerous instances of a film or TV series to be not so good as adaptations but good to classic on their own. 'Death Note' manages to be a failure on its own.Does 'Death Note' have good things? Not many but they are there. There are some creative visuals and touches, this is not a cheap-looking film on the most part by all means and often quite striking. The (incidental) music is suitably moody.There is also Willem Dafoe who brings menace and gravitas to Ryuk (although the character is nowhere near sadistic enough and that is the fault of the writers not Dafoe, who was giving his all to what he was given), managing to make a memorable impression despite far too little screen time. His performance comes off best of the cast and the only good one.Found the rest of the acting however to be bland and forced, nobody gets deep into their characters and most don't even seem to understand them. The characters have lost their complexity and substance, they are all stereotypical clichés with no substance or even worse distorted beyond recognition. Complete with far too much emphasis on teen drama that was not really needed and was really not well written (cheesy, shallow and predictable). With more of a psychological drama focus there would have been far more depth and atmosphere and the characters would have been far more interesting.Early on and sadly throughout, suspense and mystery are lacking and as said the characters are bland and often behave irrationally and out of character to an irritating degree. The dialogue is very stilted and the direction lacking control or tautness, didn't get the sense they were at ease or even they wanted to do it. The editing tended to be nauseating, but it's the story treatment that's most disappointing. It's not just the lack of suspense and surprises, it also feels dumbed down and too tame, anything that made one shocked or biting nails were treated with indifference, and events are far too rushed to the point that parts are incoherent. With nothing to the story or characters, the 'Death Note' manages to also be dull due to not being invested in it.Overall, a few saving graces but a mess on the whole. 3/10 Bethany Cox"
sebastian-g-brewer,Absolute garbage and typical Hollywood adaptation,01/10,25-Aug-17,"First time ever writing a review here. Had to do it now because I don't want people like me who enjoyed the original anime/manga to waste their time on this movie. Firstly i didn't know this was a movie until it was released on Netflix. I'm not going into detail, but there is a reason its a long manga/anime and not a movie.Anyway, the protagonist isn't interesting, L is not interesting and the plot is garbage. They took all the good thing from the original and butchered it and made another bad American adaptation.Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed.Save yourself the misery and never watch this.

ramoncarrasquel,The only thing that shares with the source material is the title,01/10,26-Aug-17,"Warning: long review ahead, I don't usually do this but this time I wanted to express myselfI understand that adaptations have to change some things from the source material in order to work in a full length feature film. However most of the changes in Death Note 2017 were so drastic and so unnecessary that it feels like I'm watching another movie, it removes everything that made the original great and instead replaces it with American clichés and tropes that nobody asked for.The biggest change was in the characters, especially with the main character Light Yagami, or in this case Light Turner. The original Light was a character with a sense of morality that he thought he was always doing the right thing, in order to create a New World with no crime and then claim himself as the God of this New World in which he would judge every person if they deserved to die or not. He was a prodigy, the smartest kid in his class, he made always the best decisions in order to execute his plans, he was always decided and he eliminated everyone who got in his way, he was basically perfect, and that what makes him an interesting character, not only that, but also when he showed us he was a complete psychopath and a total maniac.Netflix Light on the other hand is the exact opposite, he was a normal teenager with no charisma, who always questions himself, always makes dumb decisions, and was really unlikable, he pretty much sucked as a protagonist, and was pretty annoying.Doesn't help that the guy playing him did a terrible performance, I have nothing against Nate Wolff, but he pretty much sucked in this movie.You could argue that the change was made for a more ""realistic"" take on Death Note, but doesn't matter in the end because the guy they went with was pretty much unbearable to watch, also I want to ask you a question, what would you rather watch, a show about a smart guy killing criminals while being chased by the best detective in the world or a 1 hour movie with a dumb teenager who doesn't know how to use the Death Note?Speaking of L, I think his character was really weird in this movie, at first he kinda resembled the original L, with his quirks and the way he talks, but halfway trough the movie he completely changes after Watari is gone, he start to act like a complete different character that the movie already setup.Ryuk was kinda OK I guess, Willem Dafoe was great but the way the character was written makes him look pretty different, when in the original he was pretty much the viewer who only saw Light's actions to entertain himself, while in here he pretty much manipulates Light to use the Death Note in the first place.Mia was probably the worst character in the film (besides Light), and it's not because she was completely different from Misa (since I never really liked Misa) but it's because she is basically Kira, when in reality Light should be Kira, she was the one who manipulated Light trough out the whole movie, and she was pretty much the one who did Kira's actions. Not only that she wasn't really likable either, she's pretty much your typical bad-ass female character, that doesn't obey the rules and does pretty much what she wants. The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable.The story was awful, it was pretty much a mess from start to finish, Light gets the notebook an doesn't know how to use it properly, so he shows it to the girl that he likes for some reason, he later to starts killing criminals just because his mother was killed by one, and then L shows up, and doesn't do too much on the investigation, so when he came to the conclusion that Light was Kira it felt rushed and made no sense.The romance in this movie was pretty much what ruined it for me, why would you add romance to Death Note? this is a psychological thriller, not a stupid teenage movie.The climax of this movie also felt pretty rushed and was executed so bad, that it pretty much can confuse anyone, the last minutes of the film were the only thing that kinda resembled Death Note and the story ends with a cliffhanger so that we could get a sequel.The pacing was atrocious, since they tried to include so much in so little time, and the editing was terrible too, with it's constant use of slow-motion for absolutely no reason, and the music selection was awfulThe only thing that could have saved this movie was if it focused on the cat and mouse game between Light and L, since that what made the original interesting in the first place, but instead we focus on a shitty romance sub-plot and cringe dialogue.Even as it's own thing it is still pretty bad, if you haven't seen the anime or read the manga, and you go to see this movie with no expectations, you still gonna be disappointed, since it has terrible characters, plot, editing, and dialogueTL;DR: This movie was a mess, it fails both as an adaptation and as it's own thing, with terrible characters, badly written dialogue, bad acting, horror movie clichés, and a overall a lack of misunderstanding of what a makes a good film in the first place.I would recommend reading the manga or watch the anime since they are so much better than this."
mariusar,Superfans forget: not everyone in the world knows the source material. Rate the film as a film instead....,07/10,11-Nov-19,"I had no idea this was based on anything. Sure, I know Akira, Ghost In The Shell, Hellsing, Battle Royale and maybe a few others, but that's about the extent of my manga/anime knowledge. And as popular as manga/anime has become in the West, it is still a niche genre. Them's the facts.If those superfans are able to step back out of their extreme partisanship, they would find a slick, competently produced, directed, shot and acted piece of cinema. Production values are quite high overall and the acting, while far from Shawshank, is also not abysmal by any means.Trust me, I have seen a lot of abysmal acting in films.Willem DaFoe's voiceover was terrific and I personally found the character of ""L"" pretty interesting.All the 1 ratings are completely out of place for this film if one solely judges it as a standalone piece of cinema. And of course with a healthy does of suspension of disbelief, which given the actual source material is a complete must anyway. It can be argued that the MCU (and the DCU for that matter) has done much the same thing with their adaptations so what's the huge problem here?Rather, a 5-7 star rating for this film as a standalone film would be far more appropriate. Honestly."
kosmasp,Lose(ly),06/10,16-Oct-17,"I get the hate and anger directed at this. If you saw the Manga or even the two life action movies you may feel very disappointed with this. Though let's keep in mind that the spin-off ""L"" movie was disappointing as well (especially considering how rich that character is). So this does not keep track or even copies everything one to one from it's Japanese source material.But again let's keep it real, if it had, there would be outcry, that this is unnecessary, because we already have that in Japan. So it's a lose-lose when it comes to that particular argument. But for newcomers, people not aware of the Japanese origin, this may be a way in. It hopefully draws attention to the source and they'll check it out. Does this adaptation have flaws? Yes it does. And the lead is a bit out of place ... but L is played phenomenally and there are a couple of other nice things in this too (Willem Dafoe to name another one). So while not perfect, this can be entertaining (the idea alone is easy to exploit I reckon), if you let it ..."
aarongnr,"An awful new interpretation of ""Death Note""",02/10,25-Aug-17,"This is the first review I am writing here on IMDb, but this movie is worth it.I have just recently watched the original series ""Death Note"" and, even though it was getting worse and worse with every episode of season 2 (in my opinion), I still thoroughly enjoyed it. There was a huge ton of thought behind every episode, the authors knew exactly which road they wanted to go and it was just really brilliant to watch at times.This version of what has become a classic in the anime genre by now goes a completely different path. Whereas the original names have also been used here (more or less, a little bit amaricanized), the characters lack character on all ends. Of course one could say this is a ""new approach"" to it, and I sure am a fan of new approaches, but this version just misses all the brilliancy and wit of the original series. Light ""Turner"" is supposed to be this smart guy who knows every of his opponents steps beforehand and always knows how to handle each and every situation, but nothing of really a thing in this movie. All he does is do homework for his classmates and be scared about getting caught. L is even worse than Light. Somehow he just magically knows that Light must be Kira just because he didn't kill his father. So what?The script is just very poor and you can see how little effort was put into this every second of it. The acting wasn't too brilliant either.If you just want something fun to watch and pass the time, this is definitely an option. But it's a very poor followup to a good anime show."
xamtaro,Like Donnie Darko mixed with Final Destination,07/10,01-Sep-19,"DEATHNOTE, the popular manga series gets its obligatory Hollywood remake. While taking liberties with the source material, it works less like a faithful adaptation and more like a alternate universe scenario of ""what if a book that is able to exert supernatural control over anyone whose name is written in it, leading up to their deaths, ends up with a typical American teenager?"".Light Turner is that teenager. He is the bullied loner from a broken family, the under appreciated smart kid sitting by himself in the corner. The law has failed to bring his mother's killer to justice, the education system has failed to punish those that pick on him daily, all around him Light is faced with a world of injustice. Enter the death god Ryuk (an immaculately rendered CGI creation with performance by William Defoe) and the titular Deathnote. Ryuk is the devil on Light's shoulder tempting him to use the power of the Deathnote for selfish means.It sets up a familiar tragedy of a young person pushed to the edge by unfairness, given the power to change things, and who ultimately abuses said power to take his anger out on the world. This is the familiar stereotype of school shooting perpetrators as sensationalized by the media and Light is set up specifically as such a character. The performances by Nat Wolff (Paper Towns) as Light and Shea Whigham (Boardwalk Empire) as his father help sell Light's plight and set up his expected eventual fall.However, director Adam Wingard tastefully plays with and eventually subverts this expectation. Though Light does test out the deathnote's power against the aforementioned bully, and uses it again to send his mother's murderer to a nasty gruesome end, he ultimately tries to reject Ryuk's temptation of absolute power over others' fates. It isn't the idealistic ""with great power comes great responsibility"" shtick of superhero comic books but neither is it the nihilistic trope of absolute power's corrupting influence. This middle ground makes Light more relatable and is a much appreciated deviation from the source material. Where Light Yagami of the manga and the Japanese Deathnote movie was this cold, haughty sociopath with a god complex, Turner, in all his social awkwardness, genuinely regrets his decisions to use the Deathnote, with much of the movie being about him trying to avoid being found out, making the wrong choices as any teen in a panic would, and ultimately escalating the situation by mistake.But things aren't so straightforward. Into Light's life comes manipulative girlfriend Mia Sutton who's ambitions for the Deathnote extend beyond just simple payback. Under Mia's influence, Light starts killing any suspected criminal based on the news. They create the persona of ""Kira"", Japanese mispronunciation of ""killer"", to divert police suspicion. Kira's supernatural killing of criminals splits the world; while unlawful many support what they see as justice in an unjust world. Complicating the matter further is when Light's policeman father gets involved in the investigations into the killings, and a mysterious super genius detective named L takes on the case.Now this second half when L comes along is where things get shaky. I get the sense that on one hand we have this deeply personal look at the birth of a sociopath and subsequent subversion of said villain's journey by focusing on Light himself, yet on the other hand we are tied down to the plot beats of the original manga. That means a Kira cult, a convoluted cat and mouse game between L and Light, new rules for the Deathnote, memory loss as a means to be absolved from all suspicions, etc. The generally over the top nature of the original manga just does not match the more grounded ""Everyman"" tale in the movie.While Light's dilemma of trying to shake off Mia's manipulations, evade capture, and plan an outrageous series of events to get away scot free is thrilling and tightly plotted, the movie takes a weird tangent to explore L's origin. L, played by Lakeith Stanfield (Get Out), is amazing. His demeanor, body language, everything is right out of the original manga. How he slowly loses it after being outsmarted time and again by Light is also well done. But the whole tangent storyline to explore his origin may have been better left to a spinoff.One thing that got lost in the translation was that the original source material brings up philosophical and moral dilemmas, questioning the rights and wrongs of its characters' actions. This movie focuses squarely on Light and his own struggles with the escalating situation he finds himself in. This makes the movie less deep than its Japanese counterparts.Despite its ups and downs, I enjoyed DEATH NOTE. Like a combination of Donnie Darko and Final Destination, DEATH NOTE is suitably suspenseful, well cast, and boasts great shots courtesy of Adam Wingard making this low budget movie look much better than it ought to. Combined with the music and the cinematography, this is a loving tribute to 80s and early 90s teen horror movies with both the pros and the cons of what that entails."
antoniokowatsch,Good if you haven't seen the anime yet,06/10,01-Sep-17,"Disclaimer: it is pretty obvious that the anime is far better than this movie. It is arguably one of the best animes/mangas ever written. But this movie isn't actually as bad as many people make it out to be either. So just keep that in mind.Once you realize that this movie was supposed to be a different take on the whole Death Note story it is actually quite enjoyable. Yes, many of the characters from the anime are missing in the movie. But that was to be expected. It would've been impossible to incorporate all of them into a movie of this length.I think that all the die-hard Death Note fanatics need to suspend their disbelief and just accept that this movie wasn't intended for them. None of these live action movies are. I have seen dozens of them and every single time people complain that it wasn't canon or too simplified. As if it's actually possible to comprise an entire series into a movie. Give me a break.About the cast; some of the performances were really solid. L's acting e.g.. I can see how some people complained about the ""whitewashing"" but I think that they just don't get it. There is already a Japanese live action movie about this anime with an all- Asian cast. This is supposed to be a more Western approach to the story hence the white cast. I think people need to respect the vision of the director on this one."
thajose,"Entertaining, I Enjoyed This.",08/10,08-Sep-17,"First off, I have not read the original source material manga for this. Right off the bat, I realize this will infuriate people, as the vast majority of comments on here destroy this movie because of the heavy deviation from the manga. I get that, I typically enjoy a book far more than the film adaptation. However, this review is strictly about the merits of the movie, not how it stands up against the original. Knowing nothing of the manga, I really enjoyed this movie. The concept was unfamiliar to me, and I found the characters and plot interesting. I realize if I ever read the source material (which I may, as I enjoyed this so much), I might join the chorus of angry voices who think the movie should have followed the source more closely. Today, having just watched the movie, I liked it a lot. Again, I get why people who are fans of the original are hating on this so much. Those of us who actually grew up reading ""Iron Man"" hated the slaughter that was Iron Man 3 (seriously, that is what you are going to do with The Mandarin, arguably Iron Man's most ruthless and deadly enemy?), but the rest of the world, who had no clue about the original comics loved it. So, maybe this is my ""Iron Man 3."" But ignorance is bliss, so I enjoyed Death Note a lot."
FrenchEddieFelson,Clearly underrated,06/10,07-Mar-19,"The other reviews are massively not enthusiastic: Even though I'm a huge fan of the eponymous manga, it seems like most of the other fans are disappointed, as a sweet euphemism, by this adaptation. Turning a 10-hours Japanese cartoon into a 90-minutes Hollywood movie is obviously a tough exercise. But, according to me, the result is nevertheless correct. Morality: movie to be watched, and eventually appreciated, BEFORE the manga.

ridudec,Worst production of Netflix,01/10,25-Aug-17,"This is hands down the worst production of Netflix so far. They took the concept from the source material but turned it everything opposite and awful acting, script. characterization were final nail in the coffin. This show had nothing to offer. Boring as soon as it started and got worse with the course of time. This movie's existence is a mystery that's all

blitzkrieg-79640,Why all the hate for this film?,07/10,11-Jul-19,"I've been around a fair few dacades and watched a lot of movies - among them horror, dark fantasy, and so on. Not sure why this one has so many negative reviews - possibly based on the original anime (which I admittedly have never watched).Even so, I went in with an open mind and zero expectations and I really enjoyed it. The acting was sound, as was the the story, effects, continuity and so on. Yes there were a few times when I spotted a minor error but so what? It was entertaining and enjoyable, without too much gratuitous gore.If you have nothing else to watch and need something to do with an hour and a bit, I'd recommend Death Note.

zombiefan89,It's not that bad.,08/10,01-Sep-17,"It's actually not that bad! There are points that really push the boundaries what the Death Note is really capable of, but I'll be honest, I liked the movie! I think it will broaden Death Note's audience in the west! As far as character development, it does okay for a movie. Ryuk is the best part by far, but Light is fairly likable too. Mia is WAY better in this movie than she ever was in the manga or anime! People going into this from the anime and manga are going to be disappointed as they were when watching those goofy live action Death Note movies from Japan! You can't fit a full length anime or manga series into a single movie, but you can tell they really tried with this movie! They cast William Dafoe, whose Green Goblin portrayal inspired the original Ryuk in the manga! Yeah, a lot of love and passion went into this movie!"
barrelhousegutboy,Don't watch the anime first!,07/10,29-Aug-17,"As a big fan of the anime I was cringing a little before watching; taking the attitude of I hope they don't screw it up too bad. The first thing I came to realize is they weren't trying to recreate the anime. While the idea and principal characters are represented and the story line follows the same direction, the entire focus of the movie is different. So for this reason I would advise against seeing the anime if you haven't already as this is more a cliff notes version with some major changes. Okay the bad- the movie is just too short, really needed another 30-40 minutes to delve into the scope of the Death Note and the creation of Kira. Ryuk gets almost no attention and basically spends his time laughing, and the half eaten apples started to bug me (just why a death god eats at all is never explained). Now the good- despite the above deficiencies it had no trouble keeping my attention for the most part. The deaths they show are adequately graphic. The notion that Light is making the world a better place is buttressed by interaction from other players, not just declared like some other elements. Overall I think this movie is aimed at the Goosebumps demographic who have just grown past that franchise. It presents a thought provoking scenario both wondrous and horrifying, sprinkle it with gore and tension, and top it off with 'hey I could be that guy'. The movie concludes leaving some questions unanswered and primed for a sequel. So my conclusion is if you have never heard of Death Note before and were a fan of Goosebumps then definitely give this a viewing. However if you are a purist and have seen the anime you may want to steer clear. Personally I liked it despite its shortcomings and will probably watch it again."
itzalep,Do not watch,02/10,25-Aug-17,"I don't suggest you watch the movie if you are a huge fan of Death Note, because it will ruin the whole thing. The actors and actresses were terrible and just everything was a big disappointment. The movie had almost nothing to do with the anime. If you have never heard of Death Note before, watch the anime first and if you are curious to watch the movie, go ahead..But as I said before, you will be disappointed.

johnplocar,"Written before knowing the fan consensus on the movie. Fans will hate this adaption, everyone else will be fine probably.",07/10,24-Sep-17,"It's been a while since I've really written about a movie and I just feel in the mood for it today to talk a little bit about what I just saw today. Freshly released onto Netflix, the live-action adaption of ""Death Note"". Directed by the man behind ""You're Next"", ""The Guest"" and last year's ""Blair Witch""; Adam Wingard. The story centers a high school boy named Light Turner, who comes across a mysterious book titled the Death Note. Attached to this book is a demon by the name of Ryuk, played terrifically by Willem Dafoe. Ryuk informs Light that the book has the power to kill anyone who's name is written inside. From there things only become more and more intense for the lead as the police and a very clever detective using the pseudonym 'L' begin hunting him down. But along the way he also becomes fairly close to his school crush, Mia Sutton, only to complicate things even more.I will begin this by saying, no. No, I have not read any of the mangas. No, I have not watched any of the anime. No, I am probably not the intended demographic for this movie. Yes, I did enjoy the movie regardless of all that. I thought that this was a solid movie, honestly perfect type of movie to be directly viewed through streaming rather than put on the big screen. It was about an hour and 40 minute flick that flew by rather fluidly with its brisk pacing. Even though the characters aren't fully fleshed out by any means, they are still engaging enough to carry me through the plot. The film itself is really good looking, I mean fantastically well made in terms of its camera work, lighting and certainly the special effects. The filmmakers have done what a lot of films have been doing lately, doing a cross between practical effects interwoven with touches of CGI and they do a good job blending the two together. I would say that this is probably Wingard's best looking film thus far in his career.In terms of some negatives I have, like I said before, the characters aren't all that 3-dimensional but they aren't badly written either so I can look passed that. The movie starts to ask questions very briefly about whether its right or not for one person to decide who should die. But it never gets close to actually diving into the ideas of that. How killing people who are supposedly guilty of crimes may truly be just as wrong, or maybe if these people actually aren't guilty and our lead could be making a mistake. Even going into whether they're guilty or not, how it effects the people who knew the Death Note victims. Again, does not get into anything like that. Rather it steers away from that to make sure the viewer doesn't have enough time to ask such questions; which has its pros and cons to keeping such a quick pace to the story. Yes, we focus much more on what's going on with our protagonist avoiding the police, dealing with the demon, developing a relationship with the girl or what have you but it's still avoiding going into some places with the story that could have been interesting and even somewhat philosophical. Anyways, not really a major issue, just something that came to mind a little bit. Another slight problem I had was that some character arcs seemed to jump a little bit in an unnatural progression, not by a whole lot but was certainly noticeable when it happened.Overall, I say it's an entertaining little flick with enough going on to keep one along for the seemingly short ride. If you are a fan of the manga or anime, I truly have no idea what you may think about this movie. I am kind of curious to know how faithful an adaptation this is to its source material and if it compares well. However, as an outsider, I think that the movie is worth a watch and has enough in it to enjoy. It is a stylish film with decent ideas, a solid story with likable characters that contains enough intrigue and suspense to carry itself with no problem."
napaxo,It's bad and you know it,02/10,26-Aug-17,"When someone writes a negative review about a movie and that review is the only one he has ever written,you know that it's bad. So where to begin,OK first of all I've seen the anime and never read the manga , but that didn't stop me from appreciating the character development and mind games the series had to offer. When i saw that it was being made into a movie and knowing Hollywood's tendency to butcher source materials beyond recognition, i was quite skeptical. Well as it happens my fears were well justified because this movie is a mess. Light is a teenager with psychological problems due to his mothers death , he's doing other peoples homework for money and he is caring for someone else enough to get beaten down by the school bullies and all this in just the first seven minutes of the movie.If you think that this isn't the calculating, megalomaniac, mastermind antihero with a God complex that's Light,well you're right he isn't and you don't get more politically correct by casting the hero, L ,as black. Anyway i could go on and on about how the movie was immature and failed to capture the intensity and spark of the original but i want to keep this short. I give it a 2/10 and that's only because of Lights frightened schoolgirl screams when he meets Ryuk for the first time. I couldn't stop laughing and for that alone it gets an extra point."
awakeandaware-22008,The Death of Death Note,01/10,25-Aug-17,"If you liked the Death Note anime or live action series, you will not like this.If you didn't like the Death Note anime or live action series, then there's a good chance you may like this.Death Note is not meant to be turned into a movie, as the Japanese movies prove.

vicentenog,It should have been a TV Series,06/10,25-Aug-17,"An unfortunate missed opportunity. I didn't give this movie a 5 because it was different from the original, i thought it wasn't different enough. I have read the Death Note manga several times and i think that, for a Shonen Jump Manga, it is a Masterpiece.Still, being a Manga made for a very specific demographic it is tied to several silly Japanese teen archetypes. For example: Light Yagami being a High School Student and Misa Amane being a Teen idol, both of them being Japanese, that kind of thing. The Story of a NoteBook of Death that is used to ""create a better world"" however, has a potential that far exceeds the original manga. I believe that, had this been done correctly, it could have been on par with Breaking Bad. It could have been a master piece. They didn't even have to use the names of the original characters, they could have forgotten about the silly high school plot line and the Japanese clichés.It should have been a TV Series and the characters should have been Detectives. Its sad to see such missed potential. I honestly believe that, had this been done by good writers and on the right format, it could have far surpassed the original."
ledee_anthony,Did they understand why people loved Death note ?,02/10,25-Aug-17,"First, I don't care about the whitewashing, or the shinigami lore... Death note was not great because it was set in Japan but because those who made the manga did an intense thriller with some great philosophical point !In the manga Light is an brilliant young man, with an opportunity to change the world and a desire to maintain a legacy and not get caught. We got a strong moral code and think that he is in the right ! Well, this new Light didn't planned anything ahead (expect the god awful deus ex machina at the end...), has a boring cliché teenage angst, kills people because that seems a thrilling thing to do with his girlfriend (more on her in a second), decides to stop at the first sign of trouble, and is incapable of being active but only reacts to things happening to him. He didn't even seems to think that the police might try to catch him.The girlfriend (not in the source material, and it's easy to know why). Well, she doesn't have any kind of personality. she seems to live on instinct, with no moral code whatsoever. why it doesn't work ? Because she's supposed to be a part of Light, that made Light doubt and hesitate ! Now we have TWO empty main characters instead of one full-fledged brilliant one.The narration, I know, I know, American critics find that lazy, cinemasins sins it, and most of the time narration is the worst... MOST OF THE TIME. In death note, narration is Light internal monologue, which is essential to understand this complex character who tries to be ahead of everything. It's the source of the tension in the anime and they took that away. Narration in Mr Robot is great ! It's possible you see !Because of that, everything else falls apart, Ruyk isn't the big corrupting menace that Pollutes Light's moral code, he is just monster-scary.. and L, seems smarter then Light at every turn, (the dinner scene is the most revealing, did someone understand the complexity of both arguments ? )... instead of a brilliant cat-and-mouse we got a pair of teenagers way over their heads who tries to make-up a plan to escape from the police ! American adaptation don't have to dumb down every plot to an Halloween special of CSI !!!And to my summary, why call the movie death note when you don't even understand the soul of the source material ? Lingering ""why ?"" Thoughts : - the over-complicated weirdly irrelevant rules of the death note - L zero-in on Light the dumbest way possible (really ? the father on a press conference) - L knows exactly that the team has been compromised but didn't think to plan something to avoid that outcome - the useless love-story - the acting - the relationship between father and son Why not make it as a series that could encompass the complexity of each character instead of a trainwreck of a movie ?"
nickshenoda,ghost in a shell looks much better now,02/10,26-Aug-17,"firstly with the good aspects of the movie. the acting isn't brilliant but it's still good. ryuk is more sinister than he is in the anime which is a plus for me. mia (misa originally) isn't annoying at all, in fact she is more light like than light himself i.e the anime's light. the movie progresses at an incredible pace which could be a good or bad thing depending on the viewer, I personally like it when movies move their plot quick. and finally there's an AHS reference in there so thats a big plus.now. despite all the above mentioned things this movie fails so bad it's almost tragic. why? because the story is rubbish and there isn't nearly enough depth to the characters as there was in the show. there light had a god complex that was almost palpable. we saw the turmoil that light went through after claiming his first victims and his reasoning and justification of it to himself. and it is not a matter of time available. the show established all that in the very first episode, go watch it. but in the movie light is made into a victim with daddy issues. he kills because his mom was killed and he doesn't want others to be as helpless as he was. sure the line about giving people a god is thrown in there but u can never actually feel it. and there are many plot holes in the story. if mia wanted the death note to herself why did she give it back to light in the first place!?. why does L reveal his face to light? if watari is so close to L why isn't his true identity also a mystery like it was in the anime?, light literally learned about watari through the internet.but the biggest flaw of this movie is that it fails to sell on the intelligence of both Light and L. it is very hard to believe L to be the best detective in the world if he couldn't even figure out that if watari is under kira's control and I've just revealed my face to him than he's probably using watari to learn my true name and hence watari has gone to my old orphanage. and light didn't think to hide death note despite knowing that he was a suspect. he was lucky mia sneaked it out when they searched his house. and seriously L didn't think to search his only suspects girlfriend while she was in the house. she could be sneaking out the very thing you are looking for. which she actually did."
maxnexus-97144,I enjoyed it!,08/10,01-Sep-17,"It was a good movie, I found it to be very stimulating with a fine plot.I am surprised it has not been given the recognition it deserves. Although I have not seen the original as some reviewers have pointed. It certainly is not a 1 star movie as many users have suggested!!! Far from it, let's be fair!Good use of music and soundtracks throughout the movie,an added bonus. I really enjoyed it.

BJG-Reviews,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),08/10,27-Jan-19,"The stage curtains open ...First, I'm not going to sit here and compare the source material to this latest film. As is the case with most Americanized movies of this genre type (ie: ""Grudge"", ""The Ring"", ""Shutter"" ... etc), it is going to be different. It always is, so bellyaching and complaining about it won't mean a thing. I've learned to just react to what the movie is and not what I think it should be.""Death Note"" wastes no time in getting things in motion starting off with Light Turner (Nat Wolff) receiving the death note book on a rainy, Seattle day. Opening and reading the first few pages, he is introduced to Ryuk (voiced nicely by Willem Dafoe) - a god of death and executionist who is held to and empowered by the book. Ryuk informs Light that he simply needs to write a person's name in the book while seeing their face in his mind, and that person will die. Seeing firsthand what it can do, he confides in a girl he is infatuated with, Mia (Margaret Qualley), and together they create their own god of justice, Kira - killing off, vigilante style, everyone they feel is deserving. Soon, all trails begin to lead to Light as a possible suspect and that's when it really gets interesting.I enjoyed this movie. It moves along at a fast pace, but not overly so - keeping you glued to the screen. The story also moves right along, which I liked. There are absolutely no dull moments in the film. The relationship between Light and Mia was very well developed, completely believable - as well as the relationship between Light and his father. I felt everyone was perfectly cast, and the acting was solid.This was a well executed story with pacing that flows nicely. I would watch this again and am looking forward to the sequel they already have planned for it. And for the source material? That is another review for another time. But as for THIS movie, it's a recommend."
Matt-Canalcon,"Entertaining, but not exactly what the fans might be looking for...",06/10,25-Aug-17,"I want to preface by saying that this movie was my introduction to Death Note, my friends were big fans of the original material so I knew what it was about but I never read the manga or watch the anime. I understand they are also not very interested in this film, anyway the movie just launched on Netflix so I watched it. I thought Adam Wingard overall did a good job, it's not a great movie by any means, but I thought it was well-directed and entertaining, even though it's also largely flawed. The biggest problem with this film might be the tonal changes and the pacing, the movie had trouble finding its voice and is trying to move to fast. There was moments of horror, followed by a quick comic relief and then serious conversations. Tonally, I have to admit it was a little bit all over the place. The performance by Nat Wolff was uneven for me, part of it was great, for example, no spoilers, but there's a scene with his father at the beginning where I thought he was nailing it, but I'm not sure I was into all the screaming and over-the-top reactions, which goes back to the problem with the tone of the film. The script is also messy and might be the sole reason why this movie did not exactly land. Regarding Ryuk, Willem Dafoe did a nice job voicing him, but I guess I was hoping to get more of his flavor into the character, the effects on Ryuk looked great in the shadows, but sometimes he's sitting on a bed clearly and you can notice some imperfections, but that might only be me because he was definitely a strong part of this adaptation. I'm curious what the fans of the original thought of Ryuk in this movie, because I get the feeling that overall most of them might be disappointed. Yes the script is problematic but, Wingard knows how to direct a movie, loved the visuals, the soundtrack, it was interesting and I slightly enjoyed it. 6/10"
onze-kris,totally waste of twme. watch the series,01/10,27-Aug-17,"I watched the series in a single weekend. it was clever, engaging and an easy recommendation even to people who are not into manga. So i watched this with high hopes and i was crushed by the poor performance all around. Not just by the actors but the script and some unnecessary special effects as well. It turns this in in a c movie.This is the worst movie i hopefully see this decade. I stayed until the end because the series was so good. but truth be told the opening credits of the series are way better than all the good moments in this piece of crap.

ashesdyybuk,Destination Twilight,01/10,25-Aug-17,"This movie was awful. It was like I was watching a mix between Twilight and Final Destination. Being a fan of the anime series I was skeptical about watching the film, but decided to go through with it anyways. There are so many things wrong with the movie that just stray away from the anime/manga entirely: 1.) Misa or as they call her in the movie ""Mia"" was more obsessed with the death note than Light and ultimately chose the death note over him. 2.) Light was an emo, who got bullied. Not a ""perfect"" person who viewed himself as a god. 3.) L was too emotional, jumped to conclusions, violent and just overall off-putting (not in the way he should have been) 4.) ""Mia"" is able to write in the death note, touch the death note, yet she is still unable to see Ryuk. Now I could go on and on about the way in which this movie has incorrectly represented death note, but if we separate the anime from this movie then we still have a horrible film. The actors were god awful, I couldn't tell if the movie was being satirical or serious half the time. The CGI was not good. Things just felt over the top and goofy most of the time. The characters were not likable what-so-ever, just whiny teenagers who were mad at the world. Overall this film gets a 1/10 from me; if I could give negative stars I would. To those of you who want to spare yourself, don't watch this movie."
louiethepitt,this movie was the worst Fan Fiction,02/10,26-Aug-17,"yep...this movie was made as fan fiction and not an adaptation...forget about the different country and names and races... this movie adapts nothing from the original Death note....the characters are not the Death note characters and share non of the traits...the movie moves completely off from the original Story...you can say this only shares with Death note...the name, The Book, the Demon and that is mostly it... horrible fan-fiction....if this was an adaptation it was horrible executed, if this was an alternative take on Death Note which it was...then is a poor take on a very good Story...it didn't add anything and it was inferior...why make an inferior product...why not make the original then?

a_sad_cow,"Inferior to the original, but perfect to share with someone with a fear of anime",08/10,10-Sep-17,"We watched this because I was curious and my SO doesn't want to try anime yet, so a nice compromise for the night. If the premise is even vaguely interesting, just go watch the original first. If someone in your audience is anti-anime, well, here you go.They changed up the plot significantly, but it wasn't all bad. Light still had a worldly view, L was played rather fantastically, and there were some great shots. I was not a fan of the soundtrack, but my anti-anime SO thought it was fantastic, so I'm willing to give it some credit at hitting its target audience.They did leave a couple cliffhangers, guessing hoping for a sequel. With all the hate from the fans of the original, I'm guessing it won't happen.

xacebop-09424,"I went into this movie unbiased, but was ultimately disappointed (spoilers)",02/10,25-Aug-17,"Death Note is my favorite anime of all time, even still watching it annually despite having outgrown the phase. It is one of the most original ideas that you rarely see anymore and was allowed to breathe due to it's long run time of 50+ episodes. The characters were highly developed, you felt an attachment to Kira despite their sadistic and murderous nature. There was actual development, from the FBI agent Raye Penbar, and his wife, to Misa, whose plot line was absurdly absent from the movie.When I first heard about the American remake I knew it was going to be literally impossible to hold up to the original because it was being made as a film. It just cannot be done. There is too much depth to the story that would inevitably have to be ignored. I was willing to leave that aside though due to Netflix's stellar reputation, but may in the future have to reconsider what they are capable of.Light was horrendous, plain and simple. He did not come off as intelligent at all, and the only sliver we see of that was literally the last scene of the film, and even then, it was disappointing. The cat and mouse game we knew and loved was expedited and mostly ignored in an attempt to cram everything together in under two hours.Mia, his girlfriend just seemed completely unnecessary. She was involved right out of the gates, which was just foolish. So much for an ""intelligent"" protagonist. Furthermore, she was unable to see Ryuk, which could have easily been added and could have at least helped the plot a little. No sympathy whatsoever for the character, who turned out to be the real antagonist.L. The reason I am giving this film a star at all. The actor, with what little screen time he had and despite my reservations about his race actually captured a lot of the neuroses about L. With all of the things they managed to leave out I was surprised to see that they nailed his posture, and sitting, among other things.Ryuk, I felt Defoe was really the saving grace of this film and the only real reason I was able to sit through it. While it wasn't near his best role, he did a great job with the horrible script that was available to him.The entire story moves along way too fast, there is no development, no cat and mouse, no explanation as to how L was able to isolate and track Kira which was a central plot of the anime (putting out localized stories in every era and seeing who Kira kills). There was also no character with death eyes, or even multiple death gods. I was disappointed when there was no backstory behind Ryuk, where he came from, the other death gods and their gambling etc.In summary, one point for L, one point for Ryuk, everything else was a disgrace and shame to the original. While I understand the limitations present in having this made with the restraints of a film, I thought almost everything could have been better adapted. I am thoroughly disappointed with Netflix for ever picking this up. They could have made an amazing series out of this, (EVERYTHING IS ALREADY SPELLED OUT FOR YOU IN THE MANGA/ANIME) but chose to do a film instead, big mistake. Netflix's resources could have been better spent bringing back Firefly or any number of shows rather than waste their time on ruining a great masterpiece.This film really has no place, as it is not appealing and entertaining to average viewers, and is a slap in the face to fans of the original. Do yourself a favor and skip this altogether if you haven't already watched it."
thorjelly,God help me but I actually liked it.,07/10,01-Sep-17,"First of all, it's not like the original. At all, really. I felt like with a rewrite, it'd have made more sense to just make it an original story with new characters and names that was set in the Death Note universe. That being said, it is not a legitimate criticism to say it's not like the original. Changing things is fine. Making the story completely different is fine. The question is if it thematically suits the original, and if what was changed works.Well, I think it does. Mostly. It has a lot of the same themes of the original, even if the characters were mostly completely different. It questions the morality of murdering bad people without trial, and demonstrates the fanaticism that can arise with power. The film overall seems to be presented stylistically, moodily, with some nice musical interludes in a Donnie Darko sort of vein. It has a few twists and a pretty nice ending that makes it relatively satisfying, and it doesn't follow a predictable Hollywood format, which makes it at least a bit refreshing. And if you don't believe me that it's thematically similar to the original, the original author and artist of Death Note both praised the film believing it was a good adaption thematically.There were things wrong with it. The pacing wasn't great. It starts off well and then it just shoots off like a rocket, making it hard to follow the second act. It made a pretty big directing faux pas by introducing new characters and concepts right inside a montage. A lot of the dialogue isn't written so well, making characters occasionally sound banal. The Final Destination-esque Rube Goldberg deaths were often overly done and comically gratuitous. I don't think it fits the themes very well to literally laugh when someone gratuitously explodes. You don't need to make huge stretches to be hardcore just because you're on Netflix, guys.Overall I think this is not a film for the fanboys. They're going to hate it because it's different. I feel like I like it mostly because to be honest with you. However, honestly? I found the original to be flawed too. I think it will be an interesting but flawed film for pretty much anyone who doesn't worship the original. It is aesthetically (except for the utterly gratuitous deaths) and thematically pleasing, but has some pacing and writing issues. Hope this review will be helpful."
bastiaan0740,Quite enjoyable.,07/10,12-Mar-20,"Not having seen or read any previous iterations (I have now and they are somewhat better), I found the movie quite enjoyable. Has a definite 'Final Destination' Americanised vibe to it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The monster is more convincing whether you like that or not, Willem Dafoe lends his voice well. Solid concept no matter which version you prefer, and not deserving of the low rating.

Maladjusted_1,Your appreciation of a classic series will suffer if you watch this.,02/10,25-Aug-17,"Have you ever wondered what would happen if you combined Napoleon Dynamite with Final Destination? Me neither, but I think I've found the answer. The first ten minutes of the new Death Note film tell us quite clearly who this film is aimed at. People who like teen dramas but are partial to a little gore may like Adam Wingard's adaptation. The rest of us won't. My hopes for the remaining eighty-or-so minutes were set rather low following a poor opening act, and my downgraded expectations – I'm disappointed to say – were completely justified.The original Death Note had some great characters, but this latest film will probably sour your appreciation of them. What I had in mind when I pictured the Light role was a performance like Rami Malek's in Mr. Robot. Nat Wolff is probably good enough for Paper Towns and similar films, but the character of Light Yagami seems to demand someone of a higher calibre - an actor who's able to convey his character's complexity through expression and convincing delivery.The blame for Light isn't Wolff's alone to bear; much of it belongs to the writers (the creative talents behind the latest Fantastic Four and the mercifully near-forgotten Immortals). In this film, Light is far too embracing of his overnight-demigod status. We don't see any of the inner moral struggles or self-questioning that really defined the character throughout the original story. The writers seem to acknowledge that there should be a dilemma, and in one blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment we hear Light tell his confidant: ""I guess I should feel guilty but don't."" That's it, really; from this point on Light is as ethically two-dimensional as the worst 80s' action villains. Lakeith Stanfield's ""L"" is perhaps even more of a misfire than Wolff's Light. There's really no sincerity in L's lines, or in Stanfield's delivery of them. The actor seems to pay superficial homage to L with some of the character's recognisable mannerisms, but neither Stanfield nor the writers give us much of an indication of L's brilliance. The third major performance in Wingard's Death Note belongs to Margaret Qualley who plays Mia, Light's girlfriend. Her character is arguably the most inexplicable and definitely the most unnecessary. Mia – as indicated by her name – seems to be Wingard's take on Misa Amane. The similarities don't extend much further than the forenames. The supporting characters generally do a passable job, but that's all. You may be questioning my failure to mention one of the main selling points of this film – Willem Dafoe's Ryuk. I've omitted it from my review up to now because there isn't much to say.Fans of the original Death Note may be enticed by the first shots of a discarded apple core, but the iconic shinigami becomes quite a bore as the film progresses. Dafoe is a very good voice actor, but his talents aren't really put to the test here. The rest of it - music, cinematography, editing and the other more technical aspects of the film - are neither good nor bad. Maybe that's quite a boast, as mediocre is as good as it gets in Wingard's Death Note. I can't honestly recommend this to anyone. It's an inferior product in every conceivable way."
gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Rushed and incoherent, Death Note disrespects the source material in any way possible",03/10,12-Jan-18,"A couple of years ago, my brother and I watched a particular anime on Netflix and it was none other than Death Note an anime about a person named Light Yagami who discovers a supernatural book from Ryuk, a Shinigami. The book grants the user's ability to kill any person whose name and face he knows. As for the anime, I realized that since it still has it's fans, it's a well-written show. It centered around not only good and evil, but also the themes about liberty and security. And the characters really grew on you with each having their own solid characterization. So, when we heard that a live-action film based on the anime and manga was coming to Netflix, we were worried that it would end up like the other live-action films based on the cartoons (DBE, TLA, etc.). Turns out it did and when one of the writers that did the screenplay for the critically panned Fantastic Four reboot (Fan4stic) contributed to the writing for this movie, it was a sign that it was going to suck.I'm not going to spoil the film because it's been four months since it came out on Netflix, but there are some problems that made the adaptation as unbearable as you realize if you're a fan of Death Note. The characters in this movie aren't exactly like their counterparts (save for two actors, which we'll get to in a moment). The writing is garbage and does a great disservice to the source material, the pacing is very uneven even for a live-action movie that's like... what? 100 minutes? But what bugged me the most was the changes made for this film. Light, Mia (or in this adaptation, Kia), and the other side characters including L, Light's opponent, aren't as interesting and they lacked the spark that made the anime and manga counterparts much better. Even the music song choices that were chosen for some of the scenes (which I'm not going to spoil) felt out of place.Now, this film is not the worst because there are some highlights. The music score from Atticus Ross and Leopold Ross does excel at the atmosphere. Sure, it's not Oscar-worthy, but at least it's more tolerable than the film itself. The visual designs are really creative and kept up with the tone Death Note was going for and the directing, while not the best, is at least decent. And the last highlight is the acting. Despite the writing and changes being complete garbage, the actors did their best with what they got. Nat Wolff, Lakeith Stanfield, and Margaret Qualley did ok with their roles, but only Shea Whigham and Willem Dafoe did somewhat better jobs because they were at least accurate to their anime counterparts. Sure, Ryuk's character design was made in CGI, but I guess the producers paid attention to the details.Unfortunately, those highlights weren't enough to save this film and given it's reputation, I understand why. And yet, there's a sequel in the works. *sigh*, I haven't seen the live-action Fullmetal Alchemist yet, but at least Japan is trying to do a much better adaptation than what we got here. Overall, if you're a fan of Death Note, both the anime and manga, I suggest you skip this."
john-1451,I must be the only one who loved this movie.,09/10,26-Aug-17,"I rarely post reviews on IMDb, but this time is one of the exceptions. I never read the manga or saw the anime, so maybe that's why I liked this as much as I did. The acting was kind of up and down, but Willem Dafoe as the demon, and the guy who played ""L"", the detective were very good. The thing I liked most was that the plot was unpredictable, with plenty of twists and turns. It started out as a standard ""Teen Revenge"" movie, but goes off in a very different tangent, with the protagonist using his power not just to get revenge, but also to right wrongs. It's when the aforementioned detective begins to close in that things start going badly. The most important thing was that I was never bored, and that almost never happens. Sometimes people give bad reviews to American adaptions of foreign properties - especially Asian properties where the characters are changed to Caucasians - their ""PC"" mentality making them hate it before they even see it. This seems to be the case here.

melodysongfleur,You could rename this movie Final Destination 6 and no one would know,01/10,25-Aug-17,"This is probably the worst TV to Movie adaptation out there, and I watched the Last Airbender. Tried too hard to be edgy and just turned into a Final Destination rip off with bad effects, choppy editing and a death god who looked more like a burn victim. The Charatizarion and motives were all awful and completely wrong and the stupid twists were cheap and predictable. Just do not waste your time.

j_menendez-63289,Worst movie adaption of an anime EVER,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I understand that movies can have different plots and endings than the original anime/book but this one stripped the entire essence of what was so great about Death Note.The characters are not at all how they are in the series. Light was a stud, smart a sociopath genius who could manipulate and outsmart anyone with and unwaiverable goal to be God. L is almost autistic and incredibly smart, not emotional. He was logical and to the point. Mia is a groupie fan girl with Light, a celebrity on her own but never would try to kill unless ordered by Kira to carry out his true goal of being God for as long as possible and destroying everything in his way.The scene were Ryuk appears makes me want to puke it is so bad, his relationship with Light is far from what we see in the series, the plot is plain stupid. IT is mostly about him and his gf fighting whether they took it too far him and him being dumb enough to know his gf didn't take the book and kill some cops. I hate this movie so much and so mad I spent whatever time I spent watching it because it is not worth even 5 minutes. Whoever made this should be ashamed and never produce a movie again."
eboogyman2,You will only like it if you weren't a fan of the anime,09/10,26-Aug-17,"I watched this movie on Netflix and loved it. Thought it was a great story and wanted it to just keep going on and on. Sadly it was over quickly because i wanted more. I jumped on IMDb to find it was based on an Anime series. Everyone who hates it here seems to be a fan and doesn't judge the movie as if it didn't have the anime roots. For that's, its fantastic. Im eager to watch the Anime series and while Im sure Ill get trolled for loving the movie by the anime fans, accept that a new fan was made because of the American version

tazjam,This is why people hate American adaptations of movies,01/10,26-Aug-17,"I will preface this by saying I didn't make it through the whole movie. I got 1 hour in, and that's SOLELY because I enjoyed the anime and the Japanese versions of the live-action movies so much.This was written by 2 guys who've barely had any experience and the same idiot who wrote the terrible Fantastic Four (2015) movie. In other words, 3 people who really don't know what they're doing.Instead of taking the source material and adapting it for the US while leaving most of the story intact, they decided to dumb it down, condense it and throw away pretty much anything that made sense.Instead of Light being the popular, good-looking, brilliant son of a brilliant detective who wanted to help his dad, we get a loner who cheats and a father who is barely noticed. Instead of a super-model/singer girlfriend who is tormented by her own past and becomes enthralled by Kira, we get a girl-next-door average cheerleader who just happens to fall for Light because... reasons.The drama that made the series and movies work so well, where everybody was trying to outsmart each other is stripped away and we're left with more of a soap opera story with no character development, no plot development and the only ""brilliant"" things are ones the screenwriters think they are surprising you with. Except THE AUDIENCE IS NEVER IN ON IT!There are 3 MUCH better movies and a whole anime series to watch instead of this. If you're a fan of the show, you'll HATE this movie. If you've never seen the show... go watch it instead."
gregvsds,More like Death NOT(e),01/10,26-Aug-17,"I normally don't get people that hate on adaptations, but this time, i can understand all the hate this movie gets. It has NOTHING to do with the actual manga or anime and i mean nothing. The characters are not as they should be, the plot is not as it should be, the only thing that looks as it should, well, kinda.. Is Ryuk and he is BARELY used in the film. The film does nothing to set a pace or a tone for the film, and IMO it just assumes you know what's up already. But, even if you know from the anime it still has nothing to do with it. Long story short don't waste your time if you want to watch an ACTUAL adaptation of Death Note, as this ISN'T one. The movie just preys on the name of Death Note and it's a shame. The actual rating i would give is 3/10 for the effort, BUT, i don't wanna help the rating of this movie any further."
djmike-63474,I'm beginning to doubt my taste,07/10,07-Dec-22,"I'm beginning to doubt my taste in movies lol. I always thought I marched to a different drummer, I was a drum major in high school so I guess those people had to follow me. Reading all of the other reviews (ok, yeah yeah I know, there were 1.2k of them, so I didn't read them all, but I read a lot of them) not many are with me now.I thought it had a good pace, decent action, good acting. But dang, come on people, 18,000 plus gave it 1 star. I didn't see the original so I guess I had nothing to be angry about. Find someone, pop sum popcorn, settle in and check this out and let me know what you think. Nuff Said Mike Out.

bartning,"First Time Exposure to Death Note, Good Movie",09/10,26-Sep-17,"I was surprised the movie had such a low rating, and upon review, it seems _Death Note_ has had a dedicated following in its original form from Japan. However, this film's my first exposure to the story. Still, I don't see why there's so much criticism on the movie's making it an Americanized version because it was an American movie and many films get this treatment, especially as remakes of the original, e.g. _The Ring_, _Oldboy_, _Let Me In_, just to name a few. It was an original concept for someone new to the story, and I came in here to see if it will have a squeal as one would be good.

reb-warrior,CW-like crapola teen horror flick.,02/10,02-Sep-17,"The whitewashing was bad enough. Hollywood screams for diversity, but then doesn't cast for it. Yes I know this is the American version. Ever hear of Japanese Americans? At least cast either Light or L as JA. Or just set it in Japan. You may find Americans aren't the neanderthals you think they are, and are perfectly fine with watching it set in Japan. They were fine with the anime, weren't they.In the movie itself, they took parts of the skeleton, slapped the same(Americanized) names on completely unrecognizable characters, and made a CW-like crapola teen horror flick."
mochteam,This was actually great thriller of a movie! Don't be fooled by biased reviews!,10/10,24-Oct-17,"First off I've read the Death Note Manga, I've watched the entire Anime Series, I've seen both Japanese movies before most people even knew they existed just like Initial D. That right there said I am a Death Note fan.While I like Death Note obviously I never liked the 2nd part of the series. The Anime, Japanese movie, and Manga are all the same and the Japanese movie is the worst because it's word per word a retelling of the Manga/Anime.and you know what... it gets boring after a while. I was glad to see something that was Deathnote and different. You cant' squeeze Deathnote into 1hr and 30 minutes and expect the average person to understand what they're looking at let alone make the story interesting. Most of Deathnote is a detective story/cat and mouse game that drags on from highschool through college and into adult hood for the main character. That's a lot to fit in. It's a lot to read and it's a lot to watch.I like this movie because it condensed elements from Deathnote that hit the nail on the head but made it's own deathnote story which was enjoyable. I love Horror films too and this was a gruesome and I liked that. You didn't get that in the Anime or Manga. I also liked Light's relationship with his girlfriend which was more fun to watch than with his partner Misa in the Anime.In the Anime/Manga Light is a sociopath he barely has a personality but puts on a fake personality to appear normal. He has no other interests in his life other than killing criminals and evade the police. He's actually a pretty boring character. Misa is upbeat and the exact opposite of Light in the Anime and Manga which makes the two of them pairing up interesting to watch like Oil and Water.In the movie Lights girlfriend/partner is just like him albeit maybe even worse but the two of them understand each other. That was something the Manga and Anime never did. It never gave light someone to relate too other than L in a strange way.This movie makes Death Note fun. I would say that it's like a fun version of Deathnote if Light were a highschool student and you didn't follow him throughout life. The movie was clever and DID pay homage to the source material getting pretty much EVERYTHING right on the pieces they did use. It fit the film perfectly.That being said if you want a live action exactly like the Anime watch the Japanese version. If you want Deathnote but fun and entertaining watch this version.My only disappointment with this movie was my favorite character wasn't in it which is Rem but for her to be in it would require a completely different story arc and I get that. Also there was little shown about Ryuk and his and lights relationship as ""friends"" where they even play video games like Mario Kart together. Ryuk seems more sinister in the movie but in the Anime/Manga they're more like close friends until the final chapter.Rem in contrast actually cares about her Death not handler and is compassionate and caring which is the exact opposite of Ryuk's true personality but that again would be a different story arc.So take this move for what it is. It's not a retelling of the Anime or Manga it's a story of its own and I thought it was entertaining and fun."
dinalt10,"Not brilliant, not awful",06/10,16-Sep-17,"I wasn't even aware this was an anime adaptation, so my review's based solely on the film as I haven't seen the original source.It's a fairly predictable film, and for comparison it's probably closest to the Final Destination films (although here the lead chooses who dies).As a film it doesn't warrant a 1 star rating, but neither does it really justify any more than a 6.I'd have liked to have seen more depth given to the characters 'L', Ryku (the demon) and Watabi.As others have said, this kind of story would probably have lent itself better to a series rather than a film. That would have allowed for better character development, and better back story.By no means unwatchable, but not something you'd rush to watch again."
Neon_Gold,Riverdale meets Death Note,02/10,16-Feb-21,"I do like the anime but I don't have any nostalgia or like deep love for it so I tried to be fair when watching. It was still a complete disaster.I hate remakes of things. We have a perfectly good version of it already, we don't need another version. However this version seemed to want to just destroy everything that made the original good.The script is terrible and has all this 'funny' punch up that is just out of place and is terrible. The worst part of the writing however is the characters. They are nothing like the originals which I get it, maybe they wanted to distance themselves from them but you have perfect models to bases them off. The 'Misa' character so different than her original. She is just like generic moody teen. Light is awful he is just smart? Maybe all we know about him is he does over people's homework. L is a waste. The only one who survives is Ryuk, he is actually pretty similar and I think the actor did a good job.The acting apart from Ryuk is terrible. Mainly from the actor playing light and the actor playing L. They are so lifeless and uncommitted.I think they thought that teenagers would love this because it's like so edgy with it's blood and violence. But that isn't want makes the original good. The original is so restrained and painstakingly thought out. This was like ""oh what's cool?....blood and dark clothes!!"". It was like Riverdale meets Death Note. Terrible.I mean to sum it all up Light has a 'normal people scare me' sticker in his locker. How cool is he!"
decster98,"As a fan of the source material, I sincerely enjoyed Netflix's Death Note",08/10,26-Aug-17,"I'm giving this film a 7.5, because it's a great film, it's not perfect no, there's a few problems with it, but it's by no means a bad film. I'm a fan of the manga, I've got all of it, I then became a fan of the anime, watched all of it, and now I'm a fan of the adaptation! The thing people need to know is that they changed the story, this isn't just a cut and paste of the death note anime into a film, they made it into it's own story. The female lead was pretty unlikable and changed light's motives from the original material, but I don't mind that because it's different! This film is extremely well made, the cinematography is gorgeous and the directing is superb, I'm a big fan of Adam Wingard. Watch this film, but watch it for what it is! It's not the same as the anime, but it's fantastic in it's own right, I'm seriously disappointed by the backlash towards this film, I hope once the butthurt anime and manga fans clear out the rating will rise as the general public realises how good this film is.

Donki,They attempted the impossible,02/10,26-Aug-17,"My tittle pretty much tells it all. They had the opportunity to work with and on a great work of fiction, and they pretty much passed on all that made it stand out. Truth is, I thought from the moment they announced it, that they wouldn't be able to do it justice. This once again proves that there source materials that suffer when they are made to be more digestible to the American viewers. In this case an Eastern work of fiction was adapted to the Northern audiences. Since there is a huge difference between Japan and America, the source material lost a lot of its identity. Due to this, even if they would have followed the same path in story and character it wouldn't have been the same, due to the difference in culture and presentation. When it comes to Death Note, its not just a gripping story with great characters. Its a great Japanese work of fiction, with a gripping story and great characters.Every character in the original manga were fundamentally Asian characters, that grew up with, and represent completely different values from that of an American character. Though these things may not be apparent at first, cultural values and identity serve as the base for fictional characters when written, that go a long way in forming them.If we think about it, even the Japanese have difficulties with adapting their own Mangas."
Jellygood,Shame on the manga/anime downvoters,08/10,28-Aug-17,"This is actually a very good movie.I really don't understand people who give it a 1/10 because they think it is not the same as the manga/anime.I did not know the manga/anime (shame on me) and I like the movie. It is a solid horror movie unlike much of the garbage you see nowadays.A very good movie with a sub 5 rating because of biassed manga fans. Shame.

roflmeao,Avoid,02/10,25-Aug-17,"I wanted to like this, I really did. Loved the live action movies and, although I generally don't like anime, really liked the series.This abomination just wrecked everything. The characters lost all nuance, the plot lost all cohesion, the pacing was all wrong, character arcs non-existent.The original (either one) was a cat and mouse game of intellectual games and a clash of egos. Every move was well thought out and deliberate. Well worth a watch once you scrub this crap out of your mind.This takes the core idea of a vastly superior product and turns it into a Michael Bay movie on crack that is so bad it hurts my soul.Remakes are fine, this type of lowest common denominator tripe is not.Also, What the hell was that plot thread about the previous owner of the book that went absolutely nowhere? I thought this may extend the lore a little, apparently even that was too much effort.Verdict: Avoid like the plague it is and watch the live action movies. If you like them, give the anime a try.2/10 Would not bang -Ign (Trying to regain the humanity this movie stole) :)"
jadepietro,Enter and Sign in Please,02/10,25-Aug-17,"(RATING: ☆ out of 5) GRADE: D THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A splatter fest with some style and no sense at all.SYNOPSIS: A supernatural book can kill if your name appears on its pages.JIM'S REVIEW: Now playing at select movie theaters while also streaming on Netflix is Adam Wingard's Death Note, a stylish mess of a movie. Neither venues are fortunate to have distribution rights to this less-than-super supernatural thriller.Based on a popular Japanese manga serial, the film loses its Japanese origins and becomes an Americanized tale of two teenagers who fall in love and murder people with the help of a black magic book. Its story has been relocated to Seattle and condensed from 108 chapters into 1 lousy movie. The film is so predictable and unoriginal as it mixes the gimmicks of Donnie Darko with Final Destination to create a film about vigilante terror. The deaths are frequent and grisly as the movie celebrates blood splatter with very little suspense.All the stylish direction by Mr. Wingard (and his able cinematographer, David Tattersall) can't hide the fact that the screenplay by Charles and Vias Parlapanides and Jeremy Slater loses its way very early in the game. The plot races by so quickly and characters change their behaviors without much warning or much sense. This all leads to an ending that mystifies and becomes more preposterous.(Hearing Celine Dion's The Power of Love"" on the soundtrack just doesn't set the right mood for violence, blood, and mayhem.)The plot: A leather bound book, entitled Death Note, literally falls from the sky and into the hands of Light Turner (a very bland Nat Wolff). Whoever holds this book has the power to kill anyone in the world by simply writing their names on its pages. Our teenage anti-hero is egged on to become an active author in a supernatural Rube Goldberg murder spree by a rather large imposing porcupine demon named Ryuk (voiced by Willem DeFoe) who, for some reason, has an strong appetite for red delicious apples. Light begins by dispatching a few local bad dudes before going dark. He soon shares his tome with his girlfriend Mia (Margaret Qualley), a bit of a psycho herself, as the lovers kill more and more international criminals. These executions become a global phenomena, known as Kira, and soon law enforcement wants to track down this vigilante crusader. Enter chief detective L (Keith Stanfield) to find the culprits at large.The cast is uniformly weak, which may be the fault of the meandering script. The fine character actor, Shea Whigham, is wasted in the role of Light's dad. Mr. Wolff and Ms. Qualley have zero chemistry together. Mr. Stanfield overdoes his odd characters' many quirks (cloaking his face in turtlenecks and hoodies, unable to sit properly in a chair, shouting his lines to make a point, but the only point he makes is seriously questioning this supposedly top sleuth's own sanity.) The beast Ryuk, who takes a more supporting role in the movie, would have been a perfect villain center-stage than merely lurking in the shadows. One simply doesn't care about the characters at all.Death Note is one of many film ventures that Netflix is producing. After starting very promisingly in 2015 with one of their first productions, the excellent Beast of No Nation, the quality factor in their film ventures has been in rapid decline with diminishing results. Death Note may be ringing its final death knell to warn moviegoer to stay away. Write that in your book!"
Kimsy1724,"Interesting premise, probably better if you haven't seen the original",07/10,11-Sep-22,"This film seems to get mixed reviews. I don't know if that's because it's been based on a comic and maybe doesn't do it justice but my review comes purely from the point of view of seeing this for the first time.For a start, for me, Willem Dafoe as the villain is my absolute favourite. His voice, the way he speaks and also the facial motion captures they did for the character are so good and I can't imagine anyone else doing it.The premise is very simple, the death note is a book where you can write someone's name and they will die. You can choose how they die and you can use the book as you see fit. There are an extensive list of rules at the beginning of the book but that's basically how it works. All you need is the persons name and to have seen their face.The book finds its way to our protagonist Light Turner (Nat Wolff) a slightly down in the mouth teenager who was struggling to be noticed by the girls he likes, the target of the local bully and at loggerheads with his father who he feels has let him down and bringing the perpetrator of his mothers death to justice. The death note demon Ryuk appears to him and goads him into writing a name into the book. Light decides to choose the aforementioned bully with his cause of death and then witnesses a freak accident making this death true.Later that evening he decides to write the name of the criminal who murdered his mother into the book. The next morning his father updates him that the criminal has died in the method that Light had written. When at school, the girl he likes Mia is sceptical of this book when he shows her, so he searches the television for a local crime happening and uses the book to have this criminal die in such a specific way that there can be no doubt that he is not the one orchestrating it.Between the two of them, they decide to use the book for ""good"" by using it to kill criminals, warlords and terrorists and do so under the name of Kira (Japanese for killer) which hopefully will draw detectives away from their origin in Seattle.This attracts the attention of a world renowned supersleuth known only as ""L"" who theorises that the killer can only make their move by knowing someone's face and name and proves this theory by calling them out on a live broadcast.The cracks begin to appear when Mia and Light have very different opinions on how the book should be used. Mia wants to take down anyone possible whereas Light is adamant it should only be used against those who are bad. The book contains a handwritten warning from somebody who advises not to trust Ryuk and when several FBI agents seemingly take their own lives, this creates a major fracture with Light thinking that Ryuk has its own agenda and has worked against him to do this.I won't reveal the ending or how the film plays out but there are lots of clever twists and turns and I have to say that I actually quite enjoyed the film.I know that it has got very poor reviews and I think that's probably because a lot of people have seen the original but for me having never seen anything to do with it before I don't think it was that bad."
nikkilynn487,Why so much hate?,09/10,12-Feb-19,"This was an interesting movie and the acting is great. Can't wait for the sequel. I know nothing of the original but this was super fun to me. The demon is also crazy looking.

pjk5,A loose adaptation of the original,06/10,25-Aug-17,"The movie is worth a watch if you have 2 hours to kill but it's no masterpiece like the original anime. I believe it to be a dumbed down version, since neither L or Light are shown to be clever. Each character is different from the original adaptation, in fact the only similarities with the original is that there is a Death Note and the shinigami Ryuk who carries out the command. I did not like how L specifically was portrayed with his emotions overwhelming him for 2/3 of the film, and talking like a robot i.e. ""Force me to do the same and I assure you will not survive."" as he was being choked out. Maybe Netflix can learn from the shortfalls of this film and bring another beloved Japanese adaptation to American audiences such as Great Teacher Onizuka.

dissident320,What are we doing here?,04/10,27-Aug-17,"This movie is already getting heavily criticized for not being a faithful adaptation to the source material. I went in having no seen or read any of it. I just wanted to see if it was good movie regardless of what it was drawing from. Is it an enjoyable movie? No it's pretty terrible.The good:There's some solid to excellent performances in here. Lakeith Stanfield who plays L stands out as someone who raising up the material to the point where you forget you're watching an awful movie. I would have vastly preferred we just followed his character the whole time. Shea Whigham as Light's father is fine but he's more just plodding through the dialogue rather than improving anything. Willem Dafoe seems to be having fun as Ruyk but he never seems to fully enter the movie and they never fully commit to him being the villainThe bad:When it comes to the leads this movie very quickly outstays its welcome. Nat Wolff as Light is completely devoid of personality. I guess he's a loser in school for some reason. He could never convincingly emote nor do anything with the (admittedly terrible) dialogue. Margaret Qualley as his love interest was also equally awful. With her it was kind of bad acting converging with a bad screenplay. Both her and Light have no character arcs and just seem to do what the story tells them. They have no chemistry and their relationship development consists of laughable montage.The tone of this movie could have saved it. If they went over the top gore or perhaps the route of Heathers and treated death with more humour it would have had something going for it. Instead it treats death lightly and then deadly serious back and forth. It doesn't have a clear idea on what wants to say or what it wants the audience to feel.The okay:This movie looks okay. This is a decent director who has done movies that aren't terrible. I question him wanting to shoot so wide (2.35:1) because he doesn't fill the frame very well so it ends up looking cropped. Also, I'm not sure if it was the cameras or the lenses but it looked more like a TV show than a movie. It was lit well but nothing made it feel above a television pilot.This movie just isn't fun. The source material seems like a neat idea but the director either didn't watch or read any of it or they wanted to make it super serious. The ending which I won't spoil is completely ridiculous and sadly appropriate for this movie. Don't watch this. Don't trick Netflix into thinking they should make more of these."
euryan,A good movie with biased reviews.,08/10,26-Aug-17,"Just got done watching Death Note. I really liked it so I was quite surprised to see such a low score here on IMDb (5.0). It was confusing so I started reading the reviews to see why people didn't like it and every one star review said virtually the same thing, ""source material is sooo much better."" That, however, is irrelevant to whether or not this is a good movie. People are obviously giving this a dishonest and biased review because they love the original more. They are not judging it objectively and dispassionately, and perhaps they can't, so let me do it.First let me say I have not seen or read the source material, therefore my opinion of this movie is not biased by some cult like love for the source material, unlike all the one star reviews I have seen here.I wasn't sure if I would like this movie after seeing the preview, but I was curiously optimistic and thankfully I wasn't let down. The story is great obviously, which explains why the manga has such fervent admirers. I thought it was well cast, and I had no complaints about the acting. I really liked the cinematography. It was clean and crisp most the time with several creative shots or transitions that made the movie interesting but weren't distracting. I liked the wide angle shots and the slow twisting of the camera in certain shots that made them creepy. The movie does seem to speed through parts of the story that could be very interesting but I understand making a series fit into an hour and half will require some things to be omitted or glossed over, all in all it works. The movie held my attention from start to finish and I honestly never knew what was going to happen. What really makes this movie interesting is that main character, Light, has an arch rival simply known as ""L"" Light and ""L"" are both very brilliant. 'L"" is a super genius detective and Light has supernatural power with his possession of the Death Note. They are like Sherlock Holmes and James Moriarty. But which one is the good guy? At first we are rooting for Light but things become messy. While we know Light has made mistakes we still end up rooting for him in the end, although, if ""L"" were to exact justice against Light we'd probably be OK with that too. I'm sure if I had seen or read the originals I would be a little let down, but thankfully I watched this first and was able to really enjoy it. I'm definitely going to check out the animated series. TL;DR If you haven't seen or read the original, you'll really like this well made movie."
imaneml,Hollywood garbage,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I am writing this to stop all those who liked the anime from watching this what i consider not a movie but garbage... *this might contain some spoilers so don't read if u don't want to be spoiled*First of all the Light in this adaptation wasn't smart at all (no being a straight A kid doesn't make u smart, u study a lot u get good marks and that s what Light was) that they caught so fast u had to wonder if they didn't make him a retard. And a huge attention seeker that he revealed all the secrets of the death note to the first girl he met to impress her (i really don't understand why they have to force a romance in American movies) i think that the writers wanted to satisfy the American white audience forgetting that the whole world was expecting this movie.i wont forget the scenario that's horribly written, and the horrible acting (the first meeting of ryuk and light for example)...I think it would have been better if they weren't just rushing the scenes, if they took enough time to make a full complete story. They would have clarified a lot of things it they just made this into a TV showI gave it one star and i wish i could give it less, cuz even if it was a separate movie that has nothing to do with death note i don't think any of you would ever like it."
lacerda-tomas,"You know the awesome anime of Death Note? Yeah, this ain't it.",01/10,27-Aug-17,"Utterly bad in so many aspects that's just appalling. Thought Netflix was smarter than this. Don't watch, it doesn't deserve your time. Terrible choice for Light, terrible actor, the character it's just idiotic to be honest. I would respect if they tried to do the Death Note, with different characters and all, but if you using the same ones, at least keep their core. Netflix clearly didn't do enough research to understand what the fans most valued in Death Note, as such, it seems having billions is not enough to have brains.

shadow-cipher,I have no idea why I sat through this,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I'm not gonna bother going into grand detail, because this movie doesn't deserve it, and I don't want it to deserve it. I went into this with low expectations, but I should have set them even lower than what they already were. Almost every character is disloyal to the source material, with Ryuk being the closest to the original.Light is a coward, L overreacts too much, and the only reason I could even identify Misa was because of the name - Mia.It didn't take long for me to decide I hated pretty much every character in the entire movie. By the end, I was practically begging Ryuk to just kill everyone so I could be done with that experience. And even that was a letdown, because L didn't die, Light didn't die, and the ending literally gave us no closure.Where was Rem? Where was Near? Where was Mello? Where were all the other important characters? The answer? Likely in a better movie thanking the high heavens they didn't have to get involved in that awful travesty of a movie."
ericrnolan,"A short review of ""Death Note"" (2017)",08/10,02-Sep-17,"True to its manga origins, Netflix' ""Death Note"" (2017) seems cartoonish and sometimes intentionally silly. That doesn't stop it from being a lot of fun, though — this is the most original, offbeat horror tale I've seen in a while, and I'd rate it an 8 out of 10.It's definitely a genre-buster — it's one part comic book, one part horror tale, one part eastern theological fantasy and one part dark teen romance. It succeeds in part because it has an interesting supernatural story setup that seems reminiscent an episode of ""The X-Files."" (A magical notebook allows it owner to sentence anyone to death, simply by writing the victim's name down, and describing how they die.)It also succeeds because it has a great bogeyman — a seemingly omnipotent demon named Ryuk. His visual design is creative and wickedly creepy, and his character is menacingly voiced by none other than Willem Dafoe.Finally, Shea Whigham is very good as the teen protagonist's tough but likable dad. I thought I remembered him only from his relatively minor role in this year's ""Kong Skull Island."" But, as it turns out, he was actually the sympathetic escaped convict from 2008's criminally underrated monster movie, ""Splinter."" He's a great actor.I really liked this. I'd recommend it."
paulclaassen,Dreadful!,02/10,20-Jun-18,"It really is a pity the film was not as impressive as the visuals. What started off as an interesting, creepy idea soon spiralled downwards into weirdness. The film eventually became laughable and almost unwatchable as the characters and the demon became ridiculous and the plot preposterous. ""L"" was the most annoying, unconvincing character, and also very badly acted by Lakeith Stanfield. This idiotic character can't even sit properly on a chair like a normal person! When a detective dies of a heart attack, L immediately assumes they have been compromised and warns the entire force. Really? Why? What if it was just a heart attack? What's with his sweet addiction? That, too, became overdone and annoying. When Light Turner and Mia called their 'god' KIRA, it became a propaganda religious sect and utterly boring. The word Kira must have been used about a thousand times in the movie. I mean jeez!!Mia as the love interest was forced into the story and the whole love story idea became utterly pathetic. There was just no chemistry whatsoever between the characters. Even the use of the 80's music was inappropriate. This was boring. Yawn..."
applebury_pie,"Don't let the reviews turn you off, I found it very entertaining.",07/10,24-Sep-17,"If you are expecting to see the manga or anime you will be disappointed, it is its own story so if you go into it with that mindset you my be surprised how good the movie is. I have read the manga and watch the anime, And i found the live action adaptation to be as good or better than the original and honestly can't wait for a sequel. So go watch the movie and decide for yourself if it's worth watching or not. Hope this review helped!

Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Takes a classic Japanese franchise, and turns it into a technically gorgeous, but campy retelling!",05/10,28-Aug-17,"Netflix's Death Note is a troubling beast; it starts off HORRIBLY wrong, Light is an overly sensitive wuss who screams like a girl when he first sees Ryuk in the movie, and the film takes a 37-episode anime and 12-volume manga compressing ALL OF THAT into a measly 1 hour and 40 minute film released on Netflix.The writing is sloppy, the casting is misguided (except Dafoe as Ryuk is amazing for the most part), and the direction slips between feeling like a television-teen-drama to Hollywood-blockbuster at other times. All I can say is that it's an experiment that might have meant well, but got released on Netflix because there wasn't an audience for it at the cinema (it would have flopped harder than Ghost in the Shell).It's got a GREAT colour-palette, like the neo-noir inspired blues and reds emphasised in certain scenes, and it could have been a well-told story had it been given more time length-wise and pacing-wise. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here; and the film suffers for it.If you like the source material like I do, you're going to be disappointed BIG TIME. If not, then maybe you'll rather enjoy it for what it is, not for what it's not. Me personally, it's an awkwardly done crime story, unlike the original Death Note."
FlashCallahan,Avenge me!.........,06/10,06-Oct-17,"Having never seen the original film, I had no idea what to expect, but the high concept was sound, and the idea of Willem Defoe playing a demon had me sold.A student who discovers a supernatural notebook that allows him to kill anyone begins a crusade against evil in order to rule the world as a benevolent human god. Then a deadly game of cat and mouse begins when a reclusive detective begins to track down the young man, attempting to end his reign of terror once and for all......The first act is suitably impressive, with Light getting to know the ins and outs of the titular book, and the first kill is gory enough to satisfy the most bloodthirsty of gore-hounds.But it had an air of Final Destination to it. And here in is where the problem lies, the film is reminiscent of so many other horror films from the early nought Ines that it struggles hard to find its own voice.Defoe is excellent as the Crypt Keeper alike demon, but as the film goes on, he becomes more carnival sideshow clown than demon, and he has a distinct air of the Green Goblin in his performance.The final act becomes a little too clever for its own good, with double crosses turning into triple and quadruple crosses, and it loses its sense of horror, turning it into a more conspiracy type thriller.It's fun though, the first act is strong enough to keep you intrigued until the end, but this will stay firmly on the shelf where Urban Legen, and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer are gathering dust....."
leonthesleepy,Surprisingly decent! But you have to accept that its tonally VERY different.,05/10,25-Aug-17,"Look, everyone knows there is no way you can take an entire season and condense it into one movie. And with Death Note already having an Anime, and several live action movies, the American remake wisely sets out to be something very different. No its not amazing, but its vastly superior to the other Anime Adaptions like The Last Airbender or Dragonball Z. IF you can accept that the characters are nothing like the source material, then you'll enjoy this adaptation. In fact the more unfamiliar with the source material you are, the better. The movie pretty much sprints through the plot from the start, establishing the main players and rules within minutes. The condensation of the plot works for the most part thanks to the stylistic direction. And hell, even knowing the original's plot, it was fun to see such a different and stylistic departure. If anything, i wish there was more of it, because the movie moves too fast for its own good. You wont get the philosophical debates, or much character set up. Which is a shame because what IS there is good. There is a slasher/thriller vibe to the film, and the cat and mouse feeling from the original is still there, if diluted. Willem Dafoe is fantastic as Ryuk, and Nat Wolff's Light Turner worked much better than expected. Its a much more animated, punkish performance but it works for the highly stylized reinvention that Adam Wingard goes for.What doesn't work is Lakeith Stanfield as 'L'. Its just TOO different of an interpretation, and the manic performance he gives just overwhelms the film which is already bursting with energy. The plot also suffers from being so condensed. To the film's credit, it at least makes sense, but it breezes through what feels like an entire season in under 2 hours. At the end of the day, this was a solid high concept 'B' movie that stands on its own as a fun power fantasy thriller. Its weak on the characterization, but the slick production values and breakneck pace makes for a fun, if shallow ride. It could have been a lot more if Netflix just made it into a Season instead of a movie."
PickleRick,"If the intelligence and inventiveness of the original irritated you, you're in luck",01/10,26-Aug-17,"Everything that made the original IP great is missing. Characters aren't super smart or clever any more, they're kinda dumb and impulsive. The intricate building of the gray moral zone and the characters' relation to it is now a 10 second montage. I could go on and on. Dafoe as Ryuk is genius level casting, but the character is marginalized and has little screen time. What a waste.

pait_mojo,"Some actually ""good concepts"" despite ""unfaithful"" to original but ""fail in executions""",06/10,25-Aug-17,"Alright, Death Note Netflix is not as bad as I thought. Though In no way that this is faithful to the originals or purposely wanted it to be. So fans will likely hate it and other non-fans just might enjoyed it if they could pass certain things. 6/10 to me as a fan of the series. If this project was a 8 episodes TV series instead of movie, I could see the studio might just produced a better scripts.This movie is basically: Green Goblin Ryuk, no way he's neutral though he's definitely the best part cause' W. Defoe's voices is amazing. Light and L kinda dumb & arrogance. But at least both have some redeemable traits. Mia /Misa is a total bitch in good or bad ways. Some bending rules for the book that purposely made as total hack to make some intense drama. Hyper violence but little to nothing of intense smart/intelligence cat & mouse fights. Even Breaking Bad has this totally balanced up. Great cinematography in most of the scenes.Passable OST, yep already forget about it.I did see the twist the moment both Light & L made a pretty dumb move. NO POTATO CHIP SCENE!!! THAT'S THE REAL CRIME OF THIS MOVIE! LOL"
akash-75012,A Great and a must watch. Leaves you guessing till the end.,08/10,25-Aug-17,"Specifically writing this review to anyone here in doubt thinking if they should watch it. You should. First of all this is not a hundred percent anime adaptation so all the complaints about this one not being at par with the original should be written of. This is a "" What if death note was made in America"" movie. The culture, the setting and atmosphere is different than Japan. If you're a fan of the original series like me then you should go on to this one without any expectations and forgetting all about original one. Now coming to the movie as I said is a must watch for fans of the anime. A high school student gets a hold of something that he shouldn't have and makes some decision which will change his life. This is where it gets different than the anime and you should go check it out why. The acting was average but not at all bad considering you can animate something according to your desires but acting on the other hand is a tough job. Since I'm not a critic so I won't go into minor details and point out negative points pointlessly ha ha . I will rate it by how much I enjoyed it and that's a solid 8/10.

ezzeldeenmohamed52,disappointing,01/10,25-Aug-17,simply if you saw the anime and u wish to see the movie well.....just don't the only credit for Netflix is that it made it movie but did it did it right = no ....story line is really fast its just like they depend that you watched the anime and know the general idea also the character in the movie is completely different from the anime as if they made him less smart and much arrogant and more disparate ..... i just wished it was written and made better really disappointed
dschmeding,"Not a manga fanboy here, rather a fan of Wingards work",07/10,24-Dec-17,"Let me preface this by saying... shame on me, I do not know the japanese original, so all i can judge is this movie itself. I mainly watched this because I am a huge fan of Adam Wingards previous movies and I definitly was not disappointed on that matter. This is a solid movie which incorporates a lot of elements from Wingards previous work. The movie starts of with a kind of dreamy slow motion sequence and then gets into the plot very fast with some short outbursts of onscreen brutality, awesome camera work with many interesting angles and an 80ies soundtrack ... all of which manages to build atmosphere nicely. Its a very american movie in how the plot is presented and I can imagine how they dumbed it down a lot for this remake. Many decisions by the main character Light and his girlfriend Mia seem a little dumb and uninspired... their whole relationship is kind of stupid in how it unfolds. There are some serious weird parts to the story like Light being a ""genius"" who is to dumb to read all rules of a book that basically hands him the world and falling for a girl who obviously sucks from the get-go, so some things developing later are easy to predict. These are the strongest misses of Death Note in my opinion... otherwise this is a really solid movie with an interesting plot.Seriously... I can imagine being disappointed by the plot if you are a fan of the original but to vote this 1 or 2 points is damn ignorant and rather makes you sound like a spoilt brat that can't take art in all its components and needs to trash the whole thing because one or some elements are not to his supposedly superior taste.So, if you want to watch an entertaining movie and don't know the japanese original... just do it. I doubt you will be too disappointed. Just wanted to drop this review because I think the fanboy reviews here are kind of retarded and misleading.Oh, and btw... the ending, well... that was not too glorious really. But when I see that Netflix is kind of sliding on making a second movie just in case this gets enough money, the half-assed ending makes kind of sense."
ajhotaling,Absolute Garbage,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I could not even finish this pile of trash. It was like watching the physical embodiment of AIDS. Literally never written a review for a movie in my life, but this is necessary. Worst movie in the history of adaptations or movies in general. Should be removed from Netflix immediately and never shown ever again. Please burn all copies and strike from the record of the human race.

wabizuke2,"Not a bad movie, but a lot of bad reviews..",08/10,26-Aug-17,"People keep saying that this movie is ""white-washed"" and keep giving it bad reviews because of this, which is why the rating is so low. They do the same thing every time a white person play a character of color, but they do not bat an eye when its the other way around; ironic. However, in this movie that is not the case; apparently the people writing their reviews and have seen the anime missed the part that the characters in the anime is actually white.. so give it a rest. Now.. the movie can't even compare to the anime, but it's very good for what it is. For people who haven't watched the anime this will be a great film as well. If they did the characters exactly the same, and everything else the same as the anime, then people would complain that it was to much a like the anime. You can never please those people. Enjoy the movie! It's good."
newgenbey,Dont listen to the 12 year old kids,07/10,06-Feb-23,"Most ppl hated it bc it wasnt like the original. Seems like the weebs fanatics were disappointed. They thought the movie had to be 100% like the anime. Jeez grow up.. This movie is different. In this one instead of using her gf, Light loves her gf. Together they use the book. He was willing to give it up to be together with her. But she ended up betraying him bc of the book itself. That's the difference between light anime and light in this movie. Even b4 he got the book he had eyes on her. And the book brought them closer but also destroyed them. This movies showed light is typical high school student who falls in love too. Its how power corrupts ppl. In this movie he never kill any non criminal. My point is its a different version than the original. Besides there's already a live action one in 2006."
michael-d-j-atkinson,A decent above average film,06/10,10-Sep-17,This film is getting a lot of heat from the people who enjoy the original. I've never seen the anime and because of it I don't have judgment for this film to be something its not. I don't see it fair people are voting this 1s just because its different to a previous version.I found the film entertaining. With great voice acting by William Dafoe the voice of Ryuk. He made the character a believable scary trickster. The base idea of the film I thought was brilliant. *Slight spoiler* The ending was a good twist with almost the cockney crime film style explaining what happened.The film is definitely worth the watch. 6/10 Highly enjoyable.
residentgrigo,An admirable effort in a sea of bad live action manga adaptations,05/10,25-Aug-17,"This is the best life action version of Death Note yet but that wasn't too hard. This American take is so different that new names should have been used but even that would have been problematic. Someone would then have decided to make this a soft-sequel to the event from the manga and all viewers would then ask themselves why they aren't watching the ""original story"" instead. Having our protagonist Light develop from a milk toast to a psycho over the course of 93 minutes and not just a 2 chapters is actually an improvement on the source material and Nat Wolff showed decent range in the role. His now romantic girlfriend is arguably a step down and the decision to make Misa a classmate instead of an obsessed fan-girl is way too contrived. His nemesis L is very good in the role but behaves like his later apprentice Mello. Willem Dafoe also got to play the role of a lifetime, even if Ryuk is just a sporting role. The cast worked pretty well overall, even if nitpicks can be had, and the film is well directed.All the problems are with the script, as it crams way too much into 1 single film and this should have been a (still short) miniseries instead. This and the very intriguing cliffhanger ending are the film's major flaws. You don't feel like having seen a complete product in the end and want to start the next film/episode but there isn't one as of now. I would be more critical of the film if we were swamped with great life action adaptation of manga/anime but we instead continue to get unwatchable trash as the Death Note J-Drama or the US Ghost in the Shell so i need to applaud productions that bothered to understand the core of what they were adapting! Adam Wingard's crew certainly tried under challenging circumstances and gave me an entertaining remix of a modern classic, so i look forward to more. It was lastly interring to see all the inventive gore in a story that was originally intended to be read by schoolboys. It fits pretty well. 6,5/10PS: The first Japanese Death Note film is OK too. Comparing both is actually pretty interesting, as it has the better script while the US version managed to trump all other aspects."
jaime-851-971604,Great movie if you ignore the source material,08/10,25-Aug-17,"While I'm familiar with Death Note, I've neither read the original Manga nor seen the original film. With that said, I really enjoyed the movie. It's getting a really bad rap from the manga 'experts' but just take it at face value as entertainment. The acting is great, special effects on point, and I personally enjoyed the storyline. Haters be d*mned!

sgcim,"I never saw the original, and still thought this sucked",01/10,28-Aug-17,"I never saw the original, and still thought this movie was terrible. The actors didn't even seem to be acting; just reading their lines as fast and as quietly as they could. There was no sense of tension building up in the film; the chase scene just seemed thrown in to try to add some excitement. I know that most US versions of Japanese fiction are bad (with the exception of Ring), but this film just seemed like a rushed, beginner's attempt at making a film. Wingard has made some good films in the past, but this is not one of them.I don't even feel like watching the Japanese TV series on Netflix after seeing this pitifully directed and acted mess. The music was horrible, also.

Finfrosk86,Final Destination + Brainscan = entertaining horror flick.,07/10,27-Aug-17,"What the hell? Under the cursed 5-limit on IMDb? WHAT!? Aah, oh yeah, it based on something. All the annoying the-original-is-better-people creep out of the woodwork. Give it a rest, huh? Because this is a remake, you see. Or should I say the-word-that-shall-not-be-uttered? Or a remake of a movies that's based on a manga, something. So to show that THEY have seen the original, probably also before it was cool, people hate on this American remake. (haha, I actually saw a review on here, that complained Ryuks -forehead- was too big! Yeah! HAHA. Says quite a lot doesn't it)I had never heard of this movie before, so I watched it with a fresh mind. And I was thoroughly entertained. Actually, early on in the movie I thought to myself: ""ok, this is entertaining, I look forward to what's gonna happen next"". Not a feeling I get that often these days.Apart from one thing I reacted to, later on in the movie, (about plans and stuff, not to spoil) there really wasn't much I didn't like in Death Note. It's not like everything I've seen before, definitely had some interesting stuff. Kind of like a mix between Brainscan and Final Destination. Plus some tweaks. I really liked it. The effects are good. the pacing is good. The acting is alright, nothing special, but nothing that took me out of it either. I'm not gonna go on and on, but let me just say: I liked it, it entertained me, probably will see it again some time later. My rating is between 7 and 8, but the super low score on here made me doubt myself, so I'll say 7 for now. May bump it up later."
Achyut_Prashast_Singh,Words fail to contain my disappointment.,01/10,20-Jul-23,"I am a huge fan of the Death Note anime. I spent nights binging its episodes on Netflix and always wanted to watch more and more. It was that addictive. In just 37 episodes, it managed to be a well-made supernatural mystery, a crime drama and a psychological thriller all at the same time without trying too hard. Its concept alone was so good that the negative reviews for this so-called adaptation couldn't stop me from curiously checking it out and... while I seemed to like it in the first 15-20 minutes, it turned out to be a trainwreck.Whenever I'm watching a ""good"" movie, I don't think too much and just engage with it like some bystander who wants to give the makers a chance to entertain him. But during this film, I couldn't help but feel enraged at the execution. Light, who is originally a very intelligent person in the anime, is reduced to a brat who just manages to find the Death Note and things get out of control. I have no problems with different iterations but since this is an ""adaptation"" of Death Note and has its characters Light, L, Mi(s)a and Ryuk, I couldn't just view it like another film, especially after having seen the anime as well as the first live-action adaptation done brilliantly by the Japanese themselves.What's good about the film is the dark tone, and a couple of deaths. It really pushes the horror quotient unlike the source material which isn't really a horror title. A couple of twists are decent. There's mostly talking but one action sequence towards the climax is executed with rawness and intensity; gotta give the credit where it's due.But the bad? EVERYTHING ELSE!The biggest undoing of this film was L. No, not only the casting, but he was written for this adaptation in such a weird and unconvincing way even someone who looked like L would appear pathetic. L in the anime was a smart detective who did a lot of things but never expressed his rage or acted violently like a vigilante. He always behaved like a proper investigator, and in fact considered Light his first friend. The makers avoided all of that, making him scream and act in an over-the-top manner. One of the biggest highlights of the source material was the mind game between Light and L which led to debates about whether or not L knew Light was Kira himself.This film on the other hand never explained how L found Light was Kira; he just knew. Why? Because he's THE L. His screaming and behavior got on my nerves very quickly. He had no composure whatsoever and looked like he had some sort of anxiety going on inside of him. And Mia... where do I begin? If the intention was to make us hate her, the director succeeded. But if not, I don't know what to say. She totally overshadowed Light in so many parts it was irritating. Light and Misa in the original were portrayed in a brilliant manner where Light was the one doing the manipulation and acting like someone with a God complex, which also served as a basis for the series' commentary on how some lines should never be crossed. But here? No, sir! Gone is that God complex, gone is the lack of guilt that made it hard to fully root for Light and gone is the commentary in spite of some dialogues about right and wrong.Willem Dafoe's voice was the only actual good thing about this film; even the VFX for Ryuk was horrible and it looked better only with his red glowing eyes and face covered in darkness. And also let's talk about the music. Some really weird choices, I must say. The climax scene had some annoying acting from L's actor going on and the song that played didn't seem to fit the tone. And sorry for missing that one shot that made me laugh a lot: L's reaction to Watari's death. You need to see it for yourself to believe me.Moreover, I heard there could be a sequel and that is absolutely scarier than the first decapitation in the film. Sadly we will have to mention this film every time we talk about live action anime adaptations because I have never personally seen a more horrible adaptation than this. This film legit made me angry, even as someone who was watching it with an open mind and was enjoying the initial few minutes. When you search Death Note on Netflix, you will find the anime as well. Go watch that and you won't regret it while this... this is going to cause a lot of damage, especially if you are familiar with the source material and know it's outstanding."
purplehottie-67999,Why use the main characters if they weren't even remotely close to the original? I'd give negative stars if I could.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"Never have I written a review for a movie before, but this movie sucked so much I decided to take time out of my day make an account and express to you all my anger. I tried to give this movie a chance and I know that one should not expect movies to be the same as a show or book, but damn they butchered the characters. I can deal with movies slightly changing the story line to make a movie because obviously they cannot fit it all in the hour and forty one minutes, but man they messed this one up. What's the deal with Light? They completely changed his personality and made him a wimpy guy who makes plans with his high school girlfriend Mia. Where's that charismatic, egocentric, intellectual character that devised all these exciting and psychologically thrilling plans? Then there's this Mia character, who I am going to assume is suppose to be Misa. They made it seem like Light needed her opinion on every matter. When Light was a person who cared for no one, but himself and would not hesitate to kill someone if it interfered with his plans. Then there's Ryuk, sure they picked a good voice actor for him, but what's with him interfering so much. Ryuk liked to just watch and only occasionally would give Light information and why the hell couldn't Mia see him if she touched the death note. There's so much more that angered me, but I think the fact that they decided to use the main characters and then proceeded to change them completely is what bothered me the most. I did not care for the characters physical appearances, but their personalities is something important and what made me like some of the characters from the anime. Seriously they should have just said that the movie was based off of Death Note. If they had advertised it like that and made the exact same movie and changed the characters names and been like ""There's similarities with Death Note, but these aren't the same characters"", then I don't think would have felt so disturbed by it. Overall this movie exceeded my disappointment, but like some of the other reviews I have read maybe if you haven't seen Death Note you'll like it, but as for those who have and are fans DO NOT WATCH IT!"
radhrh,Neat idea......but,05/10,15-Sep-22,"Death Note starts off strongly with a neat idea, by writing some one's name in a note book that person will die. You can even specify how they will die and almost immediately that will occur. This is all controlled by a demon named Ryuk (Willem Dafoe) who also likes apples (?) So the first act is pretty strong with some satisfyingly gory deaths like a man being decapitated by a flying lader. The second act introduces a young super slueth named ""L"" who tries to solve the deaths of 400 bad guys world wide. He's quite an interesting character and we later learn some of his back story. However things go off the rails in the third act where superfluous plot twists lead to a less than satisfactory finale. The acting is meh, Willem Dafoe is unrecognizable behind his CGI mask and none of the other characters stand out. The direction is bland, there's little to no visual flair. Disappointing given the striking visuals of the poster. After the first act there's a distinct lack of gore as the film becomes more a dark fantasy than a horror. Bizarrely the closing credits feature behind the scenes still of the making of the movie. Why?

manojitbaidya,Just Unique 👌,08/10,05-Jun-21,"I really don't understand why people gave all this negative reviews! Maybe there are some technical fault in this movie or the original animated series is much better than the live action movie and people just comparing the movie with the anime series. I don't have time to watch the animated series. I just watch the 2017 released movie. The concept is really unique and that's what I look first in any film. The carecter 'Mia' and 'L', they did it really good. I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel.

markemek,Make Nippon Great Again!,01/10,27-Aug-17,"It's amazing to see the difference between what the Japanese view as a valedictorian to how the U.S. seems to view valedictorians... Taking only the premise and stripping away the content is a very typical American way of adapting a film. I wish Hollywood and the rest would start revering their audience as more intelligent. Especially when it comes to an audience with an appreciation to Japanese culture.

Mysterygeneration,A goofy main character who differ from the main source,05/10,16-Feb-23,"Adam Wingard has a remarkable talent for using the relationship between image and audio to convey the emotions of his characters. Take a look at the opening scene of The Guest by Maika Monroe, in which the teen lead character is clearly smitten with her new crush as she sprawls out on her bed and listens to music. As Joss Whedon recently observed of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode, the movie becomes about her shattering fantasy of forever being in such a time and crushing her wish to be wrapped inside another person. Death Note, Wingard's ninth film, transforms the same-named Japanese manga into a distinctively American story about how the embraces and thrusts of new love might become instruments of worldwide annihilation and dominance. In Death Note, sexual relations between a young couple give birth to a new world order, as opposed to The Guest, where such impulses were crushed at the feet of a corporate corporation.Wingard's decision to use montage to show Light and Mia's transition into worldwide terrorists rather than a more overt depiction of sex as an all-consuming force results in a hazy, illogical reconciliation between their roles as mass killers and their treatment as international celebrities. Death Note can no longer be saved, even though the final third of the movie goes back to their interests. Wingard's keen depiction of youthful lovers in heat has been drained by the inanities of franchise footwork."

irvintang,The anime was better,05/10,25-Aug-17,"The only thing this adaptation adopts is the premise of the death note, a book that kills people if their name is written on it. Where the original manga and anime were so much more. In the anime, there were lots of psychology and mind games between the characters it's like a constant chess match of out thinking the opponent. They were thoughtful and contemplative and hardly ever lose their cool. It would have been successful even without the ""death note"" gimmick, if Light were killing people with nano machines or even traditionally like Dexter it still would've been an engaging story. This adaptation have the characters screaming and emotional all the time. I'm not against changing the story by placing the characters in different situation or having alternate endings, like Peter Parker end up with Gwen or him teaming up with Green Goblin. But when you changed the spirit of the character and make him feels like a bully in the amazing spiderman then you might as well call it something else because Peter Parker are many things but never a bully. Which is what this version of death note is, it might as well be something else because it completely butchered the spirit of the original material. Not the premise, not general story, but the spirit of the characters. Gone are the battle of the minds which are replaced by running and screaming like some Tom Cruise movie. To be fair, the Japanese real life adaptation didn't do the anime justice either. Perhaps this is better off as a series and cannot be compressed into a movie and still retain the genius of what it was. But even if they stretched this version out into a series it would still fall short due to the writers and directors missing the point; it's not about the book, it's about the characters."
mustbeskywanderers,By even considering watching this movie you have already wasted more than enough time on it.,01/10,26-Aug-17,"This movie does not deserve to use the title ""Death Note"", nor any of the characters names. The story does not even vaguely follow the original source material, and the characters have been changed so drastically in personality that they have no right to have used their names.Do not waste a single second on this movie. It is beyond poorly written, the actors are stiff and generally dreadful with the exception of Kieth Stanfield who seems to be doing the best that he can with a poorly written, off-brand L, the production efforts are absolutely minimal, it does not follow the original source in any way, shape, or form, and suffers from both dreadful pacing and mass amounts of plot holes.Avoid this movie like the plague.

Sleepin_Dragon,"Some nice effects, but generally poor.",04/10,25-Jan-18,"The credit and positives go to the original source material, the concept is excellent, the adaptation here is sadly fundamentally flawed. The film is lacking any true heart, the characters are all loathsome, it's just so poor on so many levels. Ryuk is the biggest disappointment, I did not like the appearance, which was very B movie, Willem Dafoe's voice was so out of place. The film feels very incoherent, it doesn't flow somehow, it feels like it jars awkwardly. Nat Wolff was perhaps the best thing about the film, I thought he's rather good as Light. I find it so disappointing that Hollywood constantly has to rehash works, there is no originality, when have they ever successfully remade something? This is quite poor.

view_and_review,What Nerdy Boys Won't do for Sex,06/10,20-Dec-17,"This movie started with some early cliches: a socially outcast nerd, a bully and a foul-mouthed wannabe badass girl. At that point I wanted to turn it off. How many times do I have to see the exact same tropes played out on screen? Not this time. But, I was merciful and gave the movie another try and it genuinely became interesting.The premise of the movie is quite simple: there exists a book in which if the name of a person is written then that person perishes however the writer chooses. Of course you know this is a dangerous road to traverse and I wouldn't be a spoiler saying that. When two socially awkward teen lovers get a hold of the book then all kinds of criminals start dying. Worldwide hundreds of top tier criminals begin getting killed in Final Destination style. In fact, Final Destination is a good movie to compare this to. As marvelous as the two thought this was, not everyone is a fan of vigilanteism and a net starts closing around them.The real title of this movie should be: What Nerdy Boys Won't do for a Girl's Attention. That's what it boiled down to; a boy trying to impress a girl and then it went too far. The movie was on the graphic side with some gruesome deaths. Then it seemed they dropped a character in there just to further along the plot and create drama. There was a super-detective from Japan that played a major role in things getting hot for the couple. They eventually gave some back story to the super-detective which made his presence a little less weird.The movie wasn't as bad as I initially anticipated so for that I give it a 6/10."
cetankstinson,This movie was so bad I had to make an account to vent.,01/10,27-Aug-17,"I loved the original. This movie spits it it's face. It has none of the wit of the original and feels more like watching Twilight. This is play it safe lowest common denominator writing at it's finest. The whole premise of the original, a battle of wits between Light and L, is reduced to (spoiler?) a bunch of crying and running. I walked away from this movie three times angry at how bad it was before making it to the end. Willem Dafoe as Ryuk had me thinking about green goblin every time he was on screen. Lakeith Stanfield did a good job despite the horrific script and seeing Paul McGillion pop up is always great."
krbpedersen,Why this movie isn't as sh*t as you keep saying it is,06/10,07-Sep-17,"When watching the Netflix adaptation of the famous manga, one has to keep in mind that it will not be like the anime adaptation at all. The anime might be viewed as the perfect adaptation of the manga, so of course expectations might not be the highest when going to view this film. Do keep in mind then that this is hours of anime jammed into 1,5 hours, and that things do have to change drastically for the story to fold out smoothly.The characters bear similarities in names, and sometimes in characteristics. The intentions of the characters are rather changed, which gives a new take on this story which battles morality and what would be the lesser of two evils. Giving ""Mia"" (Misa Amane in the original work) more of a will power to keep on being Kira drives the story, which makes it possible to get a proper conflict in this short of amount of time. In fact, Mia drove many actions that resemble some of the great and many conflicts one sees in the anime that eventually leads up to the great ending. Her will to keep her and Light safe makes her kill some FBI-agents, which is not what Light would do in this film. Of course in the anime, he does this, but in a different situation and with different intentions and so on. It is quite wise that they made ""Light Turner"" more of a lovable character (with a stronger morality compass than ""Light Yagami"") in this film, as audiences have less time to decide whether they root for Kira or not. I could go on about how changing the character's motivations and personalities are there to fuel the story, but I believe I've said enough regarding this.Changing the setting and ethnicities of the characters is a genius move. Since the story is not supposed to be the exact same as the manga, changing both the setting and the character's background gives a breath of fresh air. In a new setting, one can expect new influences, and it's quite fun to see how this would have played out in the USA, and not in Japan (though that is another good story). I absolutely adored Lakeith Stanfield's ""L"". When portraying such an iconic character, I find it very wise to come from a new angle, and not try to do an exact copy of the already known character. This L also showed a different personality, as if making up for the missing ""Mello"" and ""Near""from the original manga.This is not a book-to-screen adaptations but rather something that draws inspiration from the manga. It is not supposed to be the same, and the anime is already such a great making of the manga, that do we really need the exact same thing again? This film had new conflicts that made sense for new viewers, and that were unpredictable to those who know the manga.Of course this is not an Oscar winning piece, but it is a very good work in itself, especially thinking about how they were able to make this story work in such a short period of time. Stop comparing this to the anime, it is a great film!"
accounts-43058,this is not a reinvention,01/10,26-Aug-17,"this is an insult to the original series in so many ways ... a love affair ? romantic Yagami ?

cteavin-1,This version is worth watching in order to compare it to the original film,04/10,25-Aug-17,"I live in Japan and have been a huge fan of the series since it was made into an anime years and years ago. What the anime (and manga) can do that neither movie can is pace the story. The original Japanese Death Note film was rushed but this new America remake was contorted to fit it's just over 90-minute run time. If you don't know, Death Note is about a young man who receives a ""magic"" book that will kill anyone's name written into it. What the original manga and anime are able to do is explore the public's relationship with the person behind the killings and debate their morality. Neither movie could do that, the American movie much, much less so. This new American retelling went for style over plot. There is a lot of work on the cinematography at the expense of what makes the Death Note so compelling. Worse still, they edited in mainstream music during key emotional scenes. The lyrics are meant to convey what the characters are feeling but they are distracting and clearly there to help abbreviate the narrative and punctuate a scene -- it's bad visual and sound editing. The plus is that they departed from the main narrative, so even I was surprised at where the story was headed. They also give background information on the character L, something you don't get until the third stand-alone film in the Japanese franchise. Because they chose an African-American L and a Caucasian Light, they could have nuanced the story with the racial tensions in the US to give it a reason to be told in America. They could have spent time exploring the theme of justice. They could have taken a lot of different threads to make this version of Death Note a story that needed to be told. Instead, the American Death Note is a cool lesson in cultural differences between Japanese and American storytelling. Watch it but be sure to watch either the original Japanese movie or the original anime -- if you can read the manga, it's a truly wild ride."
star_hazard,"Should've made it into a mini, 4 episode series instead",04/10,16-Mar-22,"I've only ever watched the Death Note Japanese Live Action so I know about what to expect but I didn't watch this to compare.I actually love the concept of DN when I first watched the Japanese LA but just didn't get into the anime. I went into this already read the reviews so my expectations were low.Honestly... it's quite deserving of the current score it has which is also what I've given, a 4. The acting wasn't all award winning but there were some casts who were ok. The dad is my favorite part. Willem is also fine as Ryuk but his CGI counterpart not so much. The main problem I had with this is the feeling of disconnect with the main characters... there was just something off about Light and L and even Mia. Like they have no personality aside from the trope they are playing. I also didn't appreciate how edgy they were and that it centered more on their non-existent love for each other. It was honestly to the point of funny. The two had 0 chemistry. Meanwhile L... he was... just. I just want to erase him. Sorry for the actor but it's a big fat no.This would've been better, maybe, if they actually did something to flesh out the characters and do a slower burn of the plot instead of shoving it. Sure the Japanese LA was great in its format but this version was trying to be an American version so the overall vibe and culture will also be different.Overall not something I'd recommend. Just go watch the Japanese LA or series or the anime source if you want to see the concept of DN."

Ginnysababe,How to watch Death Note (2017) when you love the anime.,08/10,25-Aug-17,"""How can they turn 37 episodes into a one hour and 40 minute long film?""Good question! They can't. This is an adaption. Watching this film requires you to accept that it's not going to be able to deliver on everything the anime/manga delivered on.Go in understanding that a lot of elements will be different.You are setting yourself up for failure when you have unrealistic expectations.I thought it was pretty enjoyable, and really well made.

daniel-66187,This is better than the score shows,07/10,02-Jan-23,"I do not watch anime (I do not even like it) so I watched this movie for what it was. An entertaining thriller. I get the Final Destination vibe - and I found it to be thrilling and with good acting and exciting plot.It is somewhat annoying that people cannot just see the movie for what it is instead of comparing it to some, in this case, irrelevant anime. Maybe it is the same people who hate Harry Potter, Ghost in the Shell, Tolien movies etc. Because the book was better or the movie just did not follow everything as the book tells it? If you liked Final Destination, you will probably like this one as well.I recommend it - and ignore the obvious troll-reviews.

bombersflyup,Nat Wolff - Hair dye poisoning.,01/10,26-Nov-19,"Death Note is fanboy comic book trash, that doesn't work in any way at all.From the book just falling to Light, to him sitting reading near the cheerleaders all the time and then being approached by the most attractive one, to the L genius who tries to catch him, to the stupid hair dye and everything in between. Nat Wolff's woeful."
krjgrjgkrjtre,Unadulterated garbage,01/10,27-Aug-17,"The only possible reason to bother watching this is if you actively enjoy getting angry. A combination of abysmal one-liners and poor directorial decisions are an almost welcome distraction from the utter disservice the adaptation does to the plot. Light ""Turner"" is no more the arrogant, sociopathic, charming genius who decides he is rightfully bestowed with the power over life and death. Rather, he is a lonely outsider, goaded and egged on by people who appear to hold a degree of power over him. Just watch the anime, and pretend this never existed.

noorutin,"Stupid, forgettable mess for teens",01/10,26-Aug-17,"I went into this one with an open mind... but honestly, it's just really bad. I'm trying to look at this objectively, and think whether I'd like it on its own merits even if I'd never seen the anime - which I have, multiple times. And the answer is no. This movie is one hundred percent forgettable, worthless teen drama that could have been made with any other premise. It's a total waste of source material, and your time. The movie opens somewhat promisingly, but by midway it has nothing to do with the original story anymore, and it just gets.. so.. stupid from there.Good things: Willem Dafoe's voice fits Ryuk perfectly. Score by Atticus Ross. I kind of liked L's actor. Bad: Everyone who went along with this travesty, and especially the writers.Bottom line: Death Note (2006) is an internationally acclaimed, intelligent, thoughtful thriller anime series. It's an excellent blend of human drama, action, investigation, mindgames and philosophy. Go watch it and forget this trash."
CarmenSandiegoIII,The worst adaptation taken from an anime series that I've ever seen,01/10,26-Aug-17,"Probably the worst adaptation taken from an anime series that I've ever seen -- I'm betting the director didn't watch the full original series. That's fine, but they shouldn't have called this Death Note because it's completely different from the anime series that die hard fans have come to love and were expecting with the live adaptation. The writing is horrible, the acting is poor and rushed and the characters aren't believable. I'd have less of an issue of the story taking place in America if the plot was somewhat interesting. This wasn't Death Note, it was more like Final Destination 6.

Trupiaar,No Substance,01/10,26-Aug-17,"I expect this kind of thing from Disney these days: Take awesome media production, strip it of every important concept and all soul, and then make a bunch of money on T-Shirts for a couple of months.Shame on you Netflix.This was clearly written by someone who just isn't a Death Note fan, and it shows all over the place. Much of the weight of the story was dispelled. Of course, the executive who put this together and thinks it's not important to have a non-hack writer is ultimately to blame though. No, you cannot paint pictures of characters we like that have nothing to do with the original characters we loved and expect success. It is truly an insult to intelligence. I repeat, this kind of thing is an insult to the intelligence of every viewer.All of the moral responsibility is stripped from Light throughout the movie: it's his girlfriend's fault, the bully's fault, Ryuk made him do it... etc. In the original, Light makes all these choices on his own, and this really makes it entirely a different story from the clichéd piece of garbage we witnessed here.Light had no personal motivation for what he did in source material. He was disgusted with the moral-faking turds of society, and Ryuk was BORED. Ryuk never wanted to make anything happen, he wanted to SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. They are SO different.I don't understand why these huge companies give huge paychecks to executives, writers, and directors that can't even bother to get familiar with the content they are working with. It's INSULTING.Only reason I didn't hit the white-washing issue is because it's just too much a slow moving target, it's so obvious it doesn't need to be discussed.Actors did well, it's just not Death Note. Netflix, do us all a favor, next time you want to take some source material for a movie, just hire the guy or gal who wrote the dang original, stop wasting everyone's time, money, and excitement."
Nconiendo,For a particular taste,10/10,29-Aug-17,"I loved it and can tell you I am a huge fan of the movies Mama, Orphan, HoneyBee and Skeleton Key. This feels like it could be related to HoneyBee or It Follows, so if you like dark 80s vibes and soundtracks and teen angst and drama with some added gore you will absolutely enjoy this movie. Trust me that the trailer was terrible for this and the movie itself is so much better than the trailer.

jackmeat,Hard not to compare to the reason the original is good,03/10,26-Aug-17,"My quick rating - 3,2/10. Try as I could, it was hard not to compare this to the source material. But taking that out of the equation, this really just wasn't very good. The concept is very solid, but it has been for over a decade, and has been done better. The actors in this do a really poor job, aside from the spot on perfect voice for Ryuk. Willem Dafoe is always money in the bank, but considering his CGI presence and infrequent usage, that won't help this mess. The whole movie seemed to take the source, and incorporate all the news of bullying, political unrest, etc. and wrap it all up in an hour and a half. Along the way, mix in a romance, and teen angst, and the whole thing just misses so much of what made the original that good. Like I said, hard to not compare. The flaws really don't end there, as the camera work during some scenes was terrible, and the use of pointless slow mo to make a statement got distracting. Overall, sure, it was on netflix, but it seems there movies have been lacking as of late and I think this would've been a better move into a TV series realm, as the story itself lends plenty of expand-ability to it. Oh well, they tried."
lennieh,Pleasant surprise,10/10,25-Aug-17,"Okay I have been a death note fan for years, it was the first manga I ever read and the first Anime (if you don't count Marine Boy) I ever saw and started my passionate love of Japanese cinema, print media and TV.For years there has been talk of a Death Note live action western remake and I have dreaded it. From the nightmare of a Zac Efron film, to any number of other terrible ideas and rumours.Then came the truth that there was to be a Netflix TV movie.Now we have had the Anime, the three Japanese live action films, the Japanese TV series, the relight re-cuts and so on and so forth.I really did not think they could do something new with another adaptation, and then I saw Willem Dafoe was going to play Ryuk and I knew whoever was helming this, KNEW what they were doing.special shout outs to Willem Dafoe Shea Whigham Paul NakauchiAlso watch out for the subtle Easter eggs and shout outs to the earlier versions.WARNING POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS AHEADIn a touch of inspired brilliance the characters and backstories of Light and Misa are switched, with her becoming the power mad psychotic and he becoming the gullible follower.Ryuk becomes far more sinister and downright malicious, Light's father is given a much more prominent role only L stays basically the same character, but is out of place and suffers prejudice in a right wing USA that utterly embraces Kira as a welcome god of death.Unlike in the original were the Kira task force is reduced by fear, here the task force is reduced to one, because the Police LIKE kira and don't want him caught.The lone liberal detective Turner is the only one to assume killing is wrong and deserves the forces of Justice.It is on the whole a fresh twist, westernised with care, on the source material, an alternate take and culture shock variation.To be honest I loved it."
olfrilly,Death Note is a fantastic movie...but fails in its adaptation,07/10,25-Aug-17,"The Death Note film itself, is legitimately very good. The cinematography is something to behold. And the music, my lord the music, is jaw droppingly good at times. As far as acting goes, that's where it gets a bit interesting. Our lead, Nat Wolff is by all means a talented actor. And I've seen several films with him in it, but in this, he fell flat. And his performance is by far the WORST part of this film. That being said Paul Nakauchi, Willem DaFoe, Shea Whigham, and Margaret Qually all did absolutely superb in their acting. But, Keith Stanfield, deserves an award for his performance as L. He nails the mannerisms down perfectly, even his tone of voice sound eerily similar to the English dub of the anime series. As far as the script goes, it needed a little bit of work. At times it could be very cheesy, then at other times it was convincingly good. Netflix's Death Note is more than just a cash grab. You can tell time, effort, and even some love was put into its creation. Adam Wingard is clearly proud of his production, as he should be. This movie is pretty solid. Landing for me, a 6.5/10 - 7/10 If you are a true fan of the Death Note series or never heard of it before, this movie is 100% for you. But if you're an internet troll that doesn't understand art and the difference between a retelling and an adaptation, then this movie is probably not for you."
cesbel,It is watchable.,07/10,25-Aug-17,"I understand this movie is an adaptation of a manga/anime series that is considered to be one of the best in the genre, and I am a huge fan of the anime. However, I would see very difficult to achieve the genius of a series in just 1:40 hours of the movie. Also, this is a movie adaptation, there are different live-action adaptations with Japanese actors that are probably closer tho the manga. As a Hollywood adaptation I considered the movie to be watchable and it does not deserve all the negatives reviews that is receiving. A movie adaptation does not have to be 100% the story in the manga, It will be boring if they try to condensate the whole sequence of the story in a normal time frame for a movie, I think the twist to the story keep me waiting for the next thing to happen.

They have changed so much from the original and ever one of these changes makes it worse. I will not do any spoilers of the plot. All I will say is it is nowhere near as good. All they had to do was condense the original story and change the names and places from Japanese to American. My main issues are with the way they have changed the characters. None of the characters look the way they should and more importantly their personalities are different. Light should have a classically handsome face and dark red hair. He is a genius with a natural cool who always says and does exactly the right thing. This is what makes him so formidable and is why no one ever suspects him of being Kira. In this he is a weird looking temperamental emo kid. L is my favourite character in the original. He should have cool long black hair, pale skin and wise haunted eyes. He has an incredible mind, a strong sense of justice and a whimsical sense of humour. He is the perfect match for Kira. In this they cast a black man for no real reason other than to cast a black man and the character is kind of boring. In the original, Ryuk was a far more complex character. At times he was sinister and cryptic. Other times he was friendly and funny. Overall, he was bored and so dropped the Death Note in the hoping that it would entertain him. In this he is almost a one dimensional moustache twirling cartoon villain. The CGI also looks like it is from the 80's. In the original Misa is adorable. She is sweet and kind. She can also be childish and at times misguided. In this she is just a hot girl with the personality of a cardboard box. Ultimately, I still liked the film enough to hate watch it, but, it is not even close to being as good as the original. It had so much potential too. If you haven't seen the original, you should definitely watch that first. There are just enough similarities that watching this first could ruin some plot points if you decided to watch the original after this. If you liked the original and also kind of enjoy being a critical nerd sometimes, you might enjoy this. Remember 'God's of Death love Apples =]"
deenap4-211-59987,Loved but don't watch if you already know the story,09/10,07-Feb-21,"I love all things sci-fi, horror, mystery, psych thriller, etc. I loved this movie. I expected it to be another mediocre random Netflix movie but I was pleasantly surprised. I saw the trailer and thought it would be an updated babadook-type movie. Death god, book of names, owner chooses whose name goes in the book and the death god kills them. I was in but my expectations were low. The movie had just the right amount of gore (minimal but realistic) and kept me interested all the way thru. I was so surprised at how good it was that halfway thru I googled it to see the ratings. I expected them to be high but was surprised to see how low the ratings were. I realized most of the low ratings came from people that knew the story from manga, anime, Japanese movies, etc. So if you know the story, don't watch this with high expectations as it seems like you won't like it. If you've never heard of the story but the plot interests you, I suggest you watch it! I'm a fan!

arthur_q,Total waste of time.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I've never written a comment on a movie before, but for this one, I've made it personal. This is the worst film adaptation of something I've seen. Total loss of time. The actors act really bad, the history was totally messed up and, finally, the investigation and manipulation sensation which the anime makes you feel, was gone.

sara-rn,As a movie it's bad. As an adaptation it's worse.,04/10,26-Aug-17,"If you go into this movie without knowing the source material you will get a rushed experience, with bland characters, 80s ballads, badly played mind games and a really lame climax. It just feels very incomplete as a movie experience and I wouldn't recommend it.Fans of the source material will get an extremely shallow version of everything death note is. I won't blame it on the actors, but whoever thought bringing such a weak story devoid of any depth and development to the screens was a good idea. This would've worked better as a series and not a movie, perhaps then I would've given this a 7 if the characters were better presented and developed. But this is an insult to both fans and newcomers' intellects.

I for one think it was a great adaptation for international audiences.This movie was a thrill ride from start to finish with a killer soundtrack to go along with it and I recommend it to anyone wanting to spend an entertaining hour and a half.

gnakyjacky,Whitewashed movie fails to ever meet the high standards the original series set,02/10,27-Aug-17,"If you're looking for Light Yagami from the anime, you actually find more of him in Misa (Mia) than Light Turner himself. (Why do they even change the names.) As Mia said in the movie, Light Turner is a pu**y and quite frankly, a butcher of the original character. This movie has nothing going for it except for L. The actor who played L was the saving grace for this movie. He actually seemed to research his character before attempting to play it. While the director may be in control with how the movie was carried out, it easily could be seen that L's character was the only thing truly preserved. His eccentric character, body language, love of candy, back story, THE MIC TAP, and investigative abilities were spot on. On the other hand, his character, unfortunately, did take an emotional turn when L was heavily impacted by Watari's death. While this was different from the anime, it wasn't crucial to the plot and I believe it's perfectly acceptable for a director to stray from the original series. To delve into the endless, horrendous aspects of this movie, I read a review before watching, mocking the selection of 80s synth music. And I thought, ""How bad could that be?"" I really should have listened to that review because the music choice was simply god-awful. Sometimes it ruined the tone of a scene that would've been fine otherwise. For example, terrible cheesy romantic music was played during Mia's death scene. To continue... Before around the time L was introduced, the bonds between the main characters (i.e. Light, father, dead mother, and Mia) were more shallow than how deep Light fell into the water (come on guys, it should've been deeper than that). The lines exchanged the characters were succinct and pointless. For example, in a dinner scene between Light and his father, the lines exchanged reminded me of the typical attitude an angtsy American teenager throws at his/her parents. This movie truly whitewashed the original series by replacing the Japanese culture and concepts into American culture, not even transitioning the series well. Misa in the anime was a blond headed girl who was happy, eccentric and wore unique outfits to reflect her character. Meanwhile, Mia in the movie was a cheerleader, smoked cigarettes, and was extremely edgy without much character development. Next, Light Turner's mother died and because of it, he acts out in several ways, including angrily pushing books off his desk, making cringy yet hilarious faces, and blaming his father's inability to catch her killer for everything. In the anime, Light still has his mother and his family isn't even involved nor is he angry. I'm not sure if that's an Asian thing, but I sure as hell prefer it. In this movie, Ryuk was portrayed more as a demon rather than a proper death god as seen in Japanese mythology. It is seen here that in American horror culture insists that anything seen as relatively demonic must be evil, must be the bad guy, and definitely must eat apples like a human would (HE EATS THEM CLEANLY IN THE ANIME). Lastly, the theme of the anime was not carried over. In the anime, Light Yagami was an individual seeking justice in a calm and collected manner. He killed simply because he thought he was doing the world a favor by ridding it of its scum. On the contrary, Light Turner was a coward character and purpose-wise. He was painted as an immature teenager who had the ability to kill criminals simply because he could. In conclusion, I believe that they could have done so much better with the budget of $40 million when Orange is the New Black could have made the same amount of screen time with $8 million."
pazu7,Why did they bother?,03/10,02-Sep-17,"Why bother? If they were just going to destroy the story... then why bother? I was really excited for an American redo. I had high hopes when I heard who was doing it. But now I can only ask myself, why? Shaving this complicated story down to one film was a danger sign, but I figured they would find a way to make it work. And for the first 20 minutes or so I was rolling with the changes. I wanted to give it a chance. But in the end, more time was spent on an over- the-top ridiculous chase scene than was spent on Kira's critical rise to power. Death Note isn't an action film. It's a thinking story. It's a labyrinth. It's a complex tale about a genius detective and an elusive criminal trying to outsmart one and other. The thrills come from the tense relationship between L and Kira not from some bloated and trite chase scene. Hate to say it but this was a failure. The actors did a good enough job. If they'd had a better script they wouldn't be getting so much hate. And they destroyed Ryuk. It isn't evil, as portrayed in this. None of the shinigami are really evil, they're just not concerned with the moral prerogatives of mortals. That complexity was ruined along with so much of the other nuance in the original. Don't mess with the classics if you're not gonna take the time to do them right. Please."
anime-cool,Not good compared to the anime,01/10,25-Aug-17,"The movie does not do justice to the manga or the anime.Ever the character seems to be completely new in the movie even though the names are the same. there is so much more to Kira, Light, and L and the battle they go through. Being a big anime fan. especially of Death Note, this movie was a disappointment."
MrDHWong,Do yourself a favour and watch the original anime instead.,03/10,30-Aug-17,"Death Note is a Western adaptation of the Japanese manga/anime of the same name. Taken on its own, this is merely a mediocre crime thriller but when compared to the masterpiece that is the original, it is another failed adaptation and further proof that the West has never and likely will never be able to successfully adapt any form of Japanese media.Light Turner (Nat Wolff), an intelligent social outcast, stumbles upon a mysterious notebook known as the ""Death Note"". Light soon learns from its Death God creator Ryuk (voiced by Willem Dafoe), that it has the power to kill any person by having their name written in it, so long as the writer knows the victim's real name or face. With this in mind, Light decides to become a vigilante and clean up the world of who he perceives to be evil and make it a better place. Eventually, a famous detective known only as L (Lakeith Stanfield), is hot on Light's tail and pursues him to try and bring him to justice.The main problem I have with the film is not the alleged whitewashing of its cast or that it gets just about everything wrong with the characterisation of Light, L, and Mia (Misa in the original story). Its primary issue is that it tries to cram material from 108 chapters of the manga and 37 episodes of the anime into a measly 100 minutes. This adaptation may have worked slightly better had it been a 13 episode miniseries rather than a feature length film. Granted, it is not as boring as Ghost In The Shell or as outright silly as Dragonball Evolution but it still feels just insulting to its source material. In the original story, Light is popular, intelligent, and an honour student with a god complex whereas in this film he's a generic social outcast with school shooter tendencies. If one were to replace the Death Note with a gun, then this film likely would've been more along the lines of a retelling of Columbine or Sandy Hook. L, who was extremely secretive and introverted in the original is instead making public appearances giving speeches, having photos taken, and shouting in public that he will find who he is looking for. However, as to be expected, Willem Dafoe is appropriately menacing and intimidating as Ryuk, but unfortunately he is underused and hardly has any effect on the plot aside from occasional exposition. I said it before with Ghost In The Shell and I will say it again; if this is the future for Western adaptations of anime and manga, then I'm not too excited. Do yourself a favour and watch the original anime instead.I rate it 3/10"

brandon_veracka,I feel like I need a shower.,03/10,25-Aug-17,"I was so excited when this was first announced. I literally marked my calendar, and I feel like such a chump for thinking this would be good. Sadly, this is pure, unadulterated typical Hollywood garbage. Though I'm a huge fan of the original, I'm trying to be as objective as humanly possible here, while trying not to echo the reviews of all the other angry Death Note anime & manga fans—who have every right to be frustrated.This ""remake"" is shallow as a dirty puddle in the street and should be treated as such—walk around it! I'm quite certain that even if had I never seen the original anime, I still would've hated this film. It is so rushed and so under-cooked in every way possible; like one of those bad movie- licensed video games.Firstly, the concept; take a classic anime—based on an amazing manga—with over 14 hours of run time spread out over 37 episodes, and turn it into a 95-minute film. I believe it would've been possible to condense all of that amazing character development, storytelling, and beautiful artwork into a decent film, but not in that run time; certainly not with Captain Bligh on the new ship of fools who is director Adam Wingert and company. Like a bad fart in the theater, this absolutely terrible Hollywood cheese cannot be ignored. Death Note the ""film"" has that typically high-polish, low substance, garbage-quality that nearly every American movie has had for a decade. We've all heard that saying, ""You can't shine sh*t."", and nowhere is that more recently apparent than here.All of the typical tropes of bad Hollywood ""thrillers"" are here; poor character development, lackluster cinematography, pacing at a break-neck speed, a forgettable and inappropriate soundtrack, poor use of sexuality, etc., etc. Poor character development is front & center, and is particularly noticeable because this is (or was) a story about a single person's innermost struggles against right and wrong. The introduction of a second protagonist character, Mia, was done haphazardly and in such poor taste. There seems to be no reason for this character to exist in the form that she does. While not terribly acted, the writing of the character Mia is awful at best.Speaking of bad writing, our main character ""Light"" was opaque and one- dimensional. The choice of actor was not bad, his acting wasn't good or bad, but the writing was terrible. A massive wag of the (middle) finger to the jobs of all three—director, producer, and writer. The ONLY thing worth mentioning is the live action version of Ryuk, which of course Willem Dafoe did the best he could with. However no amount of his charm could cover-up the blaring siren of disaster that is this terrible movie. I've never seen such wanton destruction of such a great story in my life.3 out of 10 for 30% effort on the part of the crew and 70% trash ready for pickup."
nicovanbelle,Starts off bad but gets better along the way,06/10,11-May-21,"The first 30 minutes of the movie were not the best. I wasn't too sure if I'd continue to watch it to the end but I did anyway. After a while, the director gets his groove back and the movie turns into something more interesting. I cannot say the script follows the series but that's fine. Watching a real-life adoption of the manga will make it only worse so adaptions to the script should have been made nonetheless. L was still a bit too comic book for my taste. You can go full awkward in a manga or cartoon without if becoming a distraction from the rest but in a movie those things just don't work.Overall not the best movie but definitely not the worst either.

edogruca-47840,One more bad live action,03/10,25-Aug-17,"Here we go again! Everybody knows that live action versions of the most animes suck. I am gonna put some spoilers on this and gonna compare it with the original content. First of all main character(light) is not smart at all. He is just a normal high school student which is maybe studies a lot. He shares the book with the pretty girl he likes at the beginning of the movie to impress the girl, as we expect from a classic American story. He gets caught so fast that i couldn't believe how stupid could he be.Just go watch the original content because this movie is a teenage story and nothing mind blowing like the original content."
MugseyGrant,Should Have Been Episode Not A Movie,04/10,26-Aug-17,So firstly with anything such as Death Note you of course going to have the original fans such as myself. Who enjoyed the anime and wasn't happy when you heard they was going to make it a movie. Firstly with how much went on in the Anime you could never fit this in a movie why I feel this should have been a series not a film. It's rare you beat an original and I do feel the writers let themselves down and should have stayed with the rules of the book the new rules ruined the film. If your a fan of the Anime get ready to feel like you've been let down. The story still had its clever twist and we are limited by how much we see Ryku in the film. The relationship of Light and Mia was something similar of a Joker and Harley Quinn relationship it was stupid and ruined the story. The good things might have been the clever twist and I feel Willem Dafoe saved this film being much worst than it was the writers should have written there own names in the book and killed off the whole cast in 48 hours. Would I recommend this to someone who loved the Anime nope I wouldn't the same with anyone who not watched the Anime I save them from a horrible nightmare. It's not often I give a film 4 stars but i feel even a smaller time directed could have done a better job than this rubbish.
leeleejensen,Better than expected,07/10,11-Jan-19,"As someone who had never seen the anime under the same name, I went into Death Note with open expectations. What I got was an entertaining thriller with an intriguing plot that never gets too drawn into being too serious. To put it simply, the movie was dumb fun. The acting was surprisingly good and the main character, Light, was a likeable and relatable protagonist. If you feel like turning your brain off and watching a gory action film, this film will be fine.

lordblacknemp,"Like film, it complies; As adaptation, disappoint.",06/10,26-Aug-17,"I must say that as an individual film is good and entertaining, although the special effects of Ryuk did not convince me much, and certainly the performances left something to be desired.Now, as the anime adaptation (which is the only Death Note I saw), I was not convinced. The anime that I saw, although part of a magical base (an account ending, is a guy who kills people writing in a notebook), the center of the story was the plot to ""Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Moriarty "", The Intelligence Struggle and detectives between"" L ""and"" Kira "", the first to catch the second. It came to such a degree that you forgot any hint of magic, and you focused on the intellectual duel of both. The adaptation of Netflix has some of that, but they lose in a great sense, to give us a plot that entertains but is below the anime.I give it a 6 out of 10. If you do not know anything about Death Note, you'll have fun; If you know the history of Death Note, feelings that became a plot with a great intellectual duo and a digestible for the general public."
JRNewts,Everyone needs to just relax!,05/10,25-Aug-17,"First off, out of the hundreds even thousands of anime's I have watched, Death Note is easily in my top 3! It was 37 episodes of pure intense drama, story telling and moral dilemmas. But unfortunately the movie just doesn't quite land on the same page.... pun intended.But I am not here to just complain, I am here to offer my informative opinions on how Hollywood could have saved this mess. 1. Turn it into a TV series. 2. Make Nat Wolff a new character. 3. Nat is the next person to receive DN after Light Yagami, this would help explain why he's a white American kid. 4. Fill the TV show with references to the anime show. Eg, See Light and his entries names on the final pages. 5. Not have him (For the beginning) not so easily manipulated by a girl. It was pretty clear she was getting her jollies by names going in and he was blind to it.Now, I have been speaking as someone who is referencing the show. Now if I was a new viewer having never seen the anime, I actually think the movie is alright, even as a standalone there is a lot to be desired. Hence the 5/10.But overall it's just another reason why these half ass directors shouldn't be allow to touch high end shows without the guidance of professionals. I mean this marks the 6th or something terrible Death Note movie attempt and I am sure it wont be the last."
watch_or_not,Death Note... Who's name would you write down...?,08/10,25-Aug-17,"So first of all, I don't think I'm alone when I say, I don't care about the anime, source material that the story came from or the fact it's not an exact duplicate of the Japanese movies, why make the same movie again? (*cough REC / Quarantine *cough). I had never seen or heard of any of them before watching this version, so coming from an unbiased perspective, the movie was great! Acting was solid, it looked fantastic and the story, although at the start felt a little rushed, if you have half a brain you don't need 30mins of character development to get a movie such as this moving along. Willem Dafoe still, has never done wrong by me.. I always enjoy watching anything he does, even if it's only lending his voice this time around. I'm not going to rewrite the script on here and claim it as a ""review"" I'm simply going to give my recommendation to give Death Note a watch. Forget the haters who want to try and relate everything back to the original material (they are still residing in their mothers basements). Death Note is a new take on the story for a completely different audience, and they absolutely succeeded in doing so. Do yourself a favour and watch it, even if it's only for Dafoe. Who's name would you write down?"
vicstevinson,"Loses its sense of humor, Lakeith Stanfield overplays",04/10,26-Aug-17,"This film starts out with a great sense of humor. Nat Wolff delivers an excellent start and Ryuk the death monster has a great touch of camp. Unfortunately the film begins to take itself seriously and then takes a serious dive when Lakeith Stanfield enters the picture. Everything he does is surface intensity: bulging eyes, hands jamming into bowls of candy sending mess everywhere, staccato vocal delivery -- because that's what intensity sounds like.It's a shame this went off the rails.

daisukereds,Easily the worst adaptation,02/10,29-Aug-17,"If you like fan-fiction, you might like this adaptation. Me personally, I can't unsee the source material so I'm unable to appreciate it as I would have liked. In comparison, this feels sub- par, rushed and made for general audiences. It can't encompass all that originally happened in such a short time frame, making it hard for us to love these characters the same way. A one off doesn't work for an epic duel between smart minds with the ""world"" on the balance.As for the film itself (not compared to the manga) : I quite like how the main characters are introduced during the first 2 minutes. You quickly get a sense of their personalities (more Mia than Light), and that was a nice way to start.The story suffers a bit, but it is well developed for what it is (meaning, what they decided they wanted it to be). I have issues with Direction and Cinematography, but nothing that would ruin the experience (though not fan of gore, there is one suicide scene that looks ""good""). Then come the ""plot holes"" and conveniences that take away from how smart it tries to be, as well as the weird acting during some scenes.All in all, is another attempt at a remake that wasn't really necessary nor does it add anything. It's fun to make fun of, at least.--- SPOILERS ---I have some personal opinions about the movie..
While I appreciate attention to details and little moments (how Light initially pronounced Ryuk's name only to have him corrected + Or when Light wakes up during detention, and there are marks on his forehead from the book he was sleeping on).. they butchered the story. There's little work or imagination put into this variation, and being a mix of the original and new takes.. it fails at being it's own thing.Specially the way they used the Death Note and it's rules (the framework of story telling here)... It's now able to manipulate events and reality itself, as a consequence of a death cause? Having the page with his name fall and burn was dumb. Or as to why they didn't intervene Light's cellphone when he became the prime suspect? These are scenarios that cause potential problems with the plot that could have been easily fixed by writing them differently, such as Mia burning to death while holding the page. And let's not even consider the fact that a page could have more than ONE name on it, so which one is saved? The first one or one at random? Writers writing themselves into a corner.Anyway..
As for the other characters : It feels strange to have the ""greatest detective"" character (that doesn't really prove himself with anything he does) act the way it does vs how straight everything else is played. His personality is the biggest detriment to the movie. People who haven't seen the source material would probably think that he is weird for weird's sake; a rather emotional person that sits strangely, eats lots of candy and tilts his head rather stupidly. He is rash and a bit crazy for little reason, and acts as if he had nothing to lose or didn't care. It feels like Light himself was also played similarly at points.. such as the picture- taking scene in the dance for no reason, or screaming like a child in an over-the-top manner.This makes Mia, a character that seemed strange from the start and is later played to be sort of mad, the only character left we can relate to.In fact, Mia might be the smartest character from the three, and it is quite sad that she is ""madly in love"" with Light in the end, instead of simply manipulating him throughout.. Would have been more satisfying, specially since you see the treason coming from miles away (having Light antagonize her multiple times, for example). She wants to change the world! She is driven! She takes action and kills innocent people. Even if evil, she has what a main character needs, much like the original Light does.But the tie-in of the relationship between Light and Mia, with killing and what seems to be a sexual relationship on top of it is rather childish. ""I thought we could make some popcorn and take some names down for later"" is more about them than justice and probably aimed at a younger audience, but it is a detriment to what they are doing and sexualizing it belittles the ""love"" they feel for one another (which is already shallow to begin with).The only thing that I quite liked from all this (as it was different and good) is the fact that Light, when confronted by L, makes it seem like he is being implicated or threatened or manipulated (seeming smart for a second).. willing to work with him to prevent the Death Note from being used.I got excited at the idea of both Light and L going against Ryuk, which is much more aggressive in this story. Sadly, it didn't go in any new or interesting direction."

fmb1996,"Oh my god, that was horrible",01/10,27-Aug-17,"OK this one is gonna be short and sweet. That movie was simply horrible. The story is rushed, the main character, who is supposed to be a genius, never stops to be an attention-hungry idiot and all the important parts to understand the story are either omitted or within a montage.Th acting was simply horrible. Nat Wolff goes through the whole movies either like he needs to go to the toilet or simply overacting. Margaret Qualley's character is bad but I feel it is more due to horrible writing than bad acting. The silver lining is however Lakeith Stanfield's L: Good job, you were decent, and judging by the performances around you, you must be an incredible actor to pull that off.Conclusion, do not watch it, it is jut a waste of time.

jonathandmacdonald,Enjoyable,08/10,02-Feb-21,"The poor ratings seem to be from people who have seen other Death Note films or series. As someone who had never heard of it before this film, I do not see what the problem is. I found the film very enjoyable and well-made, with a good plot that gave plenty of surprises.

SickBoyGoreHound,Why a movie?,04/10,25-Aug-17,"Why a movie, Netflix? Why not a series? Because, now, we got events -- that should've been epic and have a build up to them -- crammed into 4 minutes and, instead of epic and dramatic, they end up feeling forced and rushed. We got characters development that should've happened during those events and is completely missing. Now there are conflicts that don't pay off because they aren't even established to begin with (and yet they're in the movie because they're central to the story). More than the first half hour of this thing feels like a TRAILER: that's how quick it has to go through a HUGE part of the story.""Kid finds a book that kills people"" is a stupid premise. It's cool, it has potential, but it's stupid. It only worked in the original series because they took the TIME to make it work. To set up the scale, rise the stakes, flesh out the characters and had it all payoff. You can't do that in a movie that's 100 minutes including opening logos and closing credits (there are less than 93 minutes of actual movie). And, granted, the original series had a LOT of filler (like a lot of anime series do): trimming out the fat, even 6-to-8 1h episodes live action miniseries would've been perfectly fine to adapt it.Worst thing, though? There's a lot of (potentially) good stuff, in this version - mostly the stuff that has been changed or added to the original narrative - and when it does slow down the pace and take its time to do its own thing it actually works... except, here we are with the same problem again: there isn't enough time for it to properly do its own thing and everything feels crammed. The visual style is good. The leading couple has a little too much of a discount-Twilight feeling to them, but that even kind-of-works, within context. The cast, as a whole, isn't bad either. There are some good performances and, with the right format, the actors could've grown into these characters.4/10, because eventually it tries to be its own thing, which is great but, overall, it's a mess.P.S. And why the hell is there a blooper/green screen reel edited in the stylized credits? WTF it has to do with anything?"
ttitlrp,Not worth the time,01/10,25-Aug-17,"Now, I'll start this by saying I have watched the Anime and the Japanese film adaptation, as well as reading the Manga's. I have been a fan of death note for at least 10 years and it has always stood out for me as being one of the better mystery/thriller/horror anime's that I have seen. The Japanese movie did a pretty good job of portraying the main first story line and honestly i think this movie would have done better if they hadn't gone for a remake of light's Kira, but rather Teru Mikami, the 4th Kira. The reason i say this is, if you aren't going to do L and Light justice, which they haven't, go for a set of characters that haven't been portrayed in a live action movie, like Teru, Near and Mello (english pronunciations) It would have given current fans of death note something new, and also given the directors of this movie room to breathe, as they wouldn't have had their movie compared to the Japanese works.TL;DR - It sucked whether you're a fan of the anime or not.Below here there could be spoilers. Actually, there are definitely spoilers.On to the issues -Character portrayal- L - Just.. What. What the actual hell. This portrayal of the mastermind detective, L was just.. wrong. The ONLY thing they got right was his love of sweet things. L does not go into a blind rage. L is methodical and clever, playing a game of chess, basically. This portrayal showed a ""hey i lived in a strange place to train to be the world's greatest detective and i'm going to spend an hour getting angry at everyone, okay?"" version, which is just... wrong. Everything that was intriguing about the character was removed.Light- Light was far more methodical in the manga/anime/live action movie. He was cold and calculating. He wrote the names of the detectives in the death note, not ""mia"". He was also much more of a sociopath than this, far more twisted. Its obvious they 'toned it down' but honestly it just made light look weak and pathetic. From the get go he didn't flinch when he killed people, neve rmind scream like a frightened 6 year old. Sociopaths do not have the emotional range to react like that. I'm sorry but this was just bad. Also, as a standalone, the actor they used to play him was just not right for the role. His acting was sub-par.Mia- (Supposed to be a stand in for Misa) Was just acted poorly. She actually acted how LIGHT was supposed to act. Mia(Misa) should have been the one to scream and cry. She was head over heels in love with Light, obsessed with Kira before she met him. This whole thing was just a mess. Honestly they could have made a movie about Misa as the death note owner, showing her actual story, would have been cool, but i guess America just isn't ready to do something where the love interest doesn't die, despite the fact that she could have been great for a second movie.Ryuk - This is the only character they mostly got right. Ryuk is just an assPlot issues- The plot to this was just... weak. From the first kill to the last, the pacing was off, the timing was wrong, the deaths were a mess and half of the plot didn't need to be in there and the time could have been used to do something far more interesting.Special Mentions - The ""orphanage"" also known as ""wammy's house"" in the manga. It was nice they put that in there, but it just wasn't explained. it was just randomly thrown in, i watched this with my brother and towards the end these were his exact words ""so.... he's a ninja detective who was trained in a house of horrors?"" which... if you read the manga, just isn't right. This bit really made my blood boil. If you're going to introduce a plot point you should really resolve it before the movie ends. The amount of cliffhangers in this movie is unnecessary and I think they are banking on good reviews to make a second one... And honestly I don't think it's going to get enough to warrant a second movie.Actual Film - The camera angles were awkward, the lighting was bad, the sound kept fluctuating so I had to keep turning it up and then down, the atmosphere they tried to create fell limp and you just kind of felt you were watching some kind of teenage romance movie where people got killed now and again. Overall it lacked quality and plot, i had paused it several times and it actually took me nearly 4 hours to finish it because there were more exciting things to watch on Youtube.I'm not going to touch the casting problems that people have mentioned... I do have an issue with where it was placed, the name changes, the choice of actors and the nationality of them, but only because they're trying to detach this from the anime/manga/live action film so much that they've hacked it up into something ugly and unrecognizable. It shouldn't even be called death note, that's how separate it is from the original works. It's a shame, honestly."
FelicitySplecidy,Meh,02/10,25-Aug-17,"If you have seen the anime version, don't go into this film thinking you will get to see the brilliant cat and mouse mental game that L and Light play in the series. Light is not even that devious or manipulative or smart for that matter. It is very disappointing. L is not as weird or cooky...I think they chose the wrong actor for him. I also wish they had shown more of their relationship played out because although L and Light did not like each other, they had a great love and respect for each other's mental game which was failed to be shown in the film.And as for Mia, I liked that they didn't portray her as this dumb blond who only wants to serve and be with Light (she wants to actually be Kira in this), but I wish they would have made her have a death note as well like in the anime. That was one of the main reasons Light got caught and his ultimate downfall. How they spun it in the film was OK but not as brilliant as the series.Also Ryuk wasn't involved at all in Light's decisions. He was an observer but in the film they make him be so much more which I hated. Hopefully they make a remake of this in a few years because this did not do justice for the beloved anime."
john-demetriou-jd,The only thing this Death note killed was Light Yagami,03/10,15-Mar-19,"Seriously, butchered characters, boring acting, nothing worthwhile. Only good thing was Willem Dafoe. But when the directing and script suck, not much he can do

gracefaalk,Horrible,01/10,27-Aug-17,"I don't write reviews but I wanted to just this once to give this movie the sort of review it deserves. I only had to watch the first ten seconds to know I would hate it, and throughout the movie I was reeling with disgust and boredom. Netflix took what was once a compelling, complex, thought-provoking and truly frightening character (Light Yagami) and turned him into some white boy from Seattle who screams like a child. What was an atmospheric scenario with thrilling mystery-horror arches of drama is now just a petty waste of an evening. And everything is white washed to hell. I have no idea why it had to be American- it only served to weaken it's similarity to the original. I hate Netflix."
happycarrot68,Poor remake of an utterly superb creation,03/10,03-Sep-17,"Dubious when I saw yet another US adaptation of a Japanese classic and rightly so. This really lacks everything from the original, interesting, dark characters, the quirky humour and all round feel of the thing. Death Note is such a great creation and those watching this and unaware of it's origins are seriously missing out.Avoid, find the originals and leave this to the 99p bargain DVD bin.

cmommy,Don't waste your time.,01/10,26-Aug-17,"I will be honest, I didn't even finish the movie because it was so awful. After the first three minutes I was ready to change the movie. The acting was so horrible and if that wasn't bad enough the killing was not believable. L and Light are two completely different characters compared to the anime and manga. In this movie, Light is very timid. When he first meet Ryuk he run away screaming, in the anime Light is more composed and calm. Also, there are more rules in the Death Notebook compared to the anime. In the anime if anyone touches the notebook you can see the Shinigami in the movie you could not. In the movie L look more like a ninja in the all black costume. I feel like this movie wasn't fully thought out. The movie was rushed and the director assume he would be making big bucks. I read online that he's getting ready for a part two. Don't waste your time producing another crappy movie, Mr. Director. Give the movie a try and see if you like it, because I didn't."
leosp-29225,Bad adaptation of beloved anime/manga,01/10,14-Jun-22,"I am not a huge anime fan,i watched some anime like Fullmetal Alchemist,One Punch Man and the subject of my review: Death Note. This movie is a "" What if Death Note happened in America"". My biggest problem with this movie was the change in the characters personalities and the way they behave. Instead of being a smart and cold blooded boy,here Light is a whiny,dumb boy. Instead of being calm and smart,L is agressive and makes many dumb decisions. I understand that they wanted to make Misa have a more important role,but it didnt worked. Ryuk was the only good character in the movie,William Dafoe did a great job even with the bad script. Instead of having the mind games of the original anime/manga,here we have a generic police thriller,with many car chases, shooting and explosions. If only they foccused on the mind games and investigation like the original anime/manga,this movie could've have been enjoyable.

The acting is awful at best honestly even i just bothered with if because i saw Willem Dafoe portraying Ryuk but....i seriously an at a loss of words here. The story runs past you so fast that you're not even left wondering rather laughing at the sad attempt to recreate an epic into this.

NewandykeFreddie,Would've Preferred To See This As A Separate Death Note Incident,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I really don't know where to start with this movie.It was supposed to be an American adaptation of a very popular Japanese TV show. It turned out to be, in my opinion at least, a colossal failure. I think the first mistake was making this into a movie. There was too much going on in the minds of and between the characters themselves to fit into one hour and forty minutes. It felt a bit rushed for that reason.The characters were a little too edgy, dumb and emotional. I don't mean these as insults, but I use them in order to show the contrast between them and their Japanese counter-parts. I felt that almost every move was uncalculated and done in a rash manner. Where as the calculated thoughts and actions of the characters in the TV show were the main selling points of the series.But you know what? I don't mind the characters being dumb, or emotional. They're only human. They're also dealing with a book that has the power to kill people! This movie more accurately represented what would probably happen if an average Joe got a hold of the Death Note. In fact, I would've loved to watch a movie about an incident where the Death Note fell into the hands of someone other than Light. A story completely isolated from the original Death Note series. With the exception of Ryuk, of course. Maybe another detective (other than L) could've tackled the task of taking down the killer.Unfortunately, this was not the case. This movie completely abandoned the idea and general vibe of the original anime. The characters that kept us entertained and in suspense were nowhere to be found for that one hour and forty minutes. I feel that it is because of this absence that this movie did not live up to the original series."
saliaga08,Poorly Executed,03/10,03-Sep-17,"Really the film was complete trash because of two reasons. Ryuk and Lights relationship felt completely forgotten in this adaptation. Whereas in the anime/manga they have a fun buddy-buddy but watch your back relationship. Second the rules of the Death Note were changed which in the the Death Note universe is like rewriting the Decalogue of our universe. The biggest rule being ""anyone who touches any part of the Death Note has the ability to see the shinigami."" Which if you have read or seen the anime you would understand the value that rule. Acting wise I like Nat Wolff, Light and Margaret Qualley, Mia although I didn't at first glance.The way Lakeith Stanfield portrayed L was like watching a bollywood actor maybe L was to complex of a character for him. Just feels like they slopped this together and hoped for the best.

DocteurDream,An absolute disregard for the original.I am personally ashamed this movie exists.,02/10,26-Aug-17,"This movie has broken all the rules when it comes to DeathNote. The rules have been changed, the story has been changed and the most important aspect which makes DeathNote stand out for fans i.e., the clever mind games, don't exist in this dumbed down version for western audience. The anime was filled with cliffhangers at each turn, the cat and mouse game grew intense with each time Kira and L met, and that life the anime had is just non existent in this movie. People who made this movie should be ashamed. People who made this movie possible should be ashamed. Its a cheap knock off, and insult to the fans all around the world. If I have to describe it in one word, it would be - Disgusting. Absolutely Disgusting, and terrible.

Netflix took the original story and made a dumb teeny love drama out of it. The characters are so different from the original, it hurts me seeing them like this. Portraying the story a little bit different wouldn't hurt anyone but they have kept like only 20% of it. And these 20% are the base premise the rest is completely made up. I cant really express my feelings about this horrible RL adaptation. At some points you could even think that it is somekind of parody. Just don't watch it.

agustintomaslarghi,The most cringe-worthy film that I ever saw,02/10,26-Aug-17,"I imagine that if you checked this film you had read the manga or watched the anime. If you don't this is going to be even more unwatchable. Let's start with the good things which are fewer than the bad thing.The good things:#1 Willem Dafoe does the voice and face of Ryuk. This is by far the only good thing that the movie has, perfect voice and perfect face for Ryuk.#2 Even though that the name Light Turner sounds awfully weird, in one scene of the movie his father explains that his mother was a hippie and that's possibly why he was called like that. That was a good explanation for something that didn't made any sense.And that's it, I really want to squeeze another good thing, but there's none. Now let's start with the bad things.The bad things:#1 As I said Willem Dafoe did a marvelous job putting the voice and face for Ryuk, but there's one slightly problem, he doesn't get too much screen time, I think that you can barely make 10 minutes of screen time for Ryuk through the film. Another thing is that we never get to see Ryuk 100%, he's always in some dark corner, or hiding behind something, we never get a full body shot of Ryuk, only parts of his face, his silhouette, we only get small glimpses of him and that's all. Total waste of a good face and a good voice.#2 Light, I really liked the idea of Light being more of an introverted kid, not the all-mighty, all-knowing champion that he's in the anime, but the problem here is that he's not just an introverted kid, he's an edgy cringe-worthy teenager. First he's not smart, at all, I mean he literally talks about the Death Note with the first person that saw him reading it. He's not cautious at all, doesn't get any safety measures to protect his secret. He's like the inbreed son of Light Yagami. And don't get me started on the acting, the scene where he first meet Ryuk or the scene where he asks Mia if he can kiss her, are from far, the most cringy things through the film.#3 Mia/Misa, the acting is OK, but the only thing that I didn't like about this character was that she didn't had any true motive to support Kira's killings. I mean, from what I saw in the film, she liked killing criminals just because she enjoyed it. She wasn't grateful to Kira for killing her parents assassin, like in the anime or manga, she just enjoyed it.#4 L, again, the acting of this character is pretty OK, we get a decent glimpse at L's past, he's as eccentric as in the anime or manga (the squatting while sitting was totally off in the film, but well) but there's one major issue, doesn't match the anime personality at all, here L is controlled by his emotions several times and loses his temper, something that the real L would never do.#5 Light's father, in the anime or manga Light's father is a paragon of justice, he resembles what ideally a true policemen should look like, how justice should be delivered, but here he doesn't have those qualities, he just wants to caught Kira because yes, he loses his temper very easily, and the acting seems pretty off.#6 Death note rules, yeah in the anime they had bent the rules a couple of times, in the Japanese live action they bent it event more, but here the rules went completely twisted, you can get someone killed by making other person write in the death note, you can cancel deaths, you can control people before killing them (in the anime you also could, but just a few minutes, here you can control them by over two days before killing them). I guess that when they were writing the script the said:-""Okay, you know what, let's invent a new rule each time that we need to explain or do something""#7 ""Is not an adaptation is based on"", this is something that I have been hearing to defend this poorly written film many times. The character's names are the same, the plot is almost the same, so in my book, this is an adaptation.And that's it. What annoys me more than everything is the fact that they have all the right ingredients to make an awesome film. Ryuk voice and face done by Willem Dafoe, Seattle was a really nice setting to unfold the story, Mia and L's acting was pretty good for an average low bucket film, L's being more temperamental than the anime version was something nice, but well, they said:-""Let's get giggyty wiggidy cringy with this and make some weeaboo film""."
Skaigear,"A cheap Final Destination knockoff, not the cerebral chess game of the original",05/10,04-Sep-17,"Death Note is directed by Adam Wingard based on the anime and manga by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. I have seen the 2006 Japanese live-action film and I thought it was okay. As with most other live-action movies made in Japan, it has an imaginative idea but fails in technical departments like editing, cinematography and special effects. How does this new reincarnation of the beloved anime fare? I liked it about as much as the 2006 film, probably even enjoyed it a tad more, despite its numerous problems. Once again, the best thing about Death Note is its concept: a high school kid called Light learns he can kill anyone, anytime by writing their name on a notebook. Originally only wanted to make the world a better place, he begins to abuse the notebook for his own nefarious gains and to evade his rival, the intelligent detective ""L."" It is story of mental chess games and an interesting study about how absolute power corrupts absolutely. For this review I am going to judge Wingard's film as its own thing, trying to not hold it to the standard of its source material, however one thing I cannot do is sit idly by and pretend Death Note's great original premise was invented by this version.Critiquing it merely as its own entity, the movie is still very middle of the road. It started out great with top-notch cinematography and music choice giving the whole thing a surreal feeling. However right after Light finds the notebook and makes his first kill, which was pretty cool, the film goes downhill from there. Light went from a high school awkward loser to a revered god called Kira with a hot cheerleader girlfriend within four minutes of montage. This is simply unacceptable as even for someone like myself who is not super familiar with the manga knows the transition from Light into Kira is a very important aspect and fast forwarding through it was a huge mistake. The rest of the film is devoted to L attempting to uncover the identity of Kira. While L is supposed to be the greatest detective in the world, some of his actions were pure idiotic and out-of-character. Not to mention many times his deduction skills to reach certain conclusions were far-fetched, contrived and unearned. Throughout the entire running time, it felt like I was watching something very abridged, like a 22 episode television series being cut down into a 90 minute motion picture. The end result you might imagine is a film that is messy and choppy with an artificial narrative and baffling character motivations.I do like the look of the film as I find the color tones and overall visual and feel of the picture to be dark and cold in a positive way, with flashes of color to balance things out. As for the performances, Nat Wolff's Light was annoying and whiny, but Lakeith Stanfield's L was interesting and enigmatic. It was more due to the film's horrid writing that stopped this version's L from becoming a great character. Willem Dafoe is the voice of the death god, Ryuk, and as with his other works, he was very good. I was never bored while watching the film, because the movie was just so visually stimulating, even if it is only on a superficial level. I would be remiss if I do not at least mention the controversial whitewash casting of the film. The original characters were Japanese, and they are white and African Americans here. I understand the producers want to make an American reworking, but likened to my feeling for other stateside manga adaptations, was an Asian American cast not an option? Will Ludi Lin or Edward Zo really perform worse than Nat Wolff? Granted even if Asian leads were cast but everything remained the same, the movie's quality probably will not improve leaps and bounds. The issue is about job opportunity for a minority group, which is its own discussion for another time.Overall Death Note is a not good movie, but it is not the train wreck others make it out to be either. It is visually interesting with some really nice gory deaths for the gore hounds, but the plot is chaos and the motivations of the characters are poorly defined. If you are a fan of the source material, I can tell you right now this is a butchered version and you will hate it. But you still might find some entertainment if you settle to see it as just a cheap Final Destination knockoff, and not the cerebral chess game of the original."
gacc-23586,Death Nope,02/10,25-Aug-17,"The main characters' personalities are completely changed. Compared to the originals they're acting like mice on cocaine; they're very impulsive and not so bright, the opposite of the characters in the source material. Only Ryuk is close but with as much screen time as he got it would've been hard to mess him up.Storywise there's no suspense, no thrill, no cold calculations, no nothing you'd expect from a Death Note adaptation. You don't get to see anything that made Death Note so appealing and great, and the story is compressed to the extent where very good parts are missing or remade in a way that makes very little or no sense. Also key details about the Death Note, its ownership and the shinigami are never even mentioned.They were so focused on whitewashing and turning it into an action movie instead of a thriller that they'd forgotten that even such works are supposed to stand on their own. And with that they have a movie that will most likely upset Death Note fans and will probably make no sense to people who have never watched the anime or read the manga.Only at the very end do we get a tiny glimpse of some proper ""death noting"" but the context ruins the moment.I only give it 2 out of 10 because the visuals are not bad."
gio_vvanni,"A new meaning to ""garbage time""",01/10,20-May-18,"I absolutely love the anime, one of the most perfect story ever told, with drama, thrill and very much else.
I watched this movie expeting very few: I knew it'd be pretty much a bad adaptation, it's very difficult an anime turned into a movie it result to be a good movie.
But however I watched it, without any expetation, just to be as less disappointed as possible.
And I was disappointed as I never was or never I'll be in my all life. First, obviously, it's an all different story and I can't even start explaining what's different because it's pretty much everything. Another user asked himself ""why they even bothered to keep the same name?"" and I couldn't agree more because the only common point are the title and the book.
And I could stand a different story, even just because there are only a couple of hours of movie, but I can not (and I hope I never will) stand a BAD story. It's pretty stereotyped in many situation and in many characters. I think of Ryuk, really an amazing character in the anime, who become basically a Joker (the Ledger's Joker).
I was also disappointed because this movie is also badly acted and badly directed and so much on. It's basically a B movie."
Hopstimop,Don't believe the Anime snobs!,09/10,29-Aug-17,"This movie is amazing!The negative reviews of all the anime kids are crap! Don't believe a word and don't believe the rating!I am somebody who hates anime and even all those who watch them.I watched this movie because of the story and because of the negative reviews of those little elitist snobs.The movie reminds me much of Donnie Darko. It has twists, suspension and a cool story. I never thought, you could get so much out of the simple story of ""guy can people by writing their names down"".If you like intense, suspense stories and well made movies and the supernatural, you have to watch it!"
felixmartinsson,A perfect Friday flick,08/10,25-Aug-17,"I'm gonna start by saying this film is not for everyone, and I can see how this could be easily misunderstood. I myself loved it. I'm not the biggest fan of manga, and even though the film gave that feeling/vibe this was an enough dose. We are introduced to Light a male teenager, with a sort of dark and gloomy but at the same time light and funny sort of vibe. He dresses in black and dark colors. There are occasions when you laugh at his reactions because they're sometimes cartoonish, but not in a bad, they're so naked and real. Nat Wolff is perfect for the role. Light finds a black notebook by accident, with the text ""Death Note"" on the cover. When he gets detention for an incident he shouldn't have been getting detention for, he opens the book and find it full of rules and instructions in handwritten black ink. It invites him to write a name of the person he wants to kill and how the person should die. Then the room gets dark and Light is introduced to a dark mysterious character named Ryuk, who is the God of death with other word his mission is to kill. At first Light think of everything as a dream, but when he Ryuk asks him to write his first victims name and try it, he writes the name of the bully who is bullying the girl he likes out on the street, and he dies. He's in shock, and doesn't know what to do with this power, until he remembers the person who killed his mother, and he finds out his name and writes it in the book and he is killed. Now after these two names he figures out this power needs to be used in the best way. His targets our now renowned criminals. He decides to let Margret (the girl he likes) in on the secret, and instantly falls for the power. They start working together ""fighting crimes"", and is now blinded by the power. They come up with a name for the keeper of the book which serves as a vigilante, his name is Kira. The name Kira grows bigger and bigger and soon everyone is talking about him and as with everything there forms different sides, the one against him and the one fighting for him. The police, FBI and the military is a little in between, but wants to find Kira no matter what. That's when the special investigator comes in. A very special one, the type you would need more background on to understand. It all ends with Margret and Light turning on each other, putting each others names in the book. That's what makes you see the ugly truth of power and what can happen once you have it. They both loved each other but even so wrote down the others name. The film is, thrilling, dark, original and leaves you wanting more. The question of ""what gives him the right to choose who lives and dies?"" was in the back of my head from time to time, even though most of the victims deserved it. And you can easily draw a parallel to the people sitting on a great power in our society today. Instead of a book and the God of death, the rulers uses technology and weapons to fight for what they believe is justice. I'm torn in-between weather I think killing is the best way to take care of problems, and I'm more on the side where ""you don't solve problems by fighting, killing"", but I can also see why it's an easier way to eliminate the problem than to lock it up, but I'm still not sure I agree."
Ben-Hibburd,Death Note Review.,06/10,25-Aug-17,"Death Note isn't a disaster, but it's an Incredibly frustrating viewing experience. I went into this film with apprehensive expectations, as a fan of both the manga and anime, but also as a big fan of Adam Wingards previous films especially 'The Guest'. There are a-lot of good things going for this film, firstly it goes without saying, that being an Adam Wingard film it has a killer synth-pop soundtrack. This might also be one of his best films visually. The film has a stylish moody tone that is interjected with splashes of vibrant neon scenes that illuminate the city of Seattle.One of the biggest issues about this film is that it tries to adapt the first 25 episodes of the anime. This makes the film feel incredibly rushed, with lot's of the manga's mythos being skipped over or relegated to the sideline. This is especially the case with Ryuk, a shingami(death god) that deliberately allows the Death Note to fall to Earth, but unlike the anime, it makes no sense as to why he's allowed it to happen in the first place(in the manga he accidentally loses the book, but here it seems like he's doing it to just kill as many people as possible.). Despite the weak characterisation of Ryuk he's played with fervour by Willem Dafoe, in a role he was born to play.This also leads me to my biggest complaint with the film, the writing, and the characterisations of the two lead characters. Nat Wolff does a fairly decent job as Light, even as the writers severely dumb down his intellect. Don't go into this film expecting a mental sparring match with L. The one aspect i did like after he received the Death Note, was that they gave him much better motivation as to why he would initially use the Death Note, and his rationale behind that decision.That said, the weakest aspect of this film is the characterisation of L, they simply messed up writing his character. None of his brilliant deductive abilities are shown, or expanded on in this film, they also make him reckless and implosive which goes against everything he stands for. I also thought Lakeith Stanfield's performance was incredibly dull, he displayed zero charisma or likability, and every-time he tried to exhibit any of L's quirks it felt forced and silly.One of the films biggest positives is Margaret Qualley she gives the best performance in the film, she's fantastic as Mia, and is an improvement on her anime counterpart. She's more involved in the plot, and does well holding her own next to Light and L.Over-all Death Note is a mixed bag, whilst i'm glad they tried to go in a couple of different directions with certain characters it felt too forceful and undid what made the characters interesting in the first place. The script tries too juggle way too many plot lines, and unfortunately drops most of them. Death Note Is an enjoyable film, but it's not without a couple of major flaws. The film could of been easily improved if the writers put better care into the script, and what made the characters great in the first place. This film had a-lot of potential, but it really should of been a 10 episode mini-series that would of allowed the writers time to fully flesh out the story."
crazybilby,They Tried. They Could've Tried Harder.,04/10,30-Aug-17,"Look, when you're condensing a 37 episode anime (or 12 volume manga) into an hour 40ish movie things will get lost. That's OK. But ultimately there are ways to effectively summarise concepts or ideas in short periods of time that they've just failed to do. We're introduced to the basic idea of the Death Note we're all familiar with just sped up for time. Then about mid-way the plot starts trying to be its own thing. I commend it for that. I wouldn't want to watch a boring condensed retelling of something that relied so well on pacing and cliffhanger moments in the original. There are points this actually starts to look interesting and there are some nice moments as the tension starts to climb. The third act falls apart though. There are some strange directorial choices where the emotions don't hit right for the tone. When Ryuk is first encountered he's meant to be this terrifying unknown dark force coming from nowhere. Light's reaction is just... bad. There's also some really obnoxious and on the nose music choices during key moments that really ruin the moment. It brings you out of it and you go ""OK, I get it. I know you're INSTRUCTING me to feel a certain way but that's not how emotions work.""A big reason why this adaptation fails is its poor handling (or outright butchering) of the characters. For example: L and Light are both originally geniuses in their own right. Driven, determined, masterminds, whose unending quest to get what they want causes them to have a high stakes battle of wit, quick thinking, and clever gambles. In this movie the two aren't very bright. Light isn't a genius. He's an edgelord loner teen with an inexplicable crush on the ~edgy goth-lite~ girl. Admittedly he does have some brilliant moments but he's still a pale comparison. L shows one moment of deductive brilliance and then is reduced to an emotionally ineffective antagonist. Mia's character lacks motivation. Mia in the original was a terrible character and drastically changing her could have been a great improvement from the original's sexist handling of women as pawns and side pieces for the men to use as servants to their bidding (seriously, the women in the original are SO STUPID it's painful). But at least Mia's motivations made sense. In this movie she has no backstory, all we know is that she's EDGY (and smoked a cigarette that one time in a montage and then never again but YOU KNOW SHE DOES IT), and she ultimately serves as this bizarre 2D mirror to Light. Light admittedly has more of a conflicted moral compass in this film compared to the original single-minded arrogance which is perhaps the only good thing about him.So yeah. Depth. The characters are different and that'd be forgivable if they had more depth to them.In short: a few good moments but in the end hits below average overall."
rachelflowers-03467,Wow!! Too awesome!!,10/10,13-Apr-20,"I really thought this movie was going to be just another cheaply thrown together and suck but it really surprised me. This was a great movie with plenty of twists and turns. I saw some other reviews of this and learned it came from animae which i can't stand but this movie was well played with some instances that you wouldn't expect. Definitely a movie i recommend!!

andreccharles,Worst live action adaptation ever.,01/10,27-Aug-17,"This is an insult to the original anime series and the other live action movies. Its only saving grace was Keith Stanfield, he captured L perfectly... everything else is pure garbage. 10 minutes into it and i was bored and uninterested. Netflix needs to delete this from their library and try again. Or not... just leave live action remakes alone.

zacharyjhadd,Death Note by name only,01/10,13-Nov-21,"If you are hoping to see something like the Manga or Anime, with clever trickery, suspenseful moments, investigation, and all around well thought out plot and story line... you will be very disappointed.All the rules of the death note are either slightly wrong or completely changed.All the characters are Americanized... which isn't horrible if you are trying to do a completely different story with different plot and characters. However, that is not what this is. Light Yagami is Light Turner, Misa is changed to Mia but Kira stays Kira with some cover up to justify it? Come on...Ryuk is probably the best part and most true character with the exception that he influences things more than the Manga version would have. Willem Dafoe does an amazing job with him. But tragically Ryuk has VERY little screen time.L is done very well from an acting stand point. He is very well done by LaKeith Standfield. You can tell he had done his homework and captures L well. Unfortunately again, the script doesn't allow him to really show it off that much.Overall, I believe the director and the rest of the writing crew did not understand death note. Either that, or they had a very different focus for their version of it. It felt like they tried to turn it into another teen movie, making decisions based on gaining viewers rather than trying to represent the great original material they had to work with."
jaidanh,Far from rewatchable,01/10,02-Mar-21,"I saw the original Death Note anime before I watched this film, and I consider it to be the best anime ever. This live-action film however is an absolute dumpster fire. Now usually a movie adaptation of a Japanese anime doesn't work when the characters are whitewashed. However, since Death Note is set in the real world, I don't mind giving it an American adaptation. But they could've done so much better. This film barely uses any of its original source material. The people that made this film obviously haven't seen the original anime. It looks like they just read a summary of it and just went from there.In the original Death Note, Light was a genius who commits reasonable murders. In this film, he's the complete opposite. He's an actual dumbass, very unlikable, and has no clear motive behind the murders he commits. Mia is also unlikeable in this film. She and Light have absolutely no chemistry at all unlike Misa and Light in the original anime. Also, can we talk about the rule changes? There are several changes but I'll give you one. In the original Death Note, if you touch the book, you can see the Shinigami. In this film, only Light can see Ryuk and no one else can, even when Mia touches it.The overall script is plain terrible. The soundtrack doesn't fit with the tone. There is no character development and every character is just one-dimensional. Most of the acting is bad, particularly from Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley. The only good thing about this film was Willem Dafoe's performance as Ryuk. Aside from that, there's nothing good about this film, and I will never watch it again. If you're new to the Death Note franchise and want to get into it, stay away from this film."
Zeesh_Q,Great Anime turned to farce movie,01/10,27-Aug-17,"American directors/writers/producers should never be given rights to Japanese material. They should learn to see from Japanese cinematic what makes a great storytelling. Don't watch this if you have seen the Japanese anime. This will ruin your good memories.Its just the same as Ghost in the Shell adaptation.Disappointed in Netflix too.

nugchampa,How could a director who read and seen the Anime get this so WRONG!!!,01/10,27-Aug-17,"Pros: 1. The production quality was OK.2. William Dafoe does a great job playing Ryuk 3. L & Watari's relationship was portrayed fairly well.Cons:1. This movie Felt insanely rushed 2. It is completely different from the Anime/Manga,so if your a die hard fan this will most Definitely get you mad.3. Because Mia is not given a Deathnote we not only loss Rem, but there are now new rules in the Deathnote in order to prevent her from taking it from Light(for example only the 1st person who touches the Deathnote can see and talk to Ryuk). 4. No Shinigami Eyes 5. Instead of giving us a Joker & Harley relationship with Light and Mia, we got a jealous high school couple story. In the anime Light was a slick womanizer, but in this movie he tries really hard to impress 1 average girl....6. Light comes up with the idea of calling himself Kira. 7. Lots of cliché parts in this film like an unnecessary chase scene,and the famous holding on to someone with one hand to prevent them from falling to their death. 8. Ending is terrible because its a cliffhanger. With so many changes to the anime story line the movie and the audience deserve closure. 9. L was good in the first half, but he becomes a pointless charter in the second half.... which is hard to watch if your a Deathnote fan. 10. The director claimed to have loved the Deathnote anime and would do it justice....Obviously he has no idea was justice is.... because HOW IS THERE NO POTATO CHIP SCENE!!!!!11. Mia was written to be a hated charter in this movie, where in the anime she was a beloved charter that the audience sympathized with."
hazeem-ul-hussain,Awesome movie if you haven't watched the anime...,08/10,29-Sep-21,"It was really good as a movie, I watched the movie and when I did I hadn't watched the anime. It was really good for me because I wasn't comparing the original source material to the live action. The issue is that most people want it to be exactly like the anime, the director was trying to make his own version of it based on the anime not exact Xerox copy of the anime, if that wasn't his intention he would have simply made it happen in Japan, with a Japanese cast etc. I know the anime is really good because I'm currently watching it, I'm loving it and can't seem to stop watching it. Have a open mind, think of it as a what if episode from marvel.I loved the movie, I truly enjoyed I and I love the anime as well since I'm watching it now.

hollykleszczewski,Fine in the bad way,05/10,29-Apr-23,"I went into it knowing the hate around the movie and expected it but what I didn't expect was that as a standalone movie completely detached from the anime or Manga,
it's fine like a pretty fine horror movie that you can put on in October but if you do take it as like a connection of the anime or Manga it's absolute trash
Ryuk: one of my favorite characters in the anime second to Mikasa (I'll get to her soon) looks very very cool other than that his personality didn't really feel like himself well the original ryuk was never a good guy per se he never felt evil more like just a neutral Force well here he feels like a devil temptation kind of way and just quote some of the lines from the anime and that's just a major disappointment because he looks really really cool
Mia?: Brunette Mikasa ripoff I really hated her
L: his introduction was a little weak to be honest but I'm really mad that they didn't give him those dark spots under his eyes like they do in the anime
Light: totally different from a clever and cunning high school boy to a snot-nosed a little cry baby in the anime when he first gets the death note he tests it out and learns it's real and through trial and error he discovers what he can do but in the movie light is just told all the rules front and center without having to figure them out on his own.The Note: there were originally only three ish rules it's been a while since I've seen the anime but from what I remember you have to write the person's full name while thinking about their face in order for them to die. Death must be specified within 6 minutes. And I forgot the last one but in the movie while light is reading a few allowed I'm like oh so they added a few that's fine I guess it's a movie but randomly he says ""rule 93"" 93!!!!?? That's really really insane and just tells light what he can and can't do without having him figure it out on his own also they removed the most fun rules that if you touch the death note you can see the shinigami but no only the owner can see it... Lame
If you want to put on a horror movie during Halloween and none of your friends have watched the anime I would show them the movie because on its own it's pretty fine but if you are actually watching it as a fan of the anime/manga you will get mad at some points. One thing I want to finally mention is that they actually ramp up the gore and I actually kind of like that but yeah this movie's just. Fine."
Brevin_Campbell,Death Note is a rushed mixed bag,05/10,26-Aug-17,"So I was relatively looking forward to Netflix's Death Note adaptation because of director Adam Wingard. This is a director who I felt would be a good choice to work on the iconic Death Note live action movie. He seemed like a decent choice who would take the source material and go a different way with it. Sadly he really doesn't and instead tries to merge his own creativity with the the ideas of the Death Note and the stuff the series had in it. Which was a very bad decision. This film actually is making me rethink my stance on Ghost in the Shell. For all of that movies issues it was still very true to the source material and did take the time to develop the characters. The movie creates this meaningless relationship between Light and Mia that when you watch it you find it to be quite a weak relationship that doesn't seem to be rooted in much at all. In fact throughout the movie you feel like that there is no way these two are really in love, but that what kinda makes the ending so brilliant. Yup honestly if it wasn't for the way the film ended I probably would feel like the movie was eh..OK at best. I think I probably had the most issue with the character of Light Turner. He defiantly wasn't the smart kid I thought he would be from the anime and instead seemed like a emo and depressed kid with a weird superiority complex. That being said I thought Nat Wolfe's performance did a decent job pulling if off. Actually all the acting in the film I found to be pretty decent IMO. I also thought the characterization of L was also pretty great and pretty interesting too. It was very different from the source material, but I liked it. Also I looooovveed Ryuk. OMG was Ryuk. I could just gush over those parts all days. They made me squee.However I found that one legitimate problem that the film has is pacing. The movie just moves waayy to fast. It doesn't ever even once try to focus on a moment of character to get us really attached to one. To the point I thought if Light and Mia died I probably wouldn't care that much cause I feel like I didn't know them well enough. Also the song choices were terrible. I mean god awful.The entire first half is also all over the place. It was a real mess of a first act and made it hard to get through. Overall this movie is a mixed bag of good and bad. I am still glad I watched it though. Id probably be more upset at the film if I didn't already have the amazing Japanese trilogy of films which I still can watch. If your one of the few people who still hasn't watched it I'd say give it a try. After all it only on Netflix."
emounicorn-96979,MY OPTION,01/10,08-Apr-22,"I only give this 1 star because the Shinugami was actually really good looking, but the fact the makers of this movie couldn't even get the character 'L' the right way was the biggest turn off for this movie.

tastingthestars,Terrible,01/10,25-Aug-17,"Terrible acting. Completely whitewashed other than the fact that L is black. Pure Hollywood trash. Completely shits on the original. The anime and original Japanese movie are far, far better. I expected nothing and I'm still let down by this trash. Save yourself, my friends.

muraliresponsible,If Netflix is listening: 'Please don't make a sequel!',01/10,27-Aug-17,"Now I do not have a problem with changing the setting to America and using American actors. I especially do not mind people saying 'Hey why can this not be its own thing...why do you have to remain faithful to the original yada yada..'. I have seen Death Note. I have read all the alternate endings out there(including the Japanese live action movie). I got enough of the Japanese angle on the material that I did not watch the Japanese series that came out lately. So I guess I am qualified to say I know the premise a little.So let's look at the movie as its own thing. Choppy, rushed and severely under-cooked in terms of character motivations. Light is a high schooler who basically goes on a murdering rampage to impress a girl. Period. Ryuk has well no motivation until he spouts 'Humans are interesting' at the very end. Mia is well...she is a cheerleader...Nothing she does ever means anything. I am just quoting her. Interesting take on L, but half cooked nonetheless. He is practically a crybaby and maybe you could justify it somewhat....er no you can't..Sorry big L fan. At least Mia/Misa is not bright and annoying, although in a very different sense. And yeah there are other people doing nothing as well.Nat Wolff is surprisingly bad. Would have loved Willem Dafoe if he was given better lines. Stanfield does his best to make L interesting. I acknowledge he is quite talented. But I cannot keep the bias out...L is one of my all time favorite anime characters. And yeah there are other people doing nothing.Now off to mild SPOILERS! There's a teenager who is supposedly very bright and finds a death note and chooses to read it on the stands of his high school basketball court with cheerleaders working out. Wait...Light would never do that...he would go through devising a devilish contraption so that no one would ever lay their hands on it...whoops! this is its own thing. But they did imply 'this' Light was smart. Wait so L is a genius and he knows that Light needs a name and a face to kill and is sure that Light is Kira like not 5% sure...absolutely sure...and still decides to show his face...darn it...I digress to the original again. Why would you keep the character names the same, the essential premise the same and still expect people to not draw comparisons.As its own thing, the film is a proper mess. The only silver lining is that it does not feel under-cooked to people who already know the premise well are familiar with the character traits and motivations, feel empathetic to whichever side takes their fancy( did I say I am an L fan already), in other word(s), fans. Well fans would not like it would they, because if this stops being its own thing and is actually an adaptation, it is a pretty poor one. So I suppose it is a 0/10 either way.Wait wtf happened to the potato chips? -10/10"
sonnygoten,They dumbed down the plot and characters.,03/10,29-Aug-17,"The anime, while not perfect, was a highly memorable and enjoyable cat-and- mouse game with some quirky standout moments. Compared to this drag of a movie, with no interesting cat-and-mouse game to speak of and a romance tumor that takes up half the plot, it's downright a masterpiece.Light Yagami, paranoid genius sociopath in the anime, becomes Light Turner, an overly emotional but only moderately intelligent teen, who reveals his murder weapon to his girlfriend in the first few minutes. L Lawliet, in the anime a genius detective with weird quirky habits (a tribute to Sherlock Holmes), turns into a hot-headed gun-toting testosterone fueled Neanderthal called simply L, who's outsmarted by an averagely intelligent teen.Misa is the only improvement from the anime. From obsessive love interest with virtually no will of her own, she turns into Mia in the movie, a moderately intelligent teen girl with her own ideas and agenda. Her level of agency soars up, but Mia is still outwitted by Light in the end. Unfortunately, this isn't very spectacular, because they're both not geniuses.The themes of the story are also heavily changed. The anime's theme was 'power corrupts'. The movie's theme is that 'killing your bully is alright, and working outside the law is justified when you're killing (ex-)criminals'. The theme of the movie runs pretty much opposite that of the anime.All the whitewashing accusations aside (and there are many), the movie is basically a dumbed down version of the anime. Production values are also not that great and musical score doesn't fit at all. Not a good movie."
uludag,"This is not a death note, this is degeneration note",01/10,27-Aug-17,"well, i lost some precious time of my life trying to watch and endure this film, and i failed. Here i am to warn the other anime lovers writing this note.Stay away this film! Unlike the complex deep storytelling anime approach, this film is shallow, popcorn youth horror movie includes CGI effects, legs and nothing elseI don't know the aim of producers here, but i will not be surprised if this movie would be a blow to anime genre, since some who didn't watch the anime first would think or say ""What is special about anime thing anyway? I saw that death note who adapted from anime and it was stupid!""I would respect more, if they changed the name of title and name of characters. I would say ""Hey this is a shallow copy of death note"" and would add ""watch the original"" and i guess then i would give 2 stars."
ozwalrh,"The film changes many aspects of the anime, but that does not make it total garbage as others would suggest",08/10,26-Aug-17,"I consider that the fan rage over this one is way too out of proportion. This film does change many aspects of the original work, but that doesn't make it an awful movie, the way to enjoy this picture is to consider it as an alternate take of what would've happened if the book was dropped in the US instead of Japan, thus being a completely different take on the same core concept. Perhaps the greatest mistake of this production was not differentiating the main characters even more from the source material, if the characters were given completely new identities that didn't resemble their Japanese counterparts as much, this film would have been received much more favorably than it has thus far.

jan-hranac,Americans shouldn't make remakes of other people's films,01/10,12-Dec-21,"...aka Dumb Chases Dumber.When I was a kid, I saw a western remake of Seven Samurai. The western version wasn't as good as the original, of course, but it was an enjoyable lighthearted entertainment and far more easily digestible than the Japanese one. I can't think of any other remake which wasn't either ""just"" bad or downright a travesty. Netflix's Death Note is a travesty.For one, I don't think the concept really works outside of Japanese environment. American's simply have a different mindset and characters like Kira and L simply don't exist in their society.And that brings us to the greatest problem of this flick: the so called ""L"" and ""Kira"" can't be L and Kira. Those two guys are supposed to be larger than life geniuses, the very best of the best in their respective fields. Kira is supposed to be a legal prodigy and a future master prosecutor who, at the beginning of the story, possesses quite decent morals and a great sense of duty. L is supposed to be an unrealistically smart investigator, something like Holmes and Poirot combined. Instead, L is an immature, troubled, retarded, and unstable child who would never get to work with law enforcement in the real world. And Kira... well he's just an ordinary guy and kind of an underdog. Most certainly not someone who could be considered as smart as Kira. The trouble is, unlike in the original, he was chosen to receive the book, it wasn't an accident. And there's no way someone that ordinary would get chosen by a god of death."
joiningjt,"Excellent movie, great concept, ignore the morons!!!",10/10,26-Sep-20,"When are people going to wake the bleep up and realize a movie will never be as good as the book, anime, manga, original, so either do 1 of 2 things, don't watch, watch without a preconceived idea of what its supposed to be!!! If you watch it just base it on it's own merits. Not what you the loser who didn't do anything but judge something you cannot and never will do thinks of it!! Sick of book comparisons and anime/manga comparisons!! Get a life people!!!!

marc5477,Not good as a standalone. Atrocious as an adaptation.,02/10,31-Aug-17,"There are two types of reviews. One is the type that compares the movie to the original story in which case, this was very bad. The characters have no relation to the originals. This is more of a high school drama than a well thought out thriller. Light is basically a love stricken teen with barely average intelligence, who allows a girl he barely knows, to join in his death note activities. She, like him, isn't very bright and ends up being his undoing. L is equally unrecognizable. He is an emotional mess and fails to recognize several obvious points. For instance, he puts himself in danger assuming Kira will try to kill him but he knew that Kira was killing criminals so how exactly would that make sense or prove anything? It wouldn't. Also when Kira pattern changed, he didn't even bother to consider that it might not have been Kira. L was a dolt.The other type of review attempts to review the movie on its own merit. It is clearly trying to be a thriller but for the reasons stated above, it came off as a teenage love interest drama like Vampire Diaries or Teen Wolf (tv series). The plot simply failed the intelligence test required for a thriller. The acting was good in some places and terrible in other (the scene where Light was scared of Ryuk was hilariously awful). There was little character development in Mia, Ryuk, or L so they came off as either empty or idiotic. No matter how you slice it, this movie is not good."
jackygomes,A psychological thriller turned into a teen drama,01/10,26-Aug-17,"I'm a huge fan of the anime but I tried to watch this movie with an open mind. And I've failed. I'm trying to decide what was the worst part. The fact that a psychological thriller was turned into a teen drama about the cliché boy that thinks with his dick or that they turned one of the best sociopath villains ever made into a coward teenager. Light was supposed to be a manipulative guy and a sociopath. The character don't care about anyone around him not even his family. He makes everyone fear him with just a pen and a notebook. That's brilliant! Is this version he screams, tells awful jokes and tries to nail Mia (Misa) all the time. WTF? This was Nat Wolff's worst performance. The script and direction are simply horrible. They had the perfect story and tried to make a ""Final Destination 7"" out of it. It was lame and a shame to see this happen to such an amazing story."
Tysl332,Pure Comedy!,01/10,26-Aug-17,"This adoption was completely laughable! I am a fan of the Anime/Manga so I've tried really I tried seeing this from both point of views and no matter what it was like watching a bad soap opera trying to become a comedy. But honestly, this was mediocre at its best and at the way it ended you can clearly tell he intended it to be open for another comedy routine. Just about the only good thing from this movie was Ryuk that's it William Dafoe was a good choice but his character was rewritten very poorly ...

nahumthebest,"This is NOT a replica of the anime; I had very LOW expectations, but the film managed to keep me entertained and interested. I thought it was fine.",08/10,27-Aug-17,"I give this movie a B- or 8.0/10.0I've watched Death Note (anime), which is the original source material, at least five times, from start to finish. I mean, it is only 20min x 37eps = 12.33hrs anyway. I've watched the whole thing in a Saturday and a weekend. You only discover small flaws in the anime after you're watching it the 4th time onward. But it's still one of the best anime I've ever watched and I think I'll go watch it again from start to finish after writing this review.I expected this NETFLIX Death Note movie to be absolutely terrible. I just finished watching the movie and I'm writing my review immediately afterwards.Here's what they did: they took the concept of Death Note, they took a few events and ideas that did happen in the original source material, e.g. watching the news to get the names of criminals, FBI tails, surveillance cameras at home, the red apples, Ryuk's mysterious ominous laughs, etc., you get the point.However, the screenwriters Charles Parlapanides, Vlas Parlapanides, and Jeremy Slater and director Adam Wingard came up with their own 91-minute version of Death Note. They made the movie truly their own. Their intention was clearly not at all to merely replicate the original source material, but to take the concepts of Death Note and come up with a movie of their own and that's what they did.Initially I was immediately critical of the casting, I mean, those people look absolutely nothing like the original characters. But once I started watching the movie I started to appreciate the approach the screenwriters and director took. After watching the film I felt that it was fine. I was not bored, it kept me entertained, the plot was sufficiently new to keep me on my toes since I wanted to know what would happen.Overall, the movie was produced just fine. It was an entertaining different approach to Death Note.I know everyone wanted to see a movie that was 100% loyal to the original source material, but the people that made the movie didn't feel like going in that direction, and there's nothing we can do about that. It cost millions to make the film and I got to watch it for FREE - who am I to complaint at all? I think L's acting was great, and way better than Light. L was my favorite character in this movie.I wish the ending had been more definitive. I mean, we all know ""what L would do"", but I just wished we had seen what he did, just like we definitely saw ""it"" in the anime. You won't know what I'm talking about until you get to the end of the movie. Actually, I think it was a very clever ending and I liked it a lot, but I just wished it had been definitive and right in your face so that I can move on with my life knowing what happened.CONCLUSION: this movie is not at all a replica of the anime, so you need to accept that. The screenwriters took a lot of creative liberties with the plot. A few things from the anime are in the film. Overall, it was an entertaining movie since the plot was mostly new. I'd recommend it. I'm thankful I got to watch the movie."
chromebooknickk,Wow,01/10,27-Aug-17,"This was actually offensively bad. They completely bastardized the source material, stripping anything of actual substance and filling it with clichéd cookie-cutter scenes and terrible acting.I guess they spent all their budget on Willem Dafoe and CGI and couldn't hire any other decent actors or film a real story? Either that or they were just trying to make a quick buck capitalizing on the name.Original Series was great, Japanese live actions were okay, and this is just...

helgavandijk,A disgrace to the anime/manga,01/10,27-Aug-17,"A disgrace to the anime/manga. Nothing more to be said. It's awful. Maybe it's decent for those who haven't seen the anime or read the manga. But for the DN fans; You better skip this. Especially L was represented horribly. L is supposed to be smart and calm while the L in this movie is emotional and made me facepalm (especially in the alley scene) completely out of character.

joshacdc,Movie vs show,04/10,17-Jun-23,"If you are watching this movie just as is with no prior knowledge then it's a B rated movie. Nothing great but also not that bad. But if you have seen the show you will see they are 90% different. The show is S tear show, going from something amazing to something that's just bland and missing a good chunk of detail makes it look like a really bad movie. I wish the movie was more based off the show but I also can't logically see how they would put all of that in under 2 hours. If you have never seen the show go watch that right now. If you have seen the show and want to watch an okayish film then this is for you.

kinnisha_andrew,Why would they do this.,01/10,26-Aug-17,"This is a godawful adaptation of an amazing manga and anime. Americans need to leave Japanese content alone, come up with their own ideas and maybe stop remaking stuff for the thousandth time? I can't believe Netflix green-lights nonsense like this and Hemlock Grove but cancels amazing shows like Sense8 and The Get Down. Clearly they know what their viewers want.

DrknssFlame,"IMO, a well thought out American version of a Japanese anime classic",08/10,09-Sep-17,"Many people are slamming this title due to it being different from the original content. I have to say that I appreciated the change. Don't get me wrong, I love the anime and will always be a fan. But, having watched and finished it, I'm happy with a movie version that isn't just a rehash of the same thing I just watched; otherwise, I'd just watch the anime again. I loved that this movie took a popular Japanese show, rooted VERY deeply in Japanese culture, and showed how Americans would handle any of these given situations. It, to me, was very relatable, and it shows a deeper side of human thinking that most people won't delve into due to ethics/morality.The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen on screen, I can admit. But what the acting from the individuals lacked, I felt they made up with their chemistry. You could tell that they enjoyed/had fun working on this project; such as when Light and L first met in person, just like in the anime, I was excited and waiting to see how it would turn out. I can say that in neither was I disappointed. The dialogue was witty, gave me some chuckles, and showed the intellect of the 2 main characters.I hope that people can give this a chance before just writing it off and saying that they don't want to see their favorite anime destroyed. Even if you don't like the movie, just rewatch the anime and let it rejuvinate your spirit."
rahskir,Not as bad as the user reviews,06/10,28-Aug-17,"I tend to not watch anything that gets below a 5 on IMDb, so I almost didn't see this. It was a little corny at times, but definitely was a solid IMDb 6. I think that if you are a big anime fan then you will hate it, but for someone like me it had a lot to offer. I went to high school in the early 2000s and it is a clear throwback to that time. I only ever watched anime back then so I wasn't super critical about how it didn't follow the same plot. I thought that giving it a high school theme kind of gave it the complete throwback feel that was too nostalgic for me to hate. The actors made an effort to move like anime characters and I think that what got lost in translation was the fact that the movie was fun entertainment and a bit of a parody on over serious anime. I was entertained. spoilers below.The ending of the movie was honestly better story telling than the original because they kept the two rivaling characters until the end. It would have been fun to see another death note and see make up for another death god, but I knew that wouldn't happen because a two hour format wouldn't allow for it. Anime fans are intense and I understand the emotion behind their reviews but these users are being way too harsh. That said if you are big into anime, maybe you should skip it. If you just listened to too much nin in high school and miss a good teen angst movie, then grab the popcorn!"
roelsemail,Good watch,07/10,18-Feb-18,"I haven't watched ""Desu Noto"".. or whatever the nerds call the ""original"" movie. But whatever they say: this is is a good watch.I watch a lot of movies, but those guys that have seen the foreign version always like to pretend that it's better or that it's of higher arstical value... bullsh*t. I'm writing this is review, just to give a counter voice to those Asian-o-philes, you know the types, But this movie is a solid 7.And a solid 7, is worth your time. I'm not going to tell you that the foreing version is better.... and i'm not going to tell you that you will like this movie more than anything.All I am saying is that this movie is well worth your 80 minutes. I think you will like it and I think you will have a good evening watching this movie.
And that's the end of this review.Let's not f*""ck about with this ""the Asian version is better"" Good movie, worth your time."
justind-5,"F*&% the haters, it was a good movie!",09/10,28-Sep-17,"So sick of all these people, oh it was an injustice to the original, oh what a shame, blah blah blah! So what it's not as good as the original anime, what does it have to be compared to the anime version???? Watch it on it's own merits.Not everyone has seen the Anime series, not everyone wants or likes to watch anime. The movie is great on its own merits, sure there are some shortcomings, but overall, it was a really entertaining, interesting movie. Willem Dafoe steals the show as the demon, and the main actor was really interesting and well cast, as was the father. The girlfriend could have acted a little better.Seriously, this movie deserves way more then a 4.5 out of 10, most of these votes came after watching pewdie pies review most likely.Go watch it yourself, maybe if you've seen the original skip it, but if you are new to deathnote, check it out, I really enjoyed it, and looking forward to the sequel."
mikewestcoast,I really liked this Netflix movie.,10/10,28-Aug-17,"I recommend that you watch this movie before reading any reviews. Simply make up your own mind about this movie as to whether you like it or not. I just watched Death Note tonight on Netflix. Just before I wrote this review, I read a few bad reviews on IMDb about this movie. Then I immediately stopped reading these bad reviews. I've never heard of Death Note before, so I was hoping to see a unique movie on Netflix since there seems to be too many movies on Netflix that I'm not interested in. I thought the acting was good and I liked to the story. It was certainly a unique story, in my book. I was glued to the TV when watching this movie. I hope they come out with a sequel or two.

For multiple reasons. 1) Made me smile, and want to go back and watch the show. 2) Acting wasn't as bad as I expected ( came in with low low low expectations) 3) Viewed this for what it was and not what it could be.

topi-nevalainen,Okay for what it is.,05/10,24-Apr-21,"I have absolutely no idea of the original Death Note manga and everything related to it, so I rate this movie as a standalone movie. It was a stupid, but an entertaining movie with really good production values. Not a 1/10 movie that so many people have rated it. Typical fanboy over reaction.

Hellmant,"Watch it on Netflix now, to guarantee a sequel happens!",09/10,30-Aug-17,"'DEATH NOTE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A horror-fantasy thriller from director Adam Wingard (who's also helmed such other indie hit thrillers as 'THE GUEST' and 'YOU'RE NEXT'). It tells the story of a high school student who fights crime by using a mysterious book he finds, called 'Death Note', which allows him to kill criminals by writing about their deaths in his book. It's based on a popular Japanese manga, of the same name, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. The film was scripted by Jeremy Slater and Charles and Vlas Parlapanides; marking a collaborating departure from Wingard's usual screenwriter partner, Simon Barrett. The movie stars Nat Wolff, Lakeith Stanfield, Margaret Qualley, Shea Whigham, Paul Nakauchi, Jason Liles and Willem Dafoe. It's gotten mixed, to negative, reviews from critics and viewers alike; with many criticizing the film's departure from the original source material, as well as whitewashing casting accusations. The manga creators (Ohba and Obata) have both highly praised the film adaptation though. It was released by Netflix, through their streaming site (which is where I saw it), and I absolutely loved it!Light Turner (Wolff) is a high school student who lives with his dad, a police officer named James Turner (Whigham), in Seattle. He and his father are still mourning the death of Light's mother, who was killed by a criminal that was never convicted of the crime. Light also spends his time helping other students cheat on their homework, and crushing on a cheerleader at school, named Mia Sutton (Qualley). One school day afternoon Light finds a strange book titled 'Death Note'. He's later greeted (in detention) by a demonic god called Ryuk (Dafoe and Liles), who explains the book's powers to him. Light first uses the 'Death Note' to avenge his mother's murder, he then continues to cause the death of others with it, but only criminals that he thinks the world would be better off without. This enormous power becomes a huge burden as well, when an FBI detective, called L (Stanfield), begins trying to stop him. I never read the manga this movie is based on, and I actually knew nothing about it prior to seeing this film, so I had no expectations for this feature adaptation, other than it's directed by Adam Wingard (who I've been a fan of for years). I went into it with low expectations, because of the negative reviews (and I totally understand the whitewashing complaint, of depriving Asian actors of roles), but other than that, the movie is fantastic. I absolutely loved it (like I already said). I have no idea how faithful it is to the source material, but as a film it's completely original, creative and highly entertaining. It totally defies the usual genre conventions, and maybe the manga does that too, but as a movie it's a really well made and effective film. It's Adam Wingard at his best (after a slight disappointment with the 'BLAIR WITCH' reboot), and the cast is all outstanding as well (especially Dafoe, as an extremely memorable villain). I highly look forward to the planned sequel. Watch the original now, on Netflix, to guarantee it happens (please)!Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/KR0HDeT91m0"
sharky_55,I don't have a pen.,04/10,26-Aug-17,"Netflix's adaptation of Death Note stinks of everything wrong with Hollywood. It begins and ends with the film's desperate attempts at every turn to apologise on behalf of its fated protagonist, to shift the blame of mass murder from his hands. What could be more Hollywood than turning this into a tale of the underdog? Even after the credits roll we're still harbouring a soft spot for poor little Light Turner, and in the climatic action sequence we're biting our fingernails and hoping this misunderstood nerd gets out of this alive and with his innocence intact. The original Japanese story, I think, was compelling in spite of the book's nature, because Light as a character wholly believed in what he was doing. He was bestowed a god-given right to cleanse the earth of evil, yet along the way failed to realise he had become what he sought to purge. The end of Wingard's version leaves us confused rather than certain of the character's obsession, as if they had felt the need to throw one more complicated spanner into the works, all while stretching the believability of the powers of a tattered calculus book. Light's back, not as the charismatic power player beyond reproach but as a moody teenager who silently broods behind his bleached-blonde fringe, eyeing pretty cheerleaders and wishing he could do his fellow underlings all a favour and kill off his bullying tormentors. It is one fated day when the death god Ryuk actually delivers him this ability that his life takes a turn for the better and the edgier; he gets his hot cheerleader girlfriend, shares with her the secret of near omnipotent killing power, and in between offing death row inmates they can barely keep their hands off each other. For those of you hoping for a bit of Heathers-esque satirical bite, you're out of luck. Although Wingard makes some brave and sometimes inspired choices concerning the mood here, pumping in soft, sultry 80s pop hits and casting his faces in neon glow, vital moments are often strained to their utmost through slow-motion. The intent is to be agonising but this mostly becomes a cause for eye- rolling. The scripts dangles (literally) the pair's lives before our eyes, but later wants to be revisionist and claim it was all a masterminded plan. Positioned away from traditional censors the Netflix platform allows movies the freedom to be as graphic as the want, but the creative license that Death Note wields only gets it into more trouble. Dialled up from the genius mind of Light, its executions are treated like comic relief, gratuitous little skits in the vein of Final Destination that will have viewers doubling over in laughter rather than grimly realising the untapped killing potential of the notebook. It's hard to take Light seriously when he sends a head flying off its neck for some light bullying, and harder still when the death is the result of a curious series of events that stumble into a tragic (and hilarious) accident. And later still, when his conscience reaches its breaking point and can't bare to murder innocents, it's a little hard not to scoff. The film fast forwards through all the intrigue of the criminal investigation and the game of cat and mouse between two geniuses at a breakneck pace, palming off the more sinister of Kira's intentions to the maniacal girlfriend instead. And it's just as well too; Light's a significantly watered down version of his manga counterpart, letting the book's mystical powers (now including complete mind control for up to two full days) do all the heavy lifting for him. When all is said and done there's barely any room left for his duel of wits with L. Lakeith Stanfield begins the film speaking Japanese but quickly switches to English, and that's about the extent of his gifts on show; most of his screen time is spent wringing his hands at the escalating chaos of the case, and in his one moment of spirited action, he's huffing and puffing through a poorly edited street chase that seems far beyond the athletic capabilities of either genius. What gives? There may be some stirrings of an intriguing dilemma presented to him at the close, now faced with the same test of morality that he once condemned Light for, but it's far too late to start that exploration, and not nearly enough to keep Ryuk interested any longer. Or the audience for that matter."
phanthinga,If there is a book that can kill whatever people you want just by writing their name on it then you should read the instructions first,07/10,01-Feb-19,"It's been such a long time since I read Death Note the manga and because I never touch the anime or the live action adaptation from Japan so I'm not the best person to judge how faithful it is to the source material but just like how I loved Ghost in the Shell (2017) for it ballsy move to create an actual background story for Major Kusanagi so I think the best for me is to expect the unexpected and you guys know what? I unironically enjoy Death Note (2017) for what it is. Sure, as far as an adaptation can go this one definitely jump the big shark when it completely rewrite the complex story and the lore of Death Note into something more suitable for the general audience like how every Americanized movie from the beginning of mankind and that not bother me one bit. The main character act like how a real life edgy teenager would act if he got the power to kill anyone with just a book even when that a slap to the face for fan of Light Yagami. For L the genius detective I don't think what race he is should be the problem because he did a good job with the role and if you actually a true fan of the manga you will know there can be multiple L. To be frank Death Note (2017) is not even the worst and the last adaptation to ever come out from the West I can tell you that"
Cliffhanger94,If you can keep an open mind you might have fun with it.,07/10,25-Aug-17,"Death Note is one of my all time favorite anime's, on top of that I personally really enjoy the live action Japanese film adaptations. So when I found out that they were making an American adaptation I got excited. Just watched it tonight and honestly I enjoyed it. It's far from perfect but that doesn't make it a bad film. One thing I will say is that if you want or are expecting a faithful adaptation of the source material you probably won't get it here, but if you can keep an open mind you should be able to find some enjoyment as well as some entertainment out of it.You can tell that the filmmakers were trying their best to pay tribute to the manga/anime while also doing something different. The actor's were also doing their best to stay somewhat true to the original characters while also doing something new and making the characters their own, to varying degrees of success. The stand outs to me being Lekeit Stanfield as L, and of course Willem Dafoe steals every scene as the voice of Ryuk.I also would like to point out the whitewashing controversy as I personally find it ridiculous, this is an American adaptation of a foreign property. It's no different from American filmmakers remaking foreign films or for filmmakers from foreign countries remaking American films. So please don't let the whitewashing/Americanization of a Japanese property turn you off from watching this.All in all I really liked this film despite its flaws. If you want something that more closely follows the source material then I recommend sticking with the anime, I'll openly admit the anime is better, as are the live action Japanese films. However its still not half bad, and definitely worth a watch."
sclafunk,No thank you.....,01/10,13-Jun-19,"Why? I don't even understand why this was made. The anime this is based on is, IMO, one of the best stories ever told by humankind in any medium. Binge that instead of this. The cinematography is kinda cool in this, the live action remake, and Willem DaFoe was a good choice as the voice of The Shinigami. Those are about the only positives I can find. The guy who plays Kira is awful. There is really no build up, and an hour & a half isn't close to enough time to build the incredible world in which this story takes place. Seriously tho, watch the original anime. I'm not an anime fanboy by any means but when there's a good plot, it can be one of the best mediums to Effectively tell A story....

usher_679,Psychology and plot,04/10,27-Aug-17,"So first time writing a review. Before watching I wanted to quickly recap the original anime, though it happened to become a binge watching, due to the anime being quite well put. I had a few problems in the way they depict this guy, to fit the story. I noticed that Light(in the anime), was the prep school student, with the all around advantages such athletic skills, the looks and to top it off was very intelligent. This means that the chances for him to become arrogant are very high. Since most people judge people, based on these qualities, in which he excels. So him viewing himself, as some kind of ""god"" and thinking he is better than anyone else actually make sense.However, in the depiction of the character in the movie, he was the usual smart ass loner type of guy, that needed a confirmation of identity and support from a girl and even being pushed by Ryuk. This just changes everything, since he is somewhat being manipulated by Ryuk and the girl. Whereas the original Light is the manipulator.The reason I am looking at the psychology of the characters is that the plot is so damn important, and lays out a foundation for things, such as Psychopathic and narcissistic tendencies Light has in the anime, which makes him unable to love anyone but himself. This also gives rise to answer the question that it makes sense for him to kill so many people, without flinching. When it comes to L, he was surprisingly good depicted by the actor and seemed somewhat believable. So a big applause to him. Of course, the movie seemed to be only made for monetary purposes. Would I watch it, if not for comparing the original? - I highly doubt it and would not recommend it. I was just interested in the what way the plot would be changed and it is not a change I approve of."
markthomassintek,What would you do if you had a power to choose who dies?,09/10,30-Aug-17,"REVIEW - DEATH NOTEWhat would you do if you had a power to choose who dies?Think about it for a second. Would you actually choose someone? Who would you choose? Why? What if you had the power to strike down the most terrible villains and terrorists? Would that alone justify doing so? This is a film to watch and I mean watch well, no distractions, watch and enjoy. A supernatural Romeo and Juliet, law enforcement with a touch of Sherlock thrown in this will appeal. Rating 9 out of 10"
DannyChryst,Stop Ruining Great Anime,01/10,24-Feb-22,"Absolute garbage. I do appreciate that they tried to take many ideas from the anime. They get the basic concepts correct, but the changes to the plot of the source material are unforgivable. Some of the changes were made to create completely unnecessary plot twists which were vastly different from the anime, and ended up being your standard horror clichés. Ryuk was also a lot different from the anime and manga despite being the single element that remained mostly intact. In the anime he acted like he didn't care about what happened with the Death Note, and that made him even more likable as a character. In this film he's portrayed as having sinister urges for how he uses the Death Note, as if he was actually a demon or some kind of evil entity. Ryuk seemed far more neutral towards everything on the show.Light acts like an irrational dunce compared to his criminal mastermind version from the show. Misa, or ""Mia"" in the film, is much more sadistic and conniving than in the anime. Even L has a personality change, but most of his mannerisms remain the same. He too lets his emotions run wild, which is a huge departure from his cold and calculating nature on the show. This is mostly the result of an overly elaborate plot twist that is such a sharp deviation from the source material it makes you wonder if the director even watched the whole series. They also continue to cram in needlessly complicated plot devices that have no place or purpose in a supernatural detective story. On top of that, they keep ripping off various other horror films, and it feels like more of a horror film than a detective story. This is probably their greatest sin of all because it utterly destroys the tone that made the anime so unique to watch. It just becomes another disposable American horror movie which is definitely not what Death Note should have been like.This was easily the worst live-action adaptation of Death Note, and possibly the worst live-action adaptation of any anime period. I didn't think it could get much worse after Ghost In The Shell, but Netflix had to prove me wrong. Hollywood seriously needs to leave anime alone forever."
brokenmind1986,I liked it,08/10,24-Jul-20,"I've never seen or read any of the things this is based on. It sounds like I wouldn't have liked it as much if I had. As a movie that I knew nothing about, I enjoyed it.

ashleypelan,What a complete disservice to the original,01/10,26-Aug-17,"How disappointing. I was originally annoyed with the choice of actors and actresses chosen to play these roles, but thought I could look past it. I couldn't even get 25 minutes in. The personality of the characters was changed, THE NAMES WERE CHANGED, the story was so jumbled and inaccurate. I could not get through this. They should have stuck to more of the original and made this a TV series. There is way too much content in the 37 episodes of Death Note to cram it into an hour and 40 minutes. I wish I could rate it zero.What a bummer.

geekgirl101,More like a movie based on Death Note,03/10,28-Aug-17,"As long as you treat this movie as one based on Death Note then it makes an OK horror movie, however if you've seen the anime then be prepared for disappointment if you expect this movie to resemble anything like the anime. The comparison to the film and the anime version was like the difference between night and day and it felt so rushed and like it was missing too much from the anime.L was just your typical and estranged detective and resembled nothing of the L in the anime. His conclusion to who Kira was was nothing special that anybody could've easily worked out for themselves. He was also taking the Kira case far too personally from the get-go and was more emotional than the eccentric and emotionless L we know in the anime.In the anime the reason it took so long to prove who Kira was was because he was as smart as L so he was always several steps ahead and was able to plan everything so that no solid evidence could prove that he was Kira, but in the movie the whole psychological game was completely missed out. It was only at the very end that Light Turner was comparable to Light Yakamoto in the anime.Ryuk appeared far too early in the movie and was encouraging Light to write names in the book and was manipulative, but in the anime he appeared after Light had already filled in several pages without any influence or encouragement and was amused by Lights' use of the book and finding new ways in which he could get away with writing names in it without being caught.More than half the characters were missing from this movie including M and N and what few characters were in it there was no depth to them and were easily forgettable."
mmcontini-42215,Watchable if you aren't fan of the manga,07/10,17-May-22,"If you didn't read any manga of the series, the movie isn't bad, the idea (taken from the manga) is original, and the soundtrack is awesome.But, the acting is bad and the characters aren't enjoyable in general.

henrybret-77142,"Lots of nerd rage here but, as an objective watcher I liked it.",07/10,28-Aug-17,"I'm not an anime or Manga fan. I thought the movie was decent. The production value and acting was good. The main actor got a lot of grief online for his "" scream"" when he first meets the demon guy or what ever he is but, I've seen high school kids scream like little babies for less. If anything you could argue the scream was too realistic for a movie, though that's a dumb argument. I understand the source material was manga and anime and to die hards I'm sure it sucked comparatively but, It was a neat story with good plot twists . I'd recommend watching it for what it is not for what it is ""supposed to be"" .

NovemberKin,Hideous rendition,02/10,26-Aug-17,"I was very much looking forward to this title and I watched it as soon as it went up on Netflix, already from the start I knew something was of when the poster for DeathNote on Netflix, which was an interesting black and white, threshold type graphic had the words "" ipsum dolor sit amet"", for those who aren't in the know this is the most widely used dummy text to demonstrate typography/fonts and layout of text. I chuckled because clearly someone overlooked this, I did not imagine that this forebode what was to come.The first thing that strikes you as a viewer is that the pace is ludicrous, there is no exposition what so ever, everything just sort of happens, as if you have an effect that was not put in motion by a cause, this persist during the whole movie. We do not psychological understanding of the character Light, therefore you do not sympathize with the character that alone would be enough to ruin a movie but sadly this is one of a horde of problems. The creators of this film were completely directionless, and this does not mean that director himself is to blame, everything is sub- par at best, the script is a complete mess it focuses on all the wrong places. Whereas the anime on which this film is based of focuses on morals and ethics, how can murder of any kind be justified and should some one with the power of life and death be allowed to govern people by his/her sense of justice. The Netflix version instead focuses on being a Twilight version of Natural Born Killers, with pathetic teenage sociopaths rather than a complex intelligent character who plots his every move and decision meticulously. The acting is laughable, it resembles most of the time a parody of the characters they were based on, especially the L character was in the anime a well written antisocial autistic person who had his ticks but was highly intelligent and intuitive, whereas in this adaptation the actor portraying him seems not to act but just play a part, everything about him is fake, even the way his eye moves you can literally see moments when the director says ""look left, now right"". This is not to say that the other actors are with out sin, but the L character stood out because he is a very difficult character to portray because of his quirks. The move tries to be edgy with the inclusion of excessive gore and more swearing than needed, this also comes around as forced and fake. The movie uses a lot of prerecorded music by some popular artist that just functions as a distraction and as most thing in this movie...forced. It is a shame because having someone like Atticus Ross being the composer it is a damn shame he was not used to his full extent. The cinematography was uneven, at times very interesting especially in darker scenes where different light sources have some wild colors, but these scenes where not counterbalanced in high key environments, but this is to be expected by Mr. Tattersall as the cinematographer of the prequel Star Wars movies.The only truly good thing in this movie, and the reason to why I did not rate this movie with 1 star is Willem Dafoe and his portrayal of the shinigami Ryuk and how he was digitally created.The movie as a whole is a underwhelming as best, a extremely loosely based interpretation of Death Note, the best parallel I can make is that this movie to the anime Death Note is like Dragonaball Z is to Dragonball Evolution. I do not recommend this and I would even say to actively avoid this tired prostituted version of the master piece that is the Death Note anime."
logano-911,Will be unsatisfying for fans of the original material.,04/10,29-Aug-17,"I went into this wanting to like it, as I enjoyed the anime very much. That said, it was unsatisfying. I believe this movie would not hold up at all if you were unfamiliar with the original story, and it makes some drastic alterations that ruin the story. You never really felt the cat and mouse suspense that the anime series did so masterfully. Movie was too short to do all of this. Just a few of the unfortunate changes:He got a girlfriend who was writing in the same book the whole time. I was under the impression the owner did the writing. They even said that the book had to be out of your possession for 7 days before you forfeited ownership. What is the point of ownership if anyone can write in it? Even if it is technically possible, it was an overused element.The girl who was writing in the book with him, could not see Ryuk ever. Why not?He never ends up in custody (jail), and the element from the original material where people were still dying while he was in jail under 24/7 observation as the suspect was totally missing. That was a huge omission/deletion. L basically magically knows Kira is Light almost immediately. No build up or mind trickery to that part at all.Apparently in this world, you can write long and complex ways of death with no limitations other than ""physically possible"", to the point of writing a 2 page essay which turns the target into a mind- controlled zombie for up to TWO days (see FBI agents, Otari, and the final manipulation of the doctor and child molester)He never gets L's name. L and Light never ""work together"" for even a second which made Light's subterfuge that much more evil in the original material. They were never really adversaries at all. Bummer.The movie had no ending. Light is in the hospital, his dad now knows, and L found the Death Note page with the 12 FBI agents names, and he knows for sure. Now what? L proving it for the powers that be, and any resolution or punishment never happened.The only good thing was Ryuk, and Willem Dafoe was a good choice for the voice. It worked. However, I think Ryuk was terribly underutilized, and never really explained at all, and the lack of any other shinigami or Ryuk in hell chatting with the others, explaining more details about their existence would have been great. So in summary, this was a disappointing alteration of the story. It had the production quality and good actors, just the story was chopped and hacked to the point of being different, and the suspense was never there. If a viewer were totally unfamiliar with the lore, a viewer would probably be lost completely. It should have been a 3 part series, at a minimum in my opinion. There was no other way to cover the material without wrecking the story.Maybe this will raise awareness of the anime for people who haven't seen that yet. The level of huge plot and rule changes in this movie mean there is absolutely nothing to spoil the original story. Oh well."

Casting choices are incredibly bad, not a single character from the anime is portrayed even somewhat correctly. Story is generic. Everything that made the anime so great is completely stripped from this film. If you ever want to drink bleach, now is the time.

zoliking,What the ever living f?,01/10,17-Dec-21,"There's a difference in making creative choices for an adaptaion and flipping everything upside down until there is nothing left of the original work. For example changing the location makes sense: the story being set in Japan is in no way integral to the plot, many characters were American anyway, there's no language issue and production for an American company is gonna be a lot easier in America. Makes perfect sense.Taking the main characters and flipping their personalities to their polar opposites for no reason is not a creative choice, it's just a complete refusal to try to do an adaptation of preexisting material. It's themeing a vastly inferior story with the veneer of the most external characteristics of the ""original"". Quotation marks because at this point it's not even an adaptation, just a farce.Everybody who participated in putting this script together is fatally stupid and should never be allowed to write screenplays again."
ChristianSlater4000,Better than the source material,10/10,29-Nov-21,"My name is Tobias Gilbert, and I watched this film whilst bench pressing 570 pounds. This film not only exceeds the source material of the original Chinese version, but vastly somehow exceeds it. It is nearly identical to the anime, but every character has been improved upon. Give this review a thumbs up if you agree, dislike and I'll shut up.

monalpy,Stupid people rating,10/10,06-Mar-20,"Starting today I will no longer look at their rating when deciding to watch a movie. This was excellent and kept me interested and entertained. Rated it a 10 to increase the rating (would put it at a 7/7,5) and expose it to more people for the great movie it is - would love a sequel.

dustinfrench,Such a disappointment,01/10,26-Aug-17,"This remake is just awful. Very little is related to the Anime. No stoicism. I'm watching it as I write this review. 30 minutes in and it is PAINFUL. Watch the original anime. If you've already seen that, then give the Netflix remake 10 minutes of your time. It deserves more negative reviews.

j_forbesy,Death Note Review,03/10,25-Aug-17,"Death Note is an anime series that I only recently watched. It's a series that I overall really enjoy despite feeling as though it dropped off in the back end. Despite that however, I saw that there was enough there that I felt a good movie could be made from.There is only one way to sum up the Death Note Netflix movie, it is just straight up awful. Whether I view it as an adaption of the source material, or just as an original movie, it doesn't change the overall quality if it.Starting on the adaptation point of view, this adaptation failed to catch the aspect of the anime that I myself really enjoyed. I had three aspects that I felt like they had to get right and that was the relationship between Light and Ryuk, the battle of wits between Light and L and the legend of Kira.In this film Ryuk served close to no purpose apart from give some early explanation and just hang around in the background. The character of Ryuk in this film seemed more like a version of a devil rather than a smart ass death god like in the anime. If I do have to give some credit to Ryuk in this film, it would be that William Dafoe really nailed the voice. Going into the film I had no doubt that his voice was perfectly suited for the role, however they didn't even get close to using the character to it's full potential. Moving onto the battle of wits between Light and L, it was basically non-existence. While there was a few moments that they showed that L had a form of intelligence in catching Kira, I never felt like L could realistically work out all the information he knew just from doing what he had done on screen.The legend of Kira was one of my favourite parts of the anime, however it was one of my least favourite parts of the film. Kira as a concept worked in the anime because it was a community given name that Light took on. He filled the void of a god that the community had asked for. Where in the film, it is Light that decides he wants to be known as Kira and because of that it changes the meaning around Kira. Kira is no longer a savour that the community worship but a guy that just wants to toots his own horn.Stepping back from the point of view of an adaptation, this film still had to work as a film and sadly it didn't. We had an extremely forces romantic plot line that had no chemistry at all. Majority of the acting was really flat, which is both on the actors and actresses as well as the dialog and director. The overall story felt really rushed and most of the time I only was able to understand what they were trying to do is because they had hand picked moments from the anime. The moments they did pick from the anime often lost their meaning and context because they had not been present in the way the anime had.After watching this film I went back and refreshed myself on how the story is structured in the anime, which made me dislike this film more. In the first two episodes of the anime they establish Kira as this community built belief, they form a great back and forth relationship with Light and Ryuk, and they gave a strong introduction to L and had a great display of L playing mind games with Light. That was all in the first 40 minutes of the series. While I know all adaptation don't have to be completely accurate, I felt that the concepts and set up done by the anime in 40 minutes was much more stronger than what the film managed to do in an hour and a half.Overall, while I wasn't too excited for this film based off the trailers, I was still intrigued enough to see what they could do with the source material. What is so disappointing is that it was not only a massive disservice to the source material, but was a disservice to film making itself that what little moments of good the film did have barely shone through the cracks.3/10"
bxd109,I didn't like it :),04/10,26-Aug-17,"Okay so the death note movie was horrible because it reminded me of final destination and because i spent half of the movie wondering where i saw that guy to remember that he was the guy who played the role of the *uselessiest character in the history of movies in the film paper towns (which i hated; both the movie and characters) and the guy who played L's role whose Japanese to his taste in sweets made me cringe till the end so if there's one thing this Netflix movie succeeded at was to remind me of the worst movies i have seen and at the end it became one of them. needless to say, Ryuk was the ONLY character that pleased me and he shall always remain as my favorite character in death note. Bravo Netflix!

turkeve,Give it a try,07/10,01-Sep-17,"I watched both the anime, and the film, and with this experience I can say that the film is enjoyable, if you aren't compare the film to the anime, because it's completely different. Firstly, the film located in the USA, not in Japan. The names of the characters are different (Light Turner, not Yagami Light), so as their personality (for example Misa personality I think is not well planed in the movie, and a bit stupider too, and Light is acting more like a real, flesh made human in the movie). But there are some dumm things too. (SPOILER ALERT) The character of L, at the beginning of the film is doing great, but lately it becames the best detective in the frecking universe, he solved the Kira case about 30 minutes (from the movie time), so it's a bit fast for me. Ryuk animation is good too (motion capture). So, in a conclusion, I suggest this film to the people, who don't wanna see the anime again as a live-acting movie.

MSFTGhoul,Fun Movie,09/10,26-Aug-17,"Death Note was a fun movie. It differed from the manga and anime in lots of ways, which is to expected. Don't come into the movie and expect everything to be the same. Also, I came into the movie already expecting it to feel rushed and skip past many things, judging by the run-time of the movie. The actor for L did a lot better than I had pre-judged based on the trailer. Near the end his actions are a little wack and surprising but since this isn't the manga, I excuse it. I liked Light, near the beginning I wasn't sure but the end made me go WOW that was perfect. Mia was decent character. Light's dad was perfect. Ryuk is more cruel than he was in the manga, but it was FANTASTIC. Ryuk = PERFECTAs for the story, lots of it feels rushed. Doesn't show much of the over 400 murders it keeps talking about. Wish it had a bigger montage of Light killing criminals. Skips past a lot of the testing the Death Note and rules. L almost immediately deduces that Light is Kira. SPOILER: Light practically admits he's Kira to L in their first meeting. Doesn't even try to hide it from him. But as I said I was already expecting a lot of rushed feeling based on the run-time of the movie. Should of been at least an hour longer or a been a TV series. The L and Light chase scene was weird to me and didn't seem executed that good because it seemed so typical in the running through buildings, all that stuff you see in tons of action movies. The ending though! It shows the genius side of Light for pretty much the only time in the movie, but it was PERFECT. Major cliffhanger though which makes me hope for a sequel. I loved the ending, it had me going WOW. Now that's Death Note!"
harm-78042,Disgrace to the source material & awful movie,02/10,27-Aug-17,"Basically: do not waste your time and (re)watch the original 'Death Note' animation instead.Main downfalls: - Plot holes - Unnecessary moments of gore - Improper casting - Cliché high school scenario: bullies, cheerleaders and a football team - Unrealistic charactersLet's start off with the main character. In the starting premise, if actually killing a person isn't strange enough let's brag about it the next day to some girl. In the original, Light went through a rough transition capturing the mental struggles - it is essential for a believable story on which it fails throughout the film. Furthermore, the main actor excels in some comedic scenes, and I feel he should work on more light-hearted movies - wrong cast (also for all of the side actors, except Ryuk).In one of the first scenes, Watari explicitly wants to meet with the father of Light - huh? There are higher odds of winning the lottery, twice in a row. Even worse, that if L added potential suspects for Kira to kill, then why would he not check the logging of the persons who accessed this? The story is just full of plot holes right off the get-go.My intention was to give it a 1/10 rating, however, some parts are somewhat innovative regarding characters and events. Still, it is not worth your time and I sincerely hope the Death Note author will not see it. Note, I'm not against a overhauled Americanized Death Note, as I would even enjoy mayor changes, but this movie is just plain bad. Overall, a terrible story, told terribly with terrible characters."
willgross,A review from someone who isn't familiar with the source material,05/10,26-Aug-17,"The following review is spoiler free.This movie—and the reaction to it—makes me contemplate how much one's response to a much anticipated sequel, reboot, or adaptation can vary depending on how familiar with or emotionally attached you are to the source material.Full disclosure: I watched this film with zero knowledge of the property on which it is based. With that in mind, I can't bandwagon on any fan based criticisms about what the movie ""got wrong"" about the details of the mythology or characters.What I will say—as a member of the uninitiated, writing this with other unknowing but curious potential viewers in mind—is that the film has some slick cinematography, a pretty good score, and a cast doing their best with dialogue that is often stupid, but never laughably so. I didn't hate the movie and wouldn't call it terrible.Having said that, I can't really call it good either. It's probably been said too many times already by now, but watching this film is less like watching a movie and more like watching a 100-minute long trailer for one. This is owed to a script that seemingly packs an entire TV season's worth of plot into a single film. Niceties like character development and tension building are pretty much absent here. The movie simply doesn't have time as it rushes from one plot point to the next.To be effective, generally a film should spend more time fleshing things out. Plot points flew at me so fast, at times I felt like I had whiplash. The movie is overstuffed and convoluted. Any interesting themes suggested by its premise are entirely absent. Substance, you will not find here. I may not be familiar with the Japanese original, but the film seems like a waste of an intriguing premise, too bogged down in unconvincing world building to say anything impactful, or make you feel much.Again, the cast (with the possible exception of Willem Dafoe, who hams it the F up with a character more than a little reminiscent of the Green Goblin) is fine. They are doing a fine job with the material they are given. The cinematography and lightning are great looking. The score has a very retro 80s synth vibe to it. And I do find the premise interesting, even if I found the execution rushed and overstuffed. If you are interested in those things and don't care if the movie is completely lacking in scares, subtext, or much emotional impact, feel free to give it a watch. Otherwise, stay away."
D_E_Morgan,An enjoyable film that stands on its own.,07/10,26-Aug-17,"I just finished watching this film and thoroughly enjoyed it. With no prior exposure to any of the past source material I went in with no set expectations. I feel that allowed me to just sit back and be drawn into the original story line and believable but not overused cgi. Casting William Dafoe as Ryuk was a smart move due to his superb control over tone and pitch. I would however have liked to have seen better use of motion capture to capitalize on Dafoe's mannerisms and character driven performance. He seemed to get lost in the cgi at times and due to this the character occasionally seemed 2 dimensional. The rest of the cast held their own throughout the film but laKeith Stanfield made the most of his dialogue and became the driving force in the majority of the scenes he was in. The plot was well rounded and you could tell effort had been made to maintain continuity which is something I appreciate. So often movies this day in age toss plots and continuity to the curb in favour of larger special effects and easy to follow story lines. The cinematography was spot on and worked well with the lighting direction and selected filming locations. The pacing was right where it should have been and because of this maintained my interest throughout the film. Overall a decent script, some good acting, solid special effects and an interesting story line made for an enjoyable experience."
totorototoro,Not much to enjoy,01/10,12-Dec-17,"It was obvious that this movie never would have the same sort of feeling to it as the anime. But I was suprised to find no traces at all when it came to any of the characters or evolving of the story. The movie is filled with moments when you realize the writes just didnt give a sh*t. 
Light is slightly douchy, makes some ""funny"" oneliners now and again. He gives away being a murderer to a girl he has talked to for 20 seconds (and that after she has sold him out earlier). Very strange. He seemed to hesitate before the first murder, but that changed with one ""aww come one"" from Ryuk.The story is very weak. The characters are neither likable nor belivable. Disappointing on many levels."

ehhmil,Missed potential.,03/10,25-Aug-17,"I want to start off by saying that I have not seen or read either the anime or the original manga. So I will not address any of the changes made from the source material to this movie.The story revolves around Light Turner, a kid who takes the law into his own hands by using something called a Death Note, a book where he can kill people by specifying name and way- of-death according to a set of rules.The concept is one that have intrigued me since i heard of the anime several years ago, I just haven't gotten around to it but I was excited to see it be turned into live action. What really got me hooked was the short clip of when Light meets Ryuk where Willem Defoes voice almost gave me shivers.So what did we end up with? I can summarize it as a really depressing amount of lost potential.The story did initially reel me in, but the lack of digging into the characters traits and motivations and the extremely fast paced progression just got me to lose interest. At the end i didn't really root for anyone because i hadn't spent enough time with any of the characters to actually care. Which meant that at the big open-ended finishing scene I was just happy the film was over.What really depresses me about this isn't that the rushed story was bad, there are too many bad movies out there to be sad about every one of them. But the fact that it really did have a lot of potential makes it feel like an even bigger loss that the story was such a let down.What I did like was the characters and the acting. I enjoyed Light, other than a few freak- out scenes that felt a bit forced I really believed in his reactions to the situation he had found himself in. His initial back and forth with Ryuk was very entertaining and the dynamic he had with Mia felt very real. Willem Defoes voice as Ryuk was perfect, it stole every scene he was in. And lastly Lakeith Stanfield as L really locked the casting down as one of the highlights of the movie to me.The other highlight was the theme in the movie, the darkness, the rain and everything in the environment just constantly nudged me to really like the movie but it still just couldn't save the movie.So is it a bad movie? Yes, unfortunately it is. But I feel like if it had just been allowed the time to grow, to have more moments to establish characters, to give us some time to breathe and absorb what happens and for the plot to actually itself have time to reflect on what is happening, I would say that to me, this could have been the show of the year. But in the end it falls short, with a bittersweet foundation that really teases us what an amazing show it really could have been."
villibodin,Just why?,01/10,28-Feb-21,"Okay, this movie was probably the most dissapointing movie ever! I really loves the original anime, but this!? I really hated the movie, the actors were so bad! In the anime Light have brown hair and in this he have blond hair, and in the anime Light's dad have glasses and mustache. If you love the original anime DONT WATCH THIS, you Will get really dissapointed. It wouldn't suprise me if the director of this movie haven't Even watched the anime."
MarwanTemeza,Disappointment,01/10,27-Aug-17,i stopped after 13 minutes of watching. This adaption of Death Note is worst till today. why? because nothing in this movie was related to the original Death Note. they failed to include the obvious moments of the original series when for example Mia touched the note book but didn't see Ryuk. I do not recommend watching this movie if you are a fan or not because you will be disappointed either way.
Adele666,"Terrible Movie, Do Not Watch it",03/10,27-Feb-20,"It is terrible. If you are interested in Death Note this will stop it. Please do not watch this.

goodman528,"Excellent movie, much better than the manga and anime",10/10,04-Sep-17,"This movie deserves a sequel. It is a rare example of an anime adaptation done right. I think from the script and editing it is clear to see this was made as a labor of love. The acting is fantastic and the plot line is very tight, there isn't any spare lines nor spare scenes in this movie. It is a very lean 90 minutes with no fillers.I have read the manga and watched the anime over 10 years ago. Trust me, this movie is much better than both the manga and the anime. I know there are a lot of very angry fans who don't like how it is unfaithful to the source material. There is also a lot of nerd rage by the keyboard lawyers who argue the story logic is full of holes when you consider the rules of the death note. They are missing the point. This movie is about the core concept of ""what would you do if you were given the power of life and death?"" in an American setting. It's no longer about the logic game of rules and deduction and out-smarting your opponent, which the original Japanese source material focused on.If you are a big fan of the original manga/anime, then honestly this movie is not going to give you more of the same. To you I would recommend similar manga/anime such as Liar Game, Sanctuary, Kaiji, One Outs, etc. If you are new and haven't seen much of the original manga/anime, then don't listen to the angry fan-boys. They are wrong. Watch the movie and make up your own mind."
johnny_joko,Don't watch if you are gonna compare it to the anime,04/10,20-May-20,"After 3 years of this movie's release date, I finally decided to watch it. The reason I hadn't watched it for so long was that I was a huge fan of the Death Note manga and anime and I just felt that this one was just going to be a complete train wreck of a film. Now that I have seen it, I thought it would be good to write down some of my thoughts on it.1. If you are looking for a film that relies heavily on the anime, don't even think about watching this. The only thing that is the same is Light's name (though he is called Light Turner and not Yagami Light), L's name, Watari's name and Ryuk.
2. Ryuk is the best thing about this one as he looks very good and I think that it's a nice depiction of the original Ryuk from the anime. Would have liked to see him a little more though as his screen time is barely even 10 minutes.
3. Light Turner has NOTHING to do with Yagami Light. His appearance doesn't remotely look close to Yagami and neither he views himself as a god, he is just an emo guy that was bullied at school and was bit of a loner.
4. L has NOTHING to do with his anime counterpart either. First of all, he's black and second of all his character is a polar opposite of the cool minded L of the anime. In the movie, L is violent and a hot headed individual who, although smart, jumps to conclusions.
5. Mia is the film's adaptation of Misa but in this one, instead of her being obsessed with Light, she seems more obsessed with obtaining the Death Note and going on a mindless killing spree.
6. L seems to be WAY smarter than Light which wasn't the case in the anime, as they were both equally smart, with Light finally outsmarting L before L's death.
7. The acting isn't good by any chance, it's just barely mediocre.
8. The ending was pretty good, I'll give them that.
To sum up, this one is about an hour and a half long. If you are willing to completely disregard the fact that this one is called Death Note, then you will find it as an ok movie to spare 90 minutes of your day. If you even think about starting to compare it to the original then this one barely gets 1/10. I decided to do the first one and rate it as a 4/10. Definitely NOT something I would revisit at any point..."
mwp-036,Don't expect it to be exactly the same!,08/10,25-Aug-17,"Too many reviewers on here are missing the point. If you want to watch the Death Note anime again, then go watch the Death Note anime again. This is an entire 40-something episode anime condensed into about an hour and a half live-action movie, so of course there are going to be a lot of changes. Light is not as smart as he was in the original, the setting is Seattle instead of Japan, and many other elements are changed or completely removed. There's no scenes where Light is held captive by the police to see if he's Kira. He never passes on the Death Note to lose his memory. L doesn't die, and neither does Light's father. L also seems much more energetic and emotional than in the anime. I could go on, there are many more changes that greatly affect the story. Instead of watching this movie expecting it to be exactly the same in every way, try watching it on its own merit as a movie. Forget what you know about Death Note, since most things are changed. This movie was well-made, and the acting is at least decent, even if it's not quite Hollywood blockbuster quality. Willem Defoe was fantastic as Ryuk, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who thought he would be great as Ryuk when watching the original anime before this casting was even announced. The actor who played L was very good as well. The score felt like a movie from the 1980's, full of synthesized beats that made the action scenes feel fast and frantic. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the live-action Death Note. I find it nearly impossible to compare it to the anime, since they're so completely different both in style and substance. But if you're a fan of the original and can watch it for its own merit rather than expecting more of the same, then you may be surprised."
elmubavi,An insult to the original Death Note series,01/10,26-Aug-17,"If you have watched the series, you will hate it. If you have not, perhaps you will never watch the actual series. Characters have been portrayed in the worst possible way and is nowhere close to the actual series. It's essence and the whole intellectual content which makes the whole series so appealing has vanished. It seems to be made by a person who has not watched the series properly and probably knows nothing about the characters.

madspike212,Well where do you start?...... It could have been much much better...,04/10,05-Sep-17,"I will start off by saying that this adaption is no way near as good as the series. If you're expecting a great movie of Death Note then quickly change them expectations.On a whole the movie delivers a Death Note story. Same principle and the same characters. Trouble is the characters are not the same as in the series and they have changed some of the rules to how the death note works. This is what really breaks the movie in two. The fact that they did not stick to the original story and rules makes the whole experience for a true Death Note fan a big flop. I imagine for anyone that has not indulged in the series would find it pretty fresh, but if you know where its base lines are you will be disappointed.This is why I gave the movie a rating of 4 out of 10, because if you did not follow the series you can still enjoy the movie. Willem Dafoe does a great adaption of Ryuk. Not greatly the same as the series but a great version none the less (I would not be surprised if he was a big selling point by being Ryuk. I couldn't see anyone playing him better). The plot of the film is just as the series is too. It just does not flow as well as the series because they are trying to stick the whole idea into a short movie. This really destroys the aspect of the real feud that should go on between Light and ""L"". There is a good twist for the end though.Like I say its a 4. It could have been done much better. They could have even told it with the promise of a sequel and told a better version. For now though I will say it is okay enough. It is an American adaption of a Japanese great. Sometimes the USA just cant do it justice. Worth a watch but if you know the series, try not to get to upset."
ultroks,Another American teen drama with supernatural elements.,05/10,28-Aug-17,"Light is typical high school student who gets mysterious notebook that has power to kill other people by writing their names. The note have many rules and is owned by Death God named Ryuk who supervises him. With such power Light Decides to start killing bad people with that and create new persona called Kira very soon he shares the secret with his crush Mia, and they end up together in all these. In meantime L, the so called greatest detective in the world start pursuing the Kira.I usually don't compare movie to the original source much but they pretty much miss the whole point and philosophy of the original. They really trying to make it original and different as much they could, keeping just the basic things. so they change almost everything, from the characters and their motives to story and even basic rules of Death Notes.It feels the main character are rewritten to be appealing to the teens. Light is stereotypical generic guy, without any brilliance he suppose to have, Mia is edgy and arrogant. and L who suppose to be greatest detective and to differ from others surely end up just like another ordinary teen, It surely doesn't feel like he is genius nor detective at all. Acting was decent I guess, nothing too bad. Nat Wolff acting is weak and goofy at the moments but it is tolerable. Lakeith Stanfield on the other hand, I think did very good job,The guy really tried and done fine performance with the script he got.There are a couple of flaws and mistakes especially in the beginning like when Mia somehow see the name Death Note even tho she is on Light's right side while by how Light is sitting and holding note, its written on left cover making it technically impossible to notice just like that. Or after Ryuk first appear by making such a mess in classroom and nobody mention that, i mean it surely is big deal especially the assets that was broken.The best thing about the movies is Ryuk, Dafoe did excellent job by giving voiceEnding is left uncertain by intention, leaving the possibility for sequelI must admit, It have some cool scenes especially with Ryuk. But overall nothing worth watching. Tho It probably will be interesting for teens who are unfamiliar with anime and manga."

educallejero,"""Adaptation""",02/10,01-Sep-20,"More like destruction.
Destruction of the overall story, and more importantly the every single important character. They forced the nuanced (somewhat at least) characters in the original into the typical american stereotypes, and then they forced them to commit incoherent actions to force the story to where it supposed to go.The worse part of all, they weren't even coherent to the adaptation itself. It's really hard to explain how and why.

TheMovieDoctorful,"The Starship Troopers of the 21st Century, The Most Underrated Film of 2017",10/10,20-Aug-18,"Great satire is rarely recognized in its own time. That goes double when said satirical material is genuinely ambitious and technically impressive. That goes triple when said satirical material is an adaptation of a beloved IP. Films like Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers and the especially reviled Showgirls were met with mass critical panning on release, it wasn't until over a decade later that they would gain appreciation from the critics who once slammed them. So it makes sense that the initial reception to Adam Wingard's Death Note is almost universally negative. However, much like the reception of the aforementioned films, the critics and audiences are again wrong. Death Note is the most clever, interesting, well made and misunderstood social critique since Showgirls and easily the most underrated film of 2017. Furthermore, I would make the argument that the film is actually superior to the anime in which it is based on, which unintentionally fed the juvenile power fantasies of too many a teenage boy.Unlike Light Yagami, the unironically edgy and seemingly invulnerable Gary Stu of the anime, Nat Wolff's Light Turner possesses a genuine pathos. The arrogance, entitlement and narcissism of his anime counterpart are still present, but Wolff imbues the character with a deep insecurity and sensitivity that Yagami never had. The screenwriters never make the mistake of justifying Turner's God complex or making him sympathetic; he's a selfish, naive teenager in way over his head. Light Turner is not only an effective allegory for entitled and pathetic school shooter youth a la Elliot Rodger, but for every mouth-breathing, edgelord fanboy of the anime who unironically idolized Light Yagami; unsubstantial, pretentious, vulnerable and cowardly. Light Turner is simultaneously amusing and tragic, as is his narrative downfall.And how fitting it is for a critique of entitled edgelord youth to take Misa Amane, Yagami's obedient sex object from the anime, and transform her into Mia Sutton, the ruthless, manipulative, calculating and intelligent seductress played by Margaret Qualley? (Who makes a hard and convincing case in this film for playing a teenage Poison Ivy in the DCEU.) Qualley steals the show as Sutton, giving easily the best performance in the film as every Yagami worshiper's worst nightmare; an uncontrollable and untameable force of nature, unfazed by Turner's adoration and unconvinced by his insistence of a moral highground. ""You don't get to feel superior for being a p*ssy."" she tells Light. Qualley's biting delivery perfectly sells the hard truth of her words. At the same time, Qualley's Mia does evoke a genuine sympathy that a lesser actress may not have achieved. She's a character who isn't taken seriously or respected by anyone; not even her supposedly loving boyfriend. While not overplayed, Qualley does an excellent job displaying this disappointment and hurt in Mia in her facial acting.Shea Wingham gives a powerful and nuanced performance as Light Turner's father, Detective James Turner. Fiercely protective of his unworthy son, the inevitability of the collapse of their relationship hangs over their every interaction, even as it seemingly grows warmer over the course of the film. This is the core of truly great tragedy; the certainty of its arrival and the false hopes of the audience that things can end any other way.Lakeith Stanfield does for L what Heath Ledger did for The Joker, what he pulls off is extraordinarily transformative. From his physical mannerisms to his vocal ticks to his subtle facial expressions, Stanfield is an anime character brought to life in glorious fashion. Much like Wolff's Light, Stanfield's L has a real emotional vulnerability and sensitivity that was never present in the anime incarnation. L may be brilliant and eccentric, but he is also breakable and fallible. Capable of being pushed too far. I found him truly fascinating.Fanboys will pine for the ultra-serious and nihlistic tone of the anime. Wingard's Death Note brings self awareness to the material and a brilliant sense of dark humor. The film's gore is increased from the anime to an almost cartoonish degree, straight out of the most ludicrous and over-the-top fantasies of an Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold. Much of the soundtrack almost appears mocking and condescending of Light and his pathetic struggle for mass validation. This is satire at its finest.The direction of the film is gorgeous. Much like the aforementioned Showgirls, Wingard uses aesthetic beauty and grandeur as a visual metaphor for the ""All that glimmers isn't gold"" themes of the film. Particularly effective is a scene in which Light is reunited with Mia after discovering her treachery, the beautiful Qualley almost sparkling aside packs of teenagers that may as well be faceless. Qualley's Mia is most enchanting at her most dangerous and independent and the cinematography reflects that. Even more effective is the film's climax on the Seattle Great Wheel, in which Light experiences the grand finale of all his failures and the ultimate cost of his unjustified hubris.Speaking of, the climax of Death Note is everything it needed to be. Chicago's ""I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love"" is hilarious when juxtaposed with Light's deepest low of the film. Conversely, the later image of Light Turner in tears at a hospital bed in light of everything he lost in his misguided quest for validation and godhood is hard not to be affected by (In no small part due to Nat Wolff's outstanding facial acting. ""I thought it was simple at first, I'd just kill all the bad guys and the good guys would win but it wasn't like that,"" he cries.)Netflix's Death Note is easily the most underrated film of 2017 and I firmly believe it will find its audience as a future cult classic. A funny, emotional, tragic and beautiful satirical work that's merely waiting for the fanboy fervor to slow down and critical reappraisal to begin. A much more self aware, and more intelligent, story than the anime and a wonderfully post-modern critique of edgelord and school shooter youth. Paul Verhoeven would have loved Adam Wingard's Death Note."
cecilnephilim,Entertaining,08/10,26-Aug-17,"I have read the manga and seen the anime and I liked what I have seen. Do not expect the original story but if a film with the bases of the manga, winks and an entertainment that keeps you attentive to the screen throughout the movie. It is not a blockbuster, it is not a movie, but it fulfills its mission that is to entertain and keep you intrigued until the end.

thefolenangel,"If you expect this to be Death Note, run away!!!!!",01/10,25-Aug-17,"Its a truth of life that real life movies based on animes suck, however no one prepared me for this!This is Americanized story is so messed, that if you have come to watch Dead note - as i did, it will blow your mind.First lets start with the fact that everything is moved to America - > but the original characters names are kept, its awkward?Character motivation is changed to a level, where you can not recognize the characters you once liked. For example Kira / Light, in the original used the girl to achieve his goals, he was smart, he wanted to build his own world, where he would be a God. In this Hollywood pigwash, he shares his secret i.e the Death Note with a girl in order to impress her?!? WHAT.To sum it up. RUN AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!"
Lawdog67,Decent Late-Night Movie,07/10,29-Aug-17,"I won't go into detail discussing the ins and outs of the movie. What I WILL do is grade it based on its own merits, and without complaining about how unfaithful it is to some Japanese comic. I've seen review after negative review on here by users, and even the ""Roger Ebert"" external review, and all suffer from the same problem: they are passionately-written teardowns from the vantage point of those who are fans of the original comic work.But what if you're not one of those? I've never even heard the term ""manga"" before, and I don't care which character is based on which in some foreign source material. The movie is plenty entertaining on its own.I do understand the temptation to compare; if anyone has ever read a book that a movie's based on, then seen the movie, it's almost impossible to not draw comparisons. But it also bears repeating: there are millions of Netflix viewers who are not into some esoteric Japanese comic strip. You do them a disservice when you rip into a movie like this based only on your dashed expectations.I went into this movie without any such bias and I found it different and somewhat captivating. It gives the viewer plenty to think about as it winds along to its semi-unpredictable ending. I'd recommend it to anyone else who, like me, is going to view it for its own sake, not to see how it stacks up to the original."
miss-62350,Never saw the Japanese manga so I really enjoyed this movie,07/10,02-May-23,"I really enjoyed this movie, having never seen nor heard about the Japanese manga it's based on, I can't compare this movie to it, therefore as a supernatural thriller, it's not a horror movie to me, it was very entertaining, something very different and it kept my interest throughout. The ending was unfinished to me, therefore leaving a window open for a sequel. I'm hoping there will be a part two, I'm intrigued. However seeing the number of negative reviews that might not happen, most negative reviews are from people who have seen the Japanese manga. I say give it a try, check it out, you should be entertained.

kishimushisushi,Good but could have been better,07/10,25-Aug-17,Death Note. One of the masterpiece anime which was ever created given a one more Live Action Adaption. This movie is good but as compare to original anime it does not stand a chance. The certain twist and turn of events between Light and L that made the anime great which lacks in this movie. There were many things which was supposed to be close to the original material which has made this a masterpiece. If you are changing the characters to this extent than don't use the original characters instead try creating a new ones.**SPOILERS**First of all Light was supposed to be most intelligent self centered self proclaimed God which is complete opposite in this movie. Light in movie is somehow a lover boy who does not even using his intelligence and skills.L was supposed to be the smartest detective who has outsmarted Light in anime but in this movie he is barely using those skills. He is portrayed as an emotional character which is complete opposite to anime character.Regarding Ryuk William Dafoe did great role portraying him but what lacks is that Ryuk was supposed to be neutral character and he wasn't supposed to be manipulating Light into writing names into Death Note.There are many plot holes can be seen in this movie like ***SPOILERS*** if Ryuk was so much helping Light by killing those 12 detectives then why didn't he killed L directly to help light. In anime person was able to see Ryuk after touching the note but same case not happened in film.Many characters were not even there and there was not even discussion about the Shinigami Eyes. Overall experience movie is good. Only if they tried to stick to the original content more would have made this movie much better.

adrianlarsen,"Death Note 2017 - Nice shots, terribly paced.",04/10,24-Feb-23,"Netflix's Death Note from 2017 is an american take on the japanese manga from 2003. The story follows master student Light, who finds a book that allows him to kill whoever he wants. Along with it comes Ryuk, Death God and owner of the book.In the show, Ryuk is a spectator & the only ones who can see him, are the ones who've touched the book. In this? Forget what you know.This movie changes names, locations, ethnicity's (yes really) motivations. They even change main character halfway through....In the show, Light is a master student, which is a common thing in Japan, not so much in USA.

pedroquintaoo,I loved (But I haven't seen the anime),09/10,11-Sep-17,"My expectations about Death Note were so low because I hated Adam Wingard's last film (Blair Witch) and the reviews about Death Note were being so so so bad.However I decided to watch the film, I didn't know anything about the main story because I haven't seen the original anime. In the beginning we see Light getting the death note and then a bunch of deaths starts and the world starts to investigate. I know the fans of the anime hate, I also hated some movies about some books I've read. But in my opinion, the main story was so good, so thrilling, full of good characters (L could be better tho), intense death scenes and amazing plot twists.For me was one of the best mainstream movies of this year.Rating: 8.5/10

Alexander_Blanchett,Wasted opportunity,05/10,14-Sep-17,Its a good concept for a horror film and about questioning your own morals. Its a decent story as well but I had a big problem with the direction which seemed very much out of place at times. Sure Adam Wingard created some atmosphere in certain moments of the film but generally his creative choices were questionable. I also was not a fan of the cast with the exception of Shea Whigham who once again gives a great performance. He really needs bigger roles in more relevant movies. Great actor. Nat Wolff was the wrong choice for the leading role. I did not think he suited the role at all. Probably appeared to be to too old. Laketih Stanfield is a very charismatic and generally talented actor but he overdid his role to a point where I did not take him seriously anymore. Never really bought his character. Willem Dafoe gave a great voice performance and his Ryuk was the highlight of the film for sure. The soundtrack was good but also weird at some points of the film (like the ending but so weird that it was almost cool again) . Oh yeah and the ending no I did not like it. Well a film with some moments but generally a wasted opportunity.
Andres-Camara,"What a waste, with what could have been",04/10,30-Dec-17,"I mean, the premise is very good. The idea is very good, but what a way to spoil it. The movie starts fatal. Then it seems that it is corrected, but in the end it falls completely. It is clear that justice can not be taken by someone on their own, but I do not think that if what happened in the film happens, nobody in the street complains.One thing that takes me completely out of the movie is music, it can not be worse chosen. It is supposed to be fear, intrigue, terror and music is anything but that.The actors are pretty good and how they advance their characters are pretty good, it's a shame that so many things in the movie hurt.
The monster, which should be very important, does not have it in the movie. When you see it, it does not tell you anything. He is an important character in the film, but he does not contribute, he has no strength.Photography is good. It puts you in the movie. It's pretty and gives the touch to intrigue you, suspense.The problem is that it is very badly worn. At first it takes a long time to start, start with unimportant things. When it grows it escapes him and he does not even notice it. He does not know how to carry it. He does not know how to make a beautiful shot. He does not know how to put the camera where it should go and worse, it does not take into account all the parameters to make a good movie.Anyway, do not bother to see her."
mayaajey,What was that?!,01/10,30-Oct-21,"This movie was atrocious in any way possible. The story was way too far from the original one. Death Note is a masterpiece and unfortunately this movie ruined it.I'm gonna start with the things that I did like the most about the film: NONENow I'm gonna say the things that I didn't like:1. The pacing of the story was too fast. The story development felt too rush to me. For this reason I didn't get most part of the movie. I kept telling myself: What in the world is happening?!?2. Couldn't understand what the people were saying in the film. Why were their voices so low?3. The characters were off almost all the time, especially the MC. Light is far from the original Light Yagami. First of all why in this adaptation Light lookes like the usual loser that we find in almost any drama/film? That's wrong, Light Yagami should be smart and someone who should be able to take care of himself, like a model student; he should be confident, strong and not someone who is bullied and cries all the time. Who in the world is this new stranger character?? Plus why did they call it Light Turner?? Could they have kept the original surname ?? And what's up with his hair?? Like...really??4. The story was all messed up. Light Yagami was supposed to be the evil guy, who enjoys killing criminal people, while Ryuk was supposed to be neutral. In this movie is basically the opposite. Actually Light appears to be much more innocent than he should...5. Almost all the rules of the book were wrong.6. Mia character wasn't supposed to come out like that. Not sure if the producer/writer read the original manga or they decided to make a different version on purpose7. The love story between Mia and Light felt weird and forced. There is no such story in the original and even though they wanted to make it different, It felt fake and rush. They didn't even know each other and a minute later they get together, just like that. Also how could Light reveal to Mia everything about the book after they knew each other for like 4 or 5 minutes?? Mm...ok7. Why couldn't Mia see Ryuk? I mean she could and she did use the book too8. Why is Mia even using the book with Light?? The book can only be used by one person at a time. I understand that maybe the writer wanted to create a different version from the original story? But if that's the case they should have used a different title instead of Death Note.9. Why did Mia wanted to keep the book from Light if she literally could have used it anyway??10. L was way too different from the original. Why in the world L dressed like a ninja?? It looked like a cosplay from the Naruto anime11. L If I remember correctly, in the original story was someone very introvert, not really sociable and homie. In this movie he was literally preaching in front of a Nation and riding a police car like he was on a Fast & Furious movie. What the??12. Not sure how can Mia be ok that Light kills people?? I mean...alright13. How did Light wrote down the name of Watari in the book even without knowing the fullname of the person? Am I wrong or we don't know what his surname is? So how could Light kill Watari??14. Some music were off, and some scenes looked like ads commercials to me15. Ryuk looked like a monster from an horror movie. Actually he wasn't even in the movie after all. All he did was laughing all the time and doing some creepy appearances. Too bad because in the anime his character was much deeper.There is more but I'm tired of typing. If you have seen the anime and read the manga, then you should not watch this movie because its very bad. If you have not seen the anime or read the manga, I guess you can give it a go. Bear in mind that the movie is different than the original one. So I suppose you might find the original version strange afterward. Anyways I suggest to watch the anime or read the manga instead of watching this movie. The anime is so much better. Not sure what this movie was after watching it. That was not Death Note at all."
ferrule2,Badly underrated,08/10,05-Apr-22,"The premise is complete fantasy but Willem DaFoe's voice alone should get it another point and a half.

NakamuraUbermensch,Death Note: Evolution,03/10,26-Aug-17,"I swear I tried my best, but I just can't understand why someone would make this movie, when there's already a wonderful manga/anime and a great Japanese film of Death Note out there. The only answer that comes to my mind is money, but seriously, you'd have to be a psychopath to do this kind of stuff for money. I must say I am very open minded to changes in adaptations, I think sometimes it might even make it better (The Shining, Arrival, etc), but I can't support Netflix's Death Note, it's not just a bad adaptation, it's a disrespect for the original work. It totally ignores everything that made the manga/anime so great, there are no moral dilemmas, there are no tension, there are no intelligence, and the characters have absolutely no depth, it seems like a generic teen story more than anything else.But I am gonna be fair, we should analyse this movie for what it is, not for what it is in comparison to the original Death Note....and it's incredibly bad the same way. The story is pretty simple, it follows almost the same structure we've seen in the anime before, but as you should expect, it's not that good. And not just because of the lack of tension or rivalry between the protagonists, but because it doesn't really feel real, the characters don't have real reasons to do what they do, and the movie is extremely rushed. Since there's no time for character development, you never care about what happens to them. The acting is guilty too (and consequentially, the director), Nat Wolff doesn't convince as Light at all and Margaret Qualler as Mia must be the most inexpressive actress of cinema since Kristen Stewart in Twilight. Not to mention Lakeith Stanfield as L, what was supposed to be a weird genius, just convinces in the weird part. But fortunately, not everybody does a terrible job, Willem Dafoe does an amazing job as Ryuk, and all the secondary characters are OK, you won't hate them or anything like that. What makes me sad about this movie, is that even the things that were made right, were made wrong. For instance, Ryuk, that as I said, was pretty well voiced, has a horrible look. And it's not because of the low budget, he simply has a ridiculously huge forehead for no reason at all. You can feel that kind of laziness for the entire movie. The original soundtrack, which is pretty cool, seems like the right soundtrack for the wrong film. It has an electronic vibe that would sound very nice in some sci-fi, but obviously doesn't fit here. The directing can be the best thing of the movie and the worst at the same time. It's a fact that Adam Wingard has some skill when it comes to stylization, there are a lot of unusual shots, quick transitions (Very similar to what Edgar Wright does) and some cool gimmicks, like the use of the dutch angle. But the problem lies on the fact that Wingard thinks he's a much better director than he really is. So when you look close enough, you see the pretentious work it is, Wingard does whatever he can to make this movie less generic, sometimes he achieves the goal, sometimes he just makes it awkward. The dutch angle is pretty cool when it's used for the first time, but he uses it so much that it starts to become really annoying. There are some awkward use of slow motion too and awkward use of popular songs in scenes that don't need it, overall, it's an awkward job. I'm not gonna lie, I had fun watching Death Note 2017. Since this is not an 1/10 review, it's valid to mention some good things about this mess. Besides the almost good Ryuk, almost good soundtrack and almost good directing, I think the movie rarely felt boring (Like Ghost in the Shell 2017 did). Although the story is indeed rushed, the pace is works pretty well. The comedy works too, I found myself laughing a lot in the movie, mainly in the first half. I admit it doesn't sound nothing like the Death Note we know, but still, I'm glad they didn't take themselves so seriously. Death Note 2017 is a disgrace to the American cinema, a masterclass in how not to do a film adaptation. If you know nothing about Death Note and got interested in this, watch the anime or read the manga instead, you surely won't be disappointed. Now if you already watched the anime, read the manga and are really really curious about this movie, be warned. It's so terribly, dreadfully, awfully bad, that in the end, you'll wish you had a real Death Note just so you could put your own name on it."
ptk-13352,Entertaining. Too many people upset bc it's different from the anime,07/10,12-Jun-22,"It was entertaining enough. I don't watch anime. Some. My daughter does. I don't care if it's an insult to the original movie. It's not a big budget film. But, watched it while working out, and found it entertaining enough. Fans of the anime, should have known better than to go into this movie thinking it would be on point to the original anime. Went in with high expectations . That's on them.

tanaeher,Loved it,09/10,07-Aug-20,"I watched this knowing nothing about it, having no expectations. Absolutely loved it! I read on here that it's an adaptation of an anime series, and has gotten terrible reviews for not living up to its potential. Well, being that I don't watch anime, none of that mattered. As a movie lover, this was a great movie! I wish they would make it available to purchase because I really want to add it to my collection. My advice is ignore the bad reviews and watch it, because you'll probably love it too.

bragharun-1998,Death Note Only In Name,02/10,26-Aug-17,"This movie is not just untrue to the original series, it spits in the face of the classic anime. Death Note the anime is a tribute to the eternal dispute about justice and the death penalty and who (if anyone) has the right to bring justice to others. The movie completely discards all the valuable source material to create shallow characters that literally no one cares about, when in fact both Light and L have huge fan bases. One of the greatest assets in the series is the mind games between Light and L, something that is not only not shown in the movie -- in the movie we don't even get that Light is a genius!! And don't even get me started on the fact that Light is not Light, character-wise. He's all but Light. Anime Light would never ever do the things that Movie Light does. And who the hell is Mia? The trailer led us to think she would be some sort of replacement for Misa, but she's nothing like Misa, and she's also a poorly written character (we don't know her motives, we don't know anything about her). But the worst of all is that as an anime fan I was hoping that this movie may inspire people who don't watch anime to go watch the original series at least. If I were someone who'd never seen the anime and only watched this movie, I'd never try the anime. The movie is not inspiring, it is nothing but a poorly written cheap thriller. Shameful. PS. 2* just for Willem Defoe's Ryuk. The only one worth his screen time."
dlpolanco05,Wow. The fanboy for the original is outrageous.,08/10,01-Sep-17,"For an adaptation that cuts the source material from 67 (?) episodes at ~20 minutes each, to less than two hours, this was well done. They writers and directors made the source material their own.I'm not sure what fanboys expect. They will never be happy with any adaption unless it comes straight from the original creators mouth. And even then, I bet they'll still complain.This movie is great when you account for all the parts they struggled with (e.g. time limitations, changing a manga/anime to live action, etc.). I want to rate it a 10/10 just to spite the silly rage here on IMDb.It doesn't follow the original source material much at all. It's more a coming of age movie. And it has fun bringing a very dark and fascinating idea to a broad audience.In summary, get over it cry babies. You're killing any chance we have of other adaptations. If you can't handle it, don't watch it. Stick to original Japanese content and leave, us who want more people to get into anime, alone to do the ratings. Sheesh."

petarjovanchevic,They Should've dropped the names,03/10,27-Aug-17,"As a relative fan of the original source material and a sympathizer of the Japanese live-action adaptation, I must say this movie is everything we make fun of online. Americanized Death Note.In all fairness, they should've dropped the names and make it an American Death Note story, no L, no Light, it was just way to distracting.The production is amazing, the characters are interesting, too bad they had they retained the names of the Japanese source. For example, Kira is a calculated megalomaniac, born self-righteous and sociopatic, whereas this ""Light"" was a whiny, angsty little beta, and L shouldn't have lost his composure, etc.Great production, clumsy handling of the source, it's painfully obvious that the writer had very little regard for the Death Note lore and it's a glaring issue that the Suits made the writer shoehorn names from the source, to make it ""Familiar"" or whatever they tried to accomplish."
sean-rae,How in God's name does Adam Wingard keep getting work?,02/10,26-Aug-17,"Let me begin this with i used to see Adam Wingard as a breath of fresh air to a genre in trouble. in a genre polluted with jump scares and zombies, here comes this director and his friends with some new ideas. when i first saw VHS, i was hyped, i followed all the directors who produced a short and this led me on to some real hidden gems in the horror genre. same with VHS 2. so i saw 'A Horrbile Way To Die' the film really got under my skin, twisted with my head and then suddenly in it's final act, lost everything it had going for it, the direction changed, the tone changed, characters even changed. It felt as though the writers had sparked a joint by act three and just went with the 'creative juices'. by this point 'You're Next' had eventually come out after being surrounded by hype from several festivals. I saw it, was more than impressed by the first two acts, and then felt the third act really let the film down, *joint was sparked* ""so do you think we should keep this horror vibe or just go all out comedy and put a blender in someones head?"" - this is how i am more than sure it played out. Same for 'The Guest' great little movie for an hour or so, almost a mysterious action film. that decided it wanted to be a horror in it's final act. 'Blair Witch' (in my opinion the worst sequel/reboot/horror of all time) took the more than simple premise and decided it needed to be pimped, so by act 3, and heads were in clouds, a simple found footage psychological fright fest was turned in to a head spinning supernatural monster movie caught in some sort of time loop? the only these things these movies have in common is the horrible change in tone during the third act, Lines of dialogue that NOBODY would ever say in times of stress and a sure fire 80's synth soundtrack even classic 80's tunes with singing over dialogue. So is Death Note any different? Of course not. If you do not constantly compare to the source material, then it is easier to watch. but if you go in to it with a full on comparison in mind, prepare to have a very rage induced one hour and thirty minutes. Nobody is the same as they are in the source material. When Light is first introduced to Ryuk, his reaction is laughable. his screams are somewhat comical. and Ryuk? almost well done, almost. Just because Wilem sounds good in your head, doesn't mean he will be. after watching this, i no longer believe he would be a fun 'older Joker' or a semi-decent live action Rick (rick and morty), i have lost faith in my own mind. the film tries to be cool in the way someone who grew up in the 80's thinks what kids now think is cool, if that makes sense. stupid slow-mo choices, stupid nods to the Manga that are poorly executed. the ONLY interesting thing about this film is 'L' the detective, nice to see Lakeith Stanfield in a new role, loving his filmography, although even he is hit by the Wingard third act curse, the character 'L' and this whole movie go through a massive change in tone, ears raped by 80's synth and eyes blasted with neon and slow-mo. I will never watch this film again, i only just now learned that Wingard and co are remaking 'I saw the Devil' one of the most brutal and unforgiving Korean movies i have ever seen. i have no faith for this at all. I hope he gets fired soon. Death To Wingard. We Hate You. The People"
kolendacourtney,This movie does not deserve a 4.5,10/10,26-Jul-20,"This movie is really good. In a time where all movies are the same, this movie had twists and turns I did not see coming. LaKeith Stanfield has yet another incredible performance.

M0n0_bogdan,Death Note,04/10,22-May-23,"Ok, I am a huge fan of the anime. Watched it twice. Excellent from any point but especially from a writing point of view. The reason why I haven't seen this movie until now. I know what has been said about this one.The problem with the film is that they tried to make it as a remake when the smart thing would have been to just give the Death Note to someone new. There should have been no Light, no L, no association with the anime or manga. Just use it to make another story. They were really close, too. This Light has nothing to do with the anime Light, neither does L.And Netflix should have made a series. They had the money and the format should have made a relatively cheap production. There is, after all, a lot of talking. But yeah, it is sub-mediocre on all accounts and only put it on because my Videostream was not working haha."
jace-rynearson,This movie is the real crime,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I know I might sound like a stubborn-minded purist when I say this, but I just looked at the cover of this and HATED it. I mean, seriously, they whitewashed all the characters, COMPLETELY messed up the plot, and brought shame to Death Note. The original anime is amazing, I still re-watch it to this day because it's so good. But I was just completely ticked off when I heard they were making a live action movie. We already got one of those, and it was still better than this. Why? 'Cause at least they had the sense to make it take place in japan and give it an original idea. I wanted to puke when I saw Ryuk in a picture for this movie, he was HORRIFYINGLY terrible looking. And the plot didn't have ANYTHING to do with the original show. I have literally NEVER given ANYTHING a 1/10 star, especially one I haven't watched before, and that's saying a ton. They could at least have made this take place in japan and made the actors put on makeup, because I'm sick of what the film industry is doing. It's already perfect, America, stop whitewashing anime shows, come up with your own ideas. I hope this ticks off fans of the show, because that would teach the less-than-intellectual writers to mess with the source material of a great thing. This movie had absolutely no reason to be made, and deserves no attention."
everette-13-151958,Forget the bad reviews.,09/10,18-Mar-22,"This movie is not being judged on its own merit. If you read the other reviews you'll see it's just a bunch of butthurt fanboys that are mad that it's not that same as their manga or anime material. I've seen the anime and Japanese live action versions and they're good. But so is this one. If you're a original material fanboy don't watch it. If you're just someone that enjoys good movies, check it out. It's dark mysterious and fun. And if you like it check out the other versions and source material, they're all good too.

jayboyjay,Not sweet enough for the elite but not a bad apple,07/10,26-Aug-17,"Death note to many sacred and it's easy to see why. Interesting and highly original premise and great art style and characters. So when Netflix acquired the rights and were going to westernize the project many people were a little dubious, ""hey they did great with marvel maybe this will be good"" or ""this will be utter trash, it's a classic, it will never be as good as the anime"". Well guess what your both right! Netflix have done a good job of condensing death note Into 135 mins and while I agree it's not as good as the anime it's actually not a bad film. The leads are good, and L in particular i felt was accurate (as it could be) and genuinely portrayed the character with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. Light was good to OK but the conflict of being Kira, while apparent to see, was dialed back as the confusion and moral soul searching was relatively skimmed over. There is a change in the lore, and I actually found it very refreshing as I didn't want to go into this movie knowing exactly what I was going to get and it's to the credit of the film they actually decided to do their own thing. It's not perfect and sure there are plot holes, however it's gruesome, perplexing and has William dafoe as ryuk, who's clearly having a lot of fun, what's not to love? Don't be put off , just stop with the anime elitism and go into it with an open mind. You might enjoy yourself, and if it's that bad....well....I have a book here and you can write your name in it and forget you ever watched it.....just bring an apple for my friend - J"
jdavisson-61661,Does not honor the source material.,03/10,26-Aug-17,"This review contains spoilers.While not as terrible as the live action dragon ball movie, it is not much better. In an attempt to make the original story appeal to a larger audience this movie eliminates or over simplifies the nuance and relationships that made the anime great.Instead of the the clever game of cat and mouse between Light and L we get a teen love story set in a universe more akin to final destination than death note.  Probably most annoying is the character development of Light, the main character. In the anime Light was an exceedingly intelligent and deliberate character who played the role of an anti-hero, was a narcissist, had no problem with using people as pawns, viewed himself as the ultimate moral authority and would become intoxicated by the power of his death note.In the live action movie Light was none of what made his anime counterpart a compelling character. He was an immature kid trying to impress the girl he likes at school rather than a narcissist. His morality was nuanced with lines he would not cross while his anime alternative saw the world as black and white, anyone against him was enabling evil and thus evil as well. Instead of a man who ultimately destroys himself with a tangled web of lies and subtle mistakes we get a love story that ends with the Light killing his love interest after he finds out she is only interested in his power that she wants for herself."
aaamberik,What a worthless attempt.,01/10,26-Aug-17,"You can't take a series like this and do it one movie. They tried and failed. Now one the most beloved Mange titles has been reduced to crap. It should have just been left alone.What was so wrong with the mange or anime? It did not need retold is such a terrible fashion.It is not the actors or even the directors fault, they should have just well enough alone. If If I had a ""Note"" I wound write their name in it.Don't let who ever idea this was near Macross / aka Robotech. Stop disgracing good stories.

matrixdukenukem000,Haven't seen the Anime? Good,08/10,26-Aug-17,"Here's the thing with movies adapted from another source (books, foreign film, series, anime). Fans are always going to bicker as if the movie was exclusively made for them. I am one of those viewers who reads the books, loves it but keeps movie/series viewing experience running in parallel line. Now this isn't any masterpiece but the low rating you're seeing is definitely not what it deserves. This is a good popcorn flick and if you view it as an independent film adapted from some great anime you're really going to enjoy it. The acting is good, style, vfx, tone of the film and editing is really decent. I've had some problem with the choice of soundtrack but that really depends on one's taste. This is not a spoiler but there are certain choices that were made with the writing that I found was pure dumbness. This movie is 1 hour and 40 minutes long and a good amount of character development was cut down from our lead character and shown to us in a stylized montage. The lead actress's motivation and turning point is never explained. The character of Light's dad is also very unclear. These three major problems in writing are enough to prevent this movie from being in top shelf, thus, unfortunately this will go down as one enjoyable popcorn flick despite the efforts. Willem Dafoe as Ryuk is excellent. I liked LAkieth Stanfield's acting as well. Others do a decent job too. I hope people let go the pompous anime bickering and give it a chance."
PKKING109,Death note review,04/10,14-Sep-18,"*sigh* this movie was pretty horrible. The only reason I didn't give it 1/10 is because of Willem Dafoe as Ryuk.

fearthesacred,Better than it gets credit for,08/10,25-Aug-17,"I know many people will disagree. But, I am a huge fan of the original series and was able to really enjoy this movie by putting that aside. To be very clear, this is not a movie adaptation. This is an original story using the concept/idea of what death note is. Many people are only hating this film based on the fact that it didn't follow the source material. But, an Americanized version of a death note movie would not have worked otherwise. I think we all knew that and went in expecting very little. If you put the original story aside this is an enjoyable experience. Sure there are a few small plot holes and the film feels a bit rushed. But, the same can be said for even the biggest of movies and TV at times. I personally would recommend trying it for yourself. The story is actually very gripping by the end of the film. I also believe a sequel is very much needed to finish what they have started and would love to see it. (So in conclusion please don't just listen to everyone and try the movie for yourself.) As I said I am a huge fan of the original series and have watched it many times over. But, this is something new and exciting and I think they could continue in very interesting ways given an opportunity. The Japanese live action death note movies followed the plot much closer in many ways and they were also complete trash. I think anyone who has seen them will agree. And that just goes to show that some things in anime wont/can't work in a live action setting. I personally feel like it ads a level of realism to the story that was needed for live action. Everything isn't always thought out 10 steps ahead. This feels more real because it's closer to what would happen if someone this age with this mindset was given this power here today. Not always cold calculation but potentially poor decisions made with fear and panic."
basilarmanazi,One of the Biggest Insults to Death Note,02/10,26-Aug-17,"A perfect example of how to destroy one of the best stories and anime I was so excited so see how the Death Note masterpiece was going to turn out on Netflix.They butchered the story They butchered the characters They butchered the dialogue They butchered the suspenseThe only thing they didn't butcher was the apple.This is what happens when you give Hollywood an amazing story with one of a kind characters.

emilybrown02,Missed opportunity,01/10,27-Aug-17,"Like many who have posted before me, I have to say that I have never felt compelled to write a review until now. As a huge fan of the animated series, I admit, I had high expectations for this movie, even though I approached it with the idea that there would undoubtedly and unavoidably be differences. I could have accepted and maybe even enjoyed it if it were even slightly similar to the original version. Even if they changed the story line, I feel they should have at least kept the nature of the characters in line with the original. The characters and their individual personalities are the heart of Death Note. They are the reason why Death Note has the fan base it does. This movie completely butchered that. The characters were almost goofy, creating a totally different vibe for a movie that claims the title of ""Death Note"". If this is what the directors were going for, they certainly accomplished it. I felt like I was watching Zombieland instead of the dark, psychological thriller that is Death Note. The disappointment doesn't stop there. Even for a terribly altered version it was also poorly executed. It had a low budget feel. I mean, I could have sworn I even heard a guy cough into the boom mic around 26 minutes in. I question whether or not these directors have even watched the original series. They couldn't possibly be true fans or they would have never created such a monster. And this could have made an awesome live action adaptation to a hugely successful anime. Instead, it was a sadly missed opportunity."
mjplysaght,"After Dragonball Evolution and The Last Airbender, Hollywood still haven't gotten the message",01/10,05-Sep-17,"Once again, we are presented with a clumsily assembled adaptation of an anime/manga series.Of course, Death Note was a decently made manga and anime series revolving around Light Yagami, a child prodigy who obtains the 'Death Note', is acquainted with the Shinigami Ryuk, attempts to cleanse the world of crime and goes through a god complex, while covering his tracks from the authorities and the world's smartest detective, L.In this uninspired American adaptation, Light 'Turner', is an angsty loner high school kid, who catches the eye of a cheerleader called Mia (a poor representation of Misa Amane, I think?) who receives the Death Note and encounters Ryuk, who I'm pretty sure is never referred to as a Shinigami once during the film. Also, Willem Dafoe goes for broke, hamming it up with his Green Goblin voice as Ryuk.So Light tries to impress Mia with his newfound powers with the Death Note, to which Mia gets turned on by, and what follows is a twisted, by-the-numbers high school love story between the two of them, trying to avoid the authorities and L, who is played by an African-American actor, who in fairness, is doing his best as the eccentric character, but is let down by terrible writing.The pacing is all over the place, but once again, that's down to the fault of adapting an anime series into a feature length film. The movie attempts to throw plot twists into the mix, but they're done so terribly that it just comes across as convoluted and uninspired.I implore you to stay away from this film. Whether you're looking at it with or without knowledge of the original series, it fails on both levels."
a_h-14156,Would Recommend...Just for the Sake of Comparison,01/10,27-Aug-17,"*****SPOILER ALERT*****I've never been compelled to write a review for a movie online before, but I think this has to be done. I usually really enjoy Netflix Originals, but I did not actually enjoy this one in a sense that I was satisfied with the movie, but rather entertained by how terrible it was. Netflix truly did make this an ""original"" since it was practically its own story with a few baseline similarities between itself and the Japanese 2006 movies Death Note and Death Note 2.I'm actually curious about the anime now, since having seen so many complaints of this movie regarding an almost entire lack of correlation. I really enjoyed the Japanese live action movies so maybe I'm not entirely credible to review the Netflix version comparatively - however, I think if you've seen the 2006 versions (which combining both movies totals to about 4.5 hours of run time versus the Netflix version of just short of 1.5 hours) you'd be pretty disappointed in the Netflix version.Here are some key points I found to contribute to the disappointment: 1. Actors 2. Pace 3. Story line 4. Character developmentI'd like to break down the issues with each of the key points:1. I get that this is a western version, so fine, Light and his girl are white and L is black - no problem there. The problem is the acting; I didn't particularly enjoy the dramatic and corny acting of Light and Mia. Everybody else did fine though - including L.2. The pace correlates to the story line. It was absolutely rushed. If you haven't seen the Death Note anime or the movies from 2006 at least, you're going to be so confused as to why anything is anything. The story was not only rushed but the scenes were too. It would go from one scene to the next rapidly. One moment somebody is dying, the next, Light is just chillin' in his room, and then the next he and Mia are making out. I might have that out of order, but the point is, it was so rushed my memory got blurred. It was paced terribly; 1.5 hours is not enough for a story like Death Note. Break it up into two or three movies or something...the first 1 hour alone should be dedicated to the explanation of the Death Note's background and Ryuk.3. The story line is dumb and the pace has a huge role in that. I'm sorry I couldn't come up with a better word for how I feel about it, that's the best. A teen randomly finds a book called the Death Note that fell out of the sky, which the movie doesn't even bother trying to explain the background of where it came from and why, then suddenly meets a demon named Ryuk (whom they also don't really explain the background or reason why he exists besides that he controls the Death Note). This teen then does some "" good deeds"" of killing bad people, then stupidly shares it with a random girl he had met earlier (great plan, dude). Then they both do more ""good deeds"" and kill 400 bad people under the alias Kira, to throw off their location and avoid being caught. Neato. The two fall in love, make out, kill people together, act dramatic, try to avoid getting caught some more...I don't really think I have to break down the entire movie to explain everything wrong with it. 4. The characters don't really develop. One minute the main characters are strangers helping each other out, the next they're madly in love. One minute the dad and Light act like mortal enemies, the next they're totally cool with each other (after Light kills the dude who caused his mom to die or something like that). How do you go from years of resentment to sudden mad love for each other. Anyway, Ryuk's voice was pretty good but his face was a bad rendition. Ryuk seemed to be so evil and only appeared when necessary. Ryuk should've actually had a more active role. Do people know why Ryuk likes apples so much? Why incorporate Ryuk's affinity towards apples if you're not going to explain it at all? He didn't even really have to eat in this version of the movie because Netflix forgot to develop Ryuk as a character. Ryuk is basically just an evil demon who laughs like a maniac whenever people die, and he just wants people to die. Ryuk has a lot more depth to him than this...it's a shame that he wasn't as cool in this movie as he is supposed to be. Anyway, that just about sums it up. I was entertained by the fact that there is a western version of it. I really enjoyed the Japanese live action version so I thought I'd give this a go (even though western versions of Asian masterpieces tend to be terrible...like Dragon Ball). Just as I thought though, entertainment for me on a boring Saturday afternoon...but not worth my while to make a bowl of popcorn for."
feldermoers11,If you never saw the originals then it's good!,08/10,03-May-20,"Sad that the fans of the originals were so disappointed and have completely drowned out anything positive about this movie. It does not deserve the low 4.5 metascore. The concept is great with a compelling storyline and moral quandry... What would you do with the power to kill? Would you use it for good? Can killing ever be good? Willem Dafoe as the demon/death God is awesome and the character L is complex and amazing. There are layers to the movie and a decent twist at the end. If you like horror, fantasy, mystery, suspense, and Willem Dafoe then ignore the myriad one Star reviews complaining how far from the source material this film is and watch.

omendata,Superb film if you aren't an anally retarded Manga fan!,08/10,08-Nov-17,"I read a few reviews before i saw this and the bad reviews seemed to be based on the fact it isn't as good as some manga comic version,As I haven't seen the Manga film; but intend to now i have seen this version, i am basing it on nothing but enjoyment and it was superb from the music to the story it was a real roller coaster ride of fun so I am not prejudging it on anything else but if it was a good film or not. The creature ryuk was very well done and Willem Dafoe was a great choice for the voice. Most of the acting was spot on - even the Scottish guy from Stargate Atlantis.If you haven't seen the original, try it you might be surprised.I am also perplexed as to how you can rate an actual live action movie with a comic book fantasy Manga one - of course you wont be able to make a live action look exactly like a fantasy comic book one - they tried it with Judge Dredd and many others and failed. I am also surprised that anyone can rate a movie like this as a one star - that is just simply ludicrous. Movies like The Bad Batch yes but not this cmon!So go into this with no expectations - you might be surprised at what you might find."
robinsonaustin-07490,Meh.,07/10,25-Aug-17,"So, I had seen the new 2017 take on Death Note that can be found on Netflix. My thoughts? Well....it's not bad. It's not good, but it isn't complete garbage either. I haven't read the manga or watched all of the anime series, so I can't really say how faithful it is to its source. As a movie on its own...it's alright. For one, this film takes place in Seattle, where Light's last name is changed to ""Turner,"" and whatever. It starts off like how you'd expect; a young man discovers a notebook upon which anyone could die if their name was written into it. And Light decides to start a crusade against criminals, using the guise of ""Kira"" to keep his identity hidden.For the most part, the movie was decent. The concept of a Death Note was interesting, but it wasn't really delved on much. For one, you can control someone for a short time as long as you burn the page they're written on; once that is done, they are free to live another day. There are also many more rules behind the Death Note that are really complicated to understand as you're not given much time to digest them, but the idea at the very least is intriguing enough to allow one to continue watching.As for characters. I'll be frank with you all: Nat Wolfe sucked as Light. He lacks any of the charisma and brilliance the original incarnation had, and he comes off as being more idiotic in his planning rather than being ahead of the authorities. In some scenes, Nat's performance seemed to be off...he really came off more as a brat than a mastermind. That's not even getting into how he screams like a little girl when he first met Ryuk. Willem Dafoe does a pretty good job as the apple-loving Shinigami. He's terrifying, yet devilishly comedic with his quips. Margaret Qualley plays Mia Sutton, the film's version of Misa Amane. There is a big twist behind her character, but I'll leave it secretive. Though besides Dafoe, the other actors didn't do that much of a good job. It probably had to do with the script, but I digress. Actually, L's actor was also pretty good, but I could probably say that you wouldn't like any of the characters when this film is over. Really, Light takes on the mantle of Kira because his mother was killed in a hit and run, and yet the film never gives you a reason to care about that.So in short, as a stand-alone film, it's passable. However, if you are a massive fan of the manga, anime, or light novel series, you'd probably want to skip this one as it does chip away anything that remotely resembles its source material."
grega-repnik,It's good!,07/10,28-Aug-17,"And I'm sick to reading all the negative reviews. Feels like children, complaining about their drawings being ruined.Of course it's different than original, what the hell did you aspect?! It has been well over 10years, since the original was released. And Americans have their own style doing things. Anime and Hollywood production are two totally different things to begin with, different goals, different target audience, everything. ""like other anime adaptations, it failed to capture the soul of the original"".. -.- I think it's quite obvious, nobody tried that in the first place.Just think of it as American version of death note. Not adaptation. Just.. American guy came up with the ""killer notebook from death god"" idea. And here it is. So yes, basically all the characters got dumber (except Misa! that would be hard!). Not just because it's American, also cause it does not have 400 minutes to tell you the complex story.So both of our geniuses make some stupid decisions. It's quite funny, how they can be super smart one second and ultra stupid the next. This is the biggest problem I have with the movie, actually.Oh, I have to talk about direction. And pacing. Pacing gets a bit off track from time to time, but no big deal IMO. Direction.. great. I mean, it's no masterpiece, but I really like how it tries to be different. And it is. In a good way. There's not much dialog, but the existing one is necessary. That also gets thumbs-up.So please.. don't act like you didn't know, that American and Japanese cultures are different. Would you make a perfect copy of a painting made by some famous artist? No. You would paint the same scene, but the way you see it, and the way you are capable of representing things.So please.. just watch the movie, and expect nothing more than death note and ryuk visiting America. In that sense.. its a great movie."
Orava89,"The Sane review, not blinded by fanaticism.",08/10,27-Aug-17,"The reviews in here are a joke, first i must say YOU ALL ARE A CRY BABIES, and I'm speaking about those who are given pathetic reviews to this movie. Judging this movie for itself should be the case. I don't want a copy paste always from every thing, this was something new and damn it was good! The fans are ludicrous, judging this movie so awful is an insult to movie reviews in whole. This movie absolutely does not deserves the hate it has given, if fans wants a somewhat copy paste watch the 2006 version and jacket to that.This movie should be judge by its itself, and by so this movie delivers, its not a perfect movie but what movie is, there is not many, that i can say for sure. This was a clever, interesting, light but heavy experience that deserves better score that IMDb has now in it.SHAME ON YOU PEOPLE. I don't write reviews very often but now i had to. Someone that has not been blinded by fanatical fanaticism. I recommend to watch it, and for those who has seen the original material, GO F YOURSELF and watch that instead then this, if your gonna make a joke of reviewing. You child's ruin the real meaning of real movie reviewing. If a poop movie is poop then is poop, but if a movie is good but its not 100% as the original material does not means is poop.In short fans are cancer, movie is good. 8/10 IMDb is a joke, i had to use poop because somehow the other word for poop is to offensive. We truly live in sad world."
enloynz,Too many butthurt fans,10/10,12-Sep-17,"Unfortunately this movie has suffered a low rating like many remakes, reboots, adaptions e.t.c and this is usually due to hardcore fans of the originals being too pretentious, most of whom will already have made their mind up about it before seeing it. However I always try to watch these movies with fresh eyes and not let any feelings I have about the original material cloud my judgement, I prefer to see these movies as ""alternate realities"" because they usually do have changes to the original stories. That allows me to actually watch them without getting all pissy about them. It seems so pointless to review a movie just to say its nothing like the original, go and watch that instead. But not really review the movie, please grow up. Anyway.....I have not seen the original so I was able to watch this movie without any expectations of the source material, unlike most of the people who have rated it so far. I actually liked it, Ryuk looked pretty cool and hes voiced by Willem Dafoe (nuff said). The story wasn't as bad as the haters would have you think, I would say whether you're a fan of the original or new to the world of Death Note you should watch it and see what you think for yourselves, if you are a fan of the original then please try to watch it with an open mind and not compare everything to the original, let's face it, if they made it exactly the same what would be the point?Lastly my rating for this movie is 7, I love Dafoe in this and L is a cool but strange guy too. The reason I've rated it 10 officially is to try and balance out the hatred its already received.I know this ""review"" is hardly a review at all but I just had to say something, definitely worth a watch though."
hungphan91,Doesn't deserve the hate,08/10,09-Jun-19,"This movie is entertaining, thrilling and intriguing. Yes it couldn't compare with the original Death note, however people have to bear in mind the 1 hour and 30 minute screen time that this movie has to work with, compared to the lengthy original series.I personally quite enjoyed this movie. It borrowed the concept and characters from Death note, however the arcs are totally different. It is actually quite refreshing to watch it, it's like watching a different movie, instead of a remake of the original series.

aksteph,Okay if you aren't familiar with the original content. Terrible if you are.,04/10,26-Aug-17,"Just a few things.1. Terrible acting. Especially in the detention scene. 2. Willam Dafoe has the PERFECT Ryuk face...I was so excited when I found out he would be playing Ryuk...why the extra mask, make-up and cgi crap? 3. Light and L in the books were both calm, well thought out people, but this movie made them impulsive and angry people. 4. The ""gore"" was poorly done in each instance.All in all, it was an insult to the books, but for someone who has no idea what it was based from, I can get how you could see it as a ""decent cheesy horror film""

arobinson-27433,Give it a honest chance,07/10,28-Aug-17,"Like many films today, this one had negative feelings before it even was available to be seen. Then those same negative people watched it, griped, and sat arms folded. Give it a honest chance. No, it didn't blow my mind. Did I find it entertaining? Yes. It had a good story and the cast did fine with what they were given. Adam Wingard is one of the best directors in the horror genre today. He did a good job of making it his own with humor and the 80s influenced soundtrack. It was based on anime in another language? I don't give a shirt because anime is lame and you probably are too if you watch it. It would be boring to be 100% faithful to a story in another language. Grow up people. No, it's not Goodfellas. Watch it and enjoy or turn it off and shut the fork up.

dawn10379,An attempt at fairness,05/10,21-May-23,"I'm going to attempt to rate this fairly from two perspectives.From a movie goers perspective, I would probably give this 7 or even 8 stars. The concept is unique and thought provoking. The acting is alright. It's entertaining enough. I feel like it was rushed and should have either been a longer movie or turned into a limited series. I didn't really feel like there was any character development which is a shame because the background story with L would have been especially interesting to learn more about. All in all, it was good but not something I would watch again.Now, from a Death Note anime series fan perspective, I would definitely not give this any more than 2 or 3 stars. Like I said above, the character development was so rich in the original. The movie lacked so many of the qualities that made the original series so good. The whole plot was twisted and rushed. The most exciting plot twists we removed and replaced with scenes that left me with more questions than answers.In the end, I would say if you enjoyed this movie do yourself a favor and go check out the anime!"
filmfan1991,Disrespectful and insulting to the original anime,02/10,02-Oct-17,"Oh boy. Where do I even begin? As a fan of the original Death Note series, this Western adaptation was like food that left a very bad taste in my mouth. In short, this movie was just awful. It was like the filmmakers had never even watched the original show and only paid attention to snippets and tiny details from the show and then mashed it all together in a blender for Western audiences.Most of the acting ranged from bad to decent. Nat Wolff was just awful as Light. He possessed none of the intelligence, cunning or sociopathic nature of the original Light and came across as more of an emo kid with bad hair. Margaret Qualley as Mia was nothing like Misa Amane and felt more like Light from the anime in terms of basic personality. Hell, she might as well had been the main character because she was more sadistic and manipulative than Light. The only things that the film got right were Lakeith Stanfield as L and Willem Dafoe as Ryuk. Lakeith Stanfield was good as L as you can tell that he did do his research on how to portray the character. His mannerisms and ways of behavior were very similar to the original L and while I thought his performance was good, it could have been better because I felt like Stanfield was overacting at times. Ryuk was probably the only thing that the film was faithful to in terms of design and voice acting. Willem Dafoe was an excellent choice as he was able to give off a creepy and otherworldly vibe that the original character had.While L and Ryuk were good, the rest of the film is just bad as a stand-alone film and bad as an adaptation. It cut out way too much of the original story and the whole thing felt rushed because of it. There is just no way that you can adapt a 37 episode anime into a 100 minute movie and expect the story to be coherent. It skimmed over important plot details from the show and it didn't even delve into the moral and ethical questions the original anime presented. Instead it felt more like Final Destination rather than Death Note. Light's and Mia's relationship was just forced and their dialogue was atrocious. Not once in the entire film did I feel the psychological cat and mouse game between Kira and L that made the anime so great. Even the ending is bad since it just suddenly stops and doesn't wrap up in a coherent or satisfying manner.As I said before this movie is just awful and the filmmakers should be ashamed that they even made this (in name only) piece of garbage instead of being faithful to the original series. If you want to look at how not to properly adapt an anime into live action, then this is a great example. Otherwise, just stay away and just watch the original show instead. I really hope that they don't make a sequel and butcher this series even further."
utahman1971,Idiots rating this!,10/10,23-Oct-17,"I do not understand why that you people put this movie down. Sorry, but this is a lot better than Troll movies of horror genre by a million miles. You don't need stupid slapstick comedy in a horror like Troll movies to make them good, which are so terrible to watch.I really hate people that say they are horror fanatics and they just say bad things about horror movies, and then they rate terrible movies higher than the actual better ones, like this one. Thousands of people rated this movie as bad. Stupid if you ask me.Oh well, to each their own. I will just keep enjoying this great movie while you people complain."
sarah-horton-983-175427,I loved it,10/10,30-Aug-17,"If you are looking for this to be identical to the original: Don't watch it.If you are looking for a serious, thought provoking thriller: Don't watch it.If you are looking for a more ridiculous Final Destination-esk live action anime with all the seriousness of animes like ""Rosario + Vampire"" this will be right up your alley. I have a 10 week old baby and wanted to watch something fun and dumb with my husband late at night, and this was great for that. We laughed the whole time and it wasn't gory enough for either of us to have to look away from the screen....it was all around a good time!

sagetwo,Not surprised. It is another Hollywood adaption.,01/10,27-May-19,"It is no different from the other Hollywood's adaptation. The Japanese live action movies, television and musical were way better.The movie lost the essence of the characters, the dynamics and the narrative. It heavily depend on gory scenes to capture the audience's audience. It tried so hard to be like Final Destination. Utimately, the shock value failed.There were no complex mind games. There were no complex characterisations or character developments. The ideals that the characters share are a disappointment. And I can't help but laugh at how things end.Sure, one can see this movie as taking a new approach that is somewhat inspired by the original. Even that be the case, the narrative itself is questionable and the acting is average. For example, Light easily shows the death note to Mia and took no means to avoid being caught.I will not watch the sequel."
samirarizza,It was a good ADAPTATION of a popular Manga,08/10,29-Aug-17,"I like the way that the movie was adapted to be better suited for an American Audience. They subtle changes to certain characters and placement really worked in my opinion. The Mia character seems to have been made into a combination of the Misa character as well as Lights girlfriend in the manga and anime. This is like a whole new story and should be treated as such.The Character development of Light and L through the movie is really good.I didn't like he Ryuuk looked, but that's a personal aesthetics opinion. And the pacing through the movie, in particular a Montage time skip bit was just a mess to me. There was a bit of other scene jumps i found a bit annoying but looking forward to a continuation of this movie series to get the complete story.

CinePendejo,"What a stupid, visually bloated trainwreak",02/10,28-Aug-17,"Let's get this right upfront: I don't think an Americanized version of beloved anime would be a bad idea. Whitewashing, which isn't the same as ""americanizing"", is about as wrong and fairly demonized, but I believe that applying one culture and background to an original material of different countries would be a great idea. Movies like Scarface, The Departed, or even last years brilliant The Handmaiden proved that these grounded stories could expand in many areas.In that case, an American Death Note would sound very ripe with opportunities. Acting as both a questioning on the meaning of justice over malice and a commentary on the Japanese paralegal system, the show gained wide acclaim for being both sadistic, smart, and genuinely one of it's kind. Given the wide amount of opportunities this could bring in our culture and legal system, I wasn't really against this new Netflix Death Note before it's release.What I am against, though, is the final film sucking as hard as this.A completely stupid, laughably over directed missed opportunity, Death Note is pretty much a slap to my face for ever letting my guard down like this. The type of bad movie that makes you annoyed during it, but makes you sad when it's over. Every pre-production news warned me about the upcoming disaster I was about to witness, and the waste of my 100 minutes now counts as punishment.Committing it's first mistake, it stars bratty loser Nat Wolff as Light Turner who has an thirst for purging the world because of a tragic family death and he's a nerd who gets bullied at school. This walking cliché of a character then gets a Death Note, a magical book that kills people with random occurrences once their name is written down. He then meets an ugly CGI Ryuk (Willem DaFoe, barely making even 5 minutes here) who originally owns the death note.As he kills notorious criminals with implausible yet admittedly cool Rube Goldberg setups, he is then called Kira by an unexplained cult that worships his presence but only show up on screen for when the plot needs them to. Light is then tracked by an unknown Sherlock Holmes character named L (Keith Stanfield, with this and WAR MACHINE being proof he's capable of being good in bad Netflix movies) who somehow tracks down who the real Kira so fast you'd be surprised it wasn't even an hour in. Oh yeah, and there's this obnoxious girl who was supposedly Misa from the original anime, but only as a bland sidekick to Light who doesn't prove any threat to his secret until a pointless midway twist.The whole thing makes no sense. The characters are complete opposites to their original selves, the plot is rushed and clunky, every action is completely illogical and only serve to keep this whole burning trainwreak moving, and the supposed commentary on what justice is or who is the real immoral center is thrown away for lousy Hollywood action chops. At first Ryuk is set up as this main threat to these characters, but then barely does anything in the slightest. The subplot with finding L's real name never went anywhere, and even the thematic threat with Mia and Light falls flat on it's face. It's like a speeding racecar gradually loosing all its hardware as it moves to the finish line.And then there's Adam Wingards direction. I'm still a firm believer that he makes legit great work with YOU'RE NEXT and THE GUEST, but not even he could make this good. Knowing full well he has a wretched script on his hands, he tries wholeheartedly to cover it up with his usual hyper stylized aesthetic with embarrassing results. Constant camera tilts, speed-ramping, overly used color lighting, highly dramatic killings, an over-the-top foot chase, and a Ferris Wheel sequence that completely throws the movie off the rails. It's visual overkill, as if Wingard is covering up a mound of turd with as much ice cream topping as possible to make it look great.Death Note is stupid and overly stylized where the anime was intelligent and grounded. If there was any sort of example on how NOT to do an adaptation, this takes the cake.Read here for more reviews : https://letterboxd.com/Itachisan125/"
edwardmcaleister,Just...terrible,02/10,27-Aug-17,"OK, so we all knew this wasn't going to be a make over from the original plot. A lot of key elements have changed and many things essential to the series are gone. You don't get to see L and Light playing their mind games towards each other. Which is what kept the series going and was the most interesting thing about Death Note. The movie follows only one thing from the original story and that is - Book falls onto Light's hands - Ryuk appears - Named written on the book are going to die and that's pretty much it. The rest of the plot? Straight to the toilet, along with whatever good it had to offer. The acting wasn't THAT bad but the story really was. The confrontation scene was somewhere around the middle of the movie and there was no mind games whatsoever. If anything the whole thing went like this - I know you're Kira - OH YEAH? AND WHATCHA GONNA DO NOW BOUT IT? and so on.This is a terrible waste of time for anyone who wants to remember the old series and movies."
Merwholock,Disgrace,02/10,27-Aug-17,"This is a total disgrace of the original manga and anime. They totally destroyed the world of Death Note and of course the characters! This is definitely not Yagami Light , the bright student , the mastermind that could think 5 steps ahead of everyone else that his only real adversary was the greatest detective of all time L , which lead us to another huge disappointment; the non-relevant at all personality of L. The 99% of the movie was just a complete fiasco,we could see it from the beginning...they would ruin it. I fought with myself to watch the whole of it.. I wanted to stop so many times but I managed to do it.. well , I kinda regret it. From now on, I won't accept the existence of this...it just never happened.

darknessbladers,The only good thing of this movie was the CG of RYUK,02/10,05-Nov-21,"Aside from RYUK's CG this entire movie was nothing more than a piece of garbageL was a emotional wreck, getting angry at even the slightest provocation
L was a emotionless person in the original, only shedding a tear when Watari died.Light, revealed himself too easily to his friends. In the original he was a cold an calculative person.As for the rest of the characters each important one from the original was killed off instantly. Making any sequel impossible. As none of the original characters are even alive to progress the story."
WatchesHumans,Just fine,08/10,25-Aug-17,"I saw the anime several years ago and it was just fine. I vaguely remember interesting characters an intriguing plot and some good cat and mouse. All of those are maintained to some degree (you can only do so much in less than two hours), the cinematography is very good, the casting is excellent, and it felt like watching an anime, which is commendable. Apparently all the more forgettable details from the original anime were changed, but it doesn't really matter given that they weren't all that important to understanding the story in the first place, and anyway why would you even want a carbon copy of the anime, the creative license served a good purpose here, and I my guess is that most of the reviews here are based on some subjective notion that there was something exceptionally remarkable about the original which apparently failed to strike me in ways that some other animes do, but so be it. I enjoyed almost every moment of this movie, it didn't blow me away but it was a good flick, kept my attention, wasn't too banal, was cast very well, was well produced, well-written and well-acted. 1 star reviews for this movie are ridiculous."
toth-ricsi90,It's a shame to the original masterpiece.,01/10,22-May-22,"Awful adaptation. HORRIBLE MOVIE. I honestly wish this movie could be unreleased and deleted from the internet like it never happened because then this world would be a better place.

puneetgoyal728,a brilliant concept ruined,01/10,25-Aug-17,"You had exceptional concept and immaculate story line to work with. How did you manage to ruin it so well? The 2 hour time limitation is no excuse for doing what you did to my favorite Anime. The Light ""turner""'s character is weak. The story line is pathetic. There is almost no thrill. The Shinigami starts interfering in the investigation without explanation. Character 'L' does impress few times but leaves lot of loose ends. Utterly disappointed with the outcome. Guess Netflix should just go back to making TV series."
arungeorge13,Origin story felt too rushed! [+42%],04/10,31-Aug-17,"The writers of ""Immortals"" join hands with ""You're Next"", ""The Guest"" and ""Blair Witch"" sequel director Adam Wingard to cook up a more Americanized version of the popular Japanese manga - Death Note. Not an ardent follower of the original series (although I've seen a few episodes), I still felt like this Netflix adaptation could've been a lot better had it chosen to stick to its excellent source material. Wingard probably tried to leave his own signature when he took up this project as it feels more inclined to some of his earlier films than the Ohba-Ohbata creation. While the series positioned itself in a psychological/fantasy thriller territory, this version adopts a more gore-horror approach fused with an undercurrent of dark humour. It is also because the originals are considered ""cult-classic"" material that this film feels heavily clunky. The names of the lead characters have been borrowed from the series but there's clear evidence of the writing department doing their own bit of tweaking when it comes to their behavior and motives. When Light Turner gets a book that lets him rid the world of anyone he knows by name and face, he (and later his romantic interest) decide to take matters into their own hands by killing off a bunch of baddies (400+ in number, as some of them keep reinstating), making the world a better place to live in. When things happen at such a rapid pace not allowing the viewer to assimilate, it doesn't add a great deal to the overall experience. While the film enjoys bragging about its universality and international connections, at the end of the day, the core turns out to be about personal angst and jealousy between two individuals who happened to have fallen for each other. There's some atrocious dialogue as well, supplementing said claim. When the discernible link between morality and mortality begin to show signs of dwindling, the story itself plunges into plain boredom, leaving the viewer uninterested in the fate of the lead characters and the supposed twists in store. The film focuses very little on the actual dilemma faced by Light (said to be a loner nerd) in choosing his victims, instead places higher emphasis on a romance that more or less looks like 'taking advantage of each other'.It also doesn't help when there's plenty of unresolved mystery with respect to some of the main characters. Like Mia, for instance. The rationale behind some of her decisions looks phony as hell, and feels more like plot-convenience to make Light look like a stronger character in comparison. L, the independent investigator's back- story is also not fully explored into. Maybe a sequel will tell. Coming to the technical side, the VFX at times looks pretty B- movieish (on the lines of Final Destination) while music and cinematography do not really accentuate the ordeal. Wingard's eye for uncanny imagery and Willem Dafoe's voice for Ryuk are in fact the film's strong-points. Verdict: Not sure about this one leaving an impression on either fans or non-fans!"

lisbell121495,Anime Fanboys are taking this too heart.,09/10,10-Sep-17,"It was a very decent live action film to get a new audience involved with creative concepts coming from our Japanese family. Netflix is at least trying to do something cool and that region is cranking out more original source material than us in the west. I too would like to see west movie companies stay truer to the source, however in order to get to that ideal spot we have to chill out and get behind what I viewed as a pretty good and tight script that in this viewers observation stayed as close to the tale of Death Note as possible given the restraints of a one time film. Yes please continue to honor the original but keep an open mind on Anime to live action, it will develop eventually to that desired honesty you Anime Fans desire so much. On the bright side keep up your criticisms it at least lets them know to keep trying so they can get it right and eventually quell these bombastic opinions that this reader feels are overblown.

manuelasaez,"Way better than I anticipated. A pleasant surprise, as far as Western adaptations of Japanese properties are concerned.",07/10,27-Aug-17,"First, let me start out by saying I am a pretty decent Death Note fan. I followed the manga as they were released, and I LOVED the anime and films released in Japan. They are, without a doubt, the best Manga-to-Film adaptations ever made. I heard about Netflix doing a remake, and I thought, Oh great. Another Western company setting out to ruin what is great about a Manga. Color me shocked when I watched this film and I wasn't completely repulsed, but actually entertained throughout the entire run time.Look, the movie was never going to live up the expectations of the Manga or the Anime, and it certainly wasn't going to be better than even the worst of the 3 Japanese films. But this movie did one thing right, and that was be considerate of the source material. The story, characters and scenarios were all familiar, but adapted for a Western audience, and I honestly do not think they could have done a better job. Everything was thoughtfully done, the script was serviceable, and while I disliked some of the casting choices, the cast was talented and really worked with the material given.The gore effects and the CG were also surprisingly well done, and blended almost seamlessly with the real action. It was actually quite impressive seeing Ryuk emote, and the Ferris wheel looked real enough to touch. Overall, don't go into this movie expecting a transcendent experience. Don't come into it comparing it with the Japanese version, as it was never going to measure up. Think of it as a re-imagining of the story from a Western perspective, and you might just find something entertaining, much like I did. Don't read reviews from people comparing it to the Japanese versions; it just doesn't really do this film any favors.That being said, the two leads were INSUFFERABLE. Light Turner was annoying, awkward and stiff, and don't even get me started on the colossal joke was the actor who played L. He overacted certain scenes, fumbled others, and mumbled his way throughout the entire movie. The diversity cast did not lend anything of value to the movie, and it would have been better if they would have cast a Japanese guy. Also, Mia, the lead girl, is a talented actress, but was the main love interest, she left a lot to be desired. Aside from these 3, the cast was incredibly diverse and talented, and it really brought a nice sense of immersion to the film."
kieranoswt,Its... pretty good,07/10,29-Aug-17,"So we all know how rarely we get a good anime adaptation, hell even an okay one. this one was somewhere between acceptable and I would buying it on DVD. its main problem is pacing in the first 40 minutes we have light with the notebook and his girlfriend, who knows hes kira, and L already with some idea of who he is. this took the anime 10, 20 minute episodes for just over 3 hours and the manga 30 chapters, in other words its main issue is pacing, its a drama shot to be like an action film.So plot time, Light finds a notebook kills some people gets a girlfriend kills more people l comes along some more people die then l searches lights house and finds nothing so lights okay and goes to dance and he evades some cops plans for his inevitable coma goes on ride falls of ride gf dies his page gets burnt so he lives but he comes out his coma to find the book has been returned, l kills him and the cycle continues.overall its pretty good at least a 8/10"
realtanwin,Horrible... No respect to the source material...,01/10,27-Dec-17,"I have no words... Just burn this movie and burry its ashes. Next time, we'll give you an asian Captain America, a black Joker, screw up the whole story and we'll see how the comic book fans will react. That's what they did to the manga and Death Note fans.

connor-babcock93,Entertaining Movie,09/10,13-Jun-20,"Seeing as how I'm not at all familiar with the original source material, I was able to enjoy this as just a movie and not as an adaptation. If you are not familiar with the original story, then this is an entertaining movie to see. To be completely honest, though, the only reason I watched it was because Willem Dafoe was in it.

DanCohen12,Whose name would you write down,01/10,25-Aug-17,"Probably the producers name.In a film that tries to cram 10 liters of story into eight ounces of time, it's extremely frustrating to see so much of it wasted on gratuitous kills that can't even stack up to the creative bloodlust of the trashy B-movies they rip off. the movie is a very condensed take on the manga with two unsatisfying lead performances...

LongLiveTheNewFlesh27,An outsider's perspective...,02/10,29-Aug-17,"I came into Death Note with an open mind. I had never seen the anime (although I plan to because it looks great) and I had liked some of Adam Wingard's stuff before, namely The Guest. And after sitting through Death Note's 1 hour and 40 minute runtime...I can only imagine how the fans of the anime feel. If I had to describe this movie in three words it would be: messy, misguided, awkward. I'd say the first twenty to thirty minutes are the most solid of the entire movie, except that you'll see enough high school clichés to think that you're watching some YA nonsense and not a gory thriller about a sociopathic teenager with a book that can kill people. But it's not too bad, yet. Willem Dafoe brings a typically great performance, there's some intriguing ideas, an excellent gory kill... But then, after those solid twenty or so minutes, the movie collapses in on itself. What could have been a dark and investing thriller about a kid who has the power to do basically anything he wants turns into into an absurd clusterf***k of a film that's tonally literally all over the place. Is it a gory thriller? Is it a dark drama about what's morally right and wrong? Is it a absurd comedy? Is it a teen romance? All of this, and the saddest thing is that it's just wasted potential. It could have been a classic, but instead will probably end up a cautionary tale about what not to do when you're adapting something beloved. It's not ALL bad: the cinematography is interesting, it's never boring per say (but never really entertaining in the way they want it to be), Willem Dafoe, of course. But it is a LOT of bad."
da_mirko,I feel myself pretty well entertained...,09/10,02-Sep-17,"First let me say: i understand everyone who knows the Original and feels not satisfied with this one. That said, i know this was a punch in the face...and i like Mangas/Animes as well. I can count up a lot of very bad adaptations (Fist of the North Star, for example...), but i kinda liked this one. Maybe it's because i'm not so familiar with the original Anime Series or other adaptations, but i know, what's going on. And for that, i think it did a good job. See it as a Popcorn-Movie only for entertaining purpose. Don't expect some character-studies or other descent developments...it's just for fun. I think, it's very hard to put a complex Story like DEATH NOTE in 1h41m...and i can hear all critics shouting ""So don't do it!"". But i think it worked very well. I liked the characters and the soundtrack was good, too.So: hardcore Fans, avoid this one. Maybe it would've worked better, as a Mini-Series or a regular TV-Show.To all the others: it's worth a watch and i hope they'll make a sequel. I've seen worse this year, but this one's good. Check it!"
paigebrumby,A great movie with a fresh take on the original story,09/10,25-Aug-17,"As someone who already watched most of the anime, I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If you are going into this expecting an exact adaptation of the anime, you'll probably not get what you want out of it, because that isn't what this film is. For me, if I were to compare it to the anime (I personally think they should be enjoyed separately due to them being different stories), I would say that I enjoyed this more than the anime, especially the ending, which I will not spoil.This film takes the basic story of ""High School student finds a notebook and uses it to kill bad people"" and makes it something different. The characters are all different, and they aren't meant to be treated like they are the same as the anime characters, because they aren't. So I guess my point here is that you should go into this movie with an open mind, don't expect it to be anything like the original anime, and you will find it as enjoyable as I did."

thesar-2,The Butterfly's Final Destination,07/10,01-Oct-17,"When the premise is presented within minutes of the opening, those famous words are thought: ""This cannot end well.""Okay, that and ""Be careful of what you wish for.""I'm probably being biased here, but this recommendation from both by a horror movie podcast and Netflix, itself, is set in my favorite city, Seattle and ""borrows"" from two of my favorite horror movies: Final Destination and The Butterfly Effect. Admittedly, I had forgotten about the synopsis, but recalled the name. Glad, for those two reasons alone I clicked on it.Basically, the title book literally drops in our ""protagonist's"" lap at his high school and he's greeted by the fantastic William Dafoe all-but reprising his Green Goblin role in the shape of a snarky and spikey demon. While there are many rules attached and in said book, the gist is, the new owner of the book must think of a person's face, write their name on a page within while also stating how they should realistically die and bam!, wish granted.There's gotta be a catch, right? No movie without one, right? So, yeah, things get muddy. Especially when the film's second awesome character, ""L"" jumps on tables to investigate the Death Note's victims.I had fun. Aside from Dafoe's wildly fun demon and L's parkour, our main characters were engaging enough, dialogue good, wonderful cinematography and while confusing at times with many back-and-forth motivations and actions, it kept me to the end.Now, definitely not perfect. As stated, it could've used one to two more rewrites and it's not the longest movie at 100 minutes, but you felt most of those minutes. At about an hour into it, it sure felt like it was wrapping up, but there were 40 minutes leftand you will feel that way until the end.Also, why did they move the location of Seattle's Great Wheel? Eh, that's one of my pet peeves for places I frequent and love. Like Vegas. For no rhythm or reason, many filmmakers move massive landmarks on the Strip without thought of the billions who have seen the places live. Here, they seemed to make a whole new pier to host the Ferris Wheel with some carnival exhibits to join it. While the wheel is real, the location in one of the many climaxes is complete fiction.I digress. I enjoyed it. You might, too, if you love the Final Destination franchise, the first Butterfly Effect and Dafoe's take on the Green Goblin.***Final thoughts: (Spoiler Alert) I just recently got back from Seattle and I had ridden said Great Wheel for the first time. Scared me to death! I hadn't realized the cabins shake back and forth and I knew the history of the Wheel – they take it down for half the year due to being on a pier during the windy season. So, I knew this was not a permanent fixture. With that knowledge, and no spoilers (especially to you, Keymo! ~ my companion on the ride) I'm just glad I watched this afterward I returned home."
sea_angel-75127,Not bad at all actually,07/10,25-Aug-17,"The film takes inspiration from the original material while still providing a different and fun story to watch. The plot itself is completely different and very interesting (to its own merit) with various touches from the anime/manga here and there.SPOILERS!!!!!!!The characters are completely different in the most brilliant way: Light is not the original Light from the manga, and neither is Misa/Mia (they are actually somewhat inverted). If you are a fan of the original you will notice straight away that some characters incorporate several others from the manga. I personally liked that very much as it kept the story interesting and ""unpredictable"".Overall, the film is very nice for a Friday night. It is entraining and fresh, while still giving you nice ""sprinkles"" of nostalgia. Do not expect a summary of 40 anime episodes into a live-action 1h30 film, this film has the taste of ""Death Note"" (and its title) but its a completely different creation.I recommend it!PS: watch through the initial credits, its worth it!!"
j_walking1516,Not just an insult to the source but an insult to the audience,01/10,20-Dec-19,"This ""movie"" is just plain garbage. Even if you ignore that they completely destroyed the source material. Not just ignored but insulted it at every turn. It's just constantly infuriating how little respect they had for anyone who had supported the franchise.
That aside, it's poorly made. The writing is shallow, cringey, and honestly stupid. It plays like a script written by an angry 7th grader who is mad at mommy and daddy. None of the characters are developed in any way. There's zero growth or explanation of any persons. It's just flat and soulless. I got second hand cringe every scene
The framing and cinema are boring and amateur. The actors are mediocre, best for TV movies.
Just nothing about this garbage is acceptable

deezsoup,Misinterpreted yet still far underwhelms it's Anime counterpart.,03/10,26-Aug-17,"I give the movie a 3⭐️ because it turned and mushed up one of my favorite anime (yes I know it has flaws) into a nonsensical, rushed and mostly disappointing movie adaptation. The reason why I didn't give this show 1⭐️ simply because the actors did a good job acting out their characters however these characters were far from the original and seem like they could have been their own thing rather than a varied version of the originals. If they had done this by changing Light and L into their own completely different personalities then maybe the plot may have made sense and would not have been like a sh1tty remake that uses the source material as a means to make people click on the show to watch it. With all I have said if you have watched the anime or read the manga prepare to be disappointed and/or angry but if you didn't just don't watch it. It's not worth the 1hr and 40mins."
tessburnside,Outstanding!,10/10,27-Aug-17,"This suspense/thriller had me on the edge of my chair. It was heart-pounding action from start to finish. I do not normally watch these types of films, but I was intrigued with the previews sufficiently to want to see this for myself.The plot was clean, the scenes well choreographed and the action was non-stop.Due to the graphic nature of this film, this is obviously not for kids. But if you like a good, scary story, this film is for you."

jdcook-02768,Pretty good for a film adaptation,08/10,30-Aug-17,"Now when you watch this Movie you must understand it's an US movie adaptation. It's decently good going into it with that mindset. Personally the Death Note anime is my favorite TV show and the movie does an alright job making it a movie. Of course they can't make a movie of the entire series in 2 hours. The cinematography is brilliant! As well as the soundtrack! The story is pretty fast compared to other movies but considering is based of of a TV series it does an alright job. All together I'd suggest it to anyone with an appreciation of mystery/sci-fi movies.

ramosaral,Abomination,01/10,12-Sep-17,"It is really difficult to turn the masterpiece that is Death Note into this unimaginative, unsuccessful, cheap, and the thousands of pejoratives I cannot write down here. I will not go into details but they somehow managed to wreck every single beautiful thing about the original. This should be taught at movie departments under the title ""How not to make a film."" What were the Netflix guys thinking?

sophb3,Watch the original anime series!!,01/10,30-Aug-17,"Just god awful.I went in with very low expectations as the original anime was phenomenal and there was no topping it. They changed the story line completely to bring it to modern day America which wasn't necessary. Made him fall in love and be okay with telling people about the notebook when in the series he couldn't be more secretive if he tried. They left out so much of the story line, made the character L into this crazed, unpredictable character. All of it was just awful. If they do another one I'd be shocked. More shocked at who would want to waste an investment in it. For anyone who has just watched this film in hopes to make them want to watch the original anime series, please don't let this discourage you."
MikeHunt1075,Not that bad.,06/10,03-Feb-18,"First thing you have to know here about this film is its based on some existing animie/manga, or whatever they call that stuff in Japan. So every review you see here giving the film a low rating is some ""boo-hoo, the American adaption has the toilet paper to the inside of the wall and not the outside like we're used to.""Well, who cares? Certainly not someone like me who has never seen, let alone heard of the original foreign version. If id have looked at reviews here first, id most likely think it was a horrible movie not worth seeing.Get over it original series fans... it didn't work trying to adapt whatever your precious original contained, and it was changed so the American culture or western world could understand it. It's not like they made this the 2017 version of Ghostbusters.Take it for what it is, and shut up about what it's not. It's a decent enough film on its own.... well, apart from the raised to be a super-dedective guy who has to sit on a chair like he's trying to have a bowel movement... and is confused as to how to keep his face covered.... I take it that carries over from the stupid anime thing and looked just as stupid as Nicholas Cage in CGI pointing saying ""Guilty"" in Ghostrider. That stupid stuff should have been cut, plus made the detective older and more believable... thats about it, tho... the rest was fine.Please keep in mind, loyal cult followers reading this fuming that I probably insulted their reason for living, but I don't care and really don't care about the original stories.... this is a review by an outsider, for the outsiders. I'm just giving a much fairer review than an alternative version that came before it that wouldn't work for western world audiences."
girlmeetschaos,Don't expect the anime... Or the manga,05/10,03-Sep-17,"Okay so the first thing I do when I watch adaptations like this is attempt to not compare it to the original too much. Obvivously this is an awful adaptation of Death note. To me, though, it felt more like an alternative story or a parody of the series. In the anime/Manga, Light is slightly cool, has a girlfriend, gets good grades... In this version Light is incredibly cringy and awkward and I kind of liked that.I liked that it wasn't glorified obsessiveness it was pure awkward teen trying to do good through bad. I feel like this is a more realistic take on what would happen if a teenager got the death note. All in all, it was entertaining to watch and compare but if you watch it expecting anything similar to the original you'll definitely be disappointed."
capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,06/10,13-Sep-17,"Death NoteIf humans could instantly kill anyone they wanted then rush hour would be a mortuary.Thankfully, only one person in this horror movie can control the fate of others.Light (Nat Wolff) is a wimpy teenager who discovers a magical book that will kill whoever's name is written in it and will use whatever method is detailed by the author.This omnipotent power not only attracts his crush (Margaret Qualley) – who wants to help Light wipe out criminals around the world as the antihero Kira – but also the book's demonic owner, the God of Death (Willem Dafoe).Adapted from the popular Japanese manga, this whitewashed version only hangs its poor interpretation on the bones of the original. Ignoring the source material, the story still feels abridged. But at least the graphic death scenes aren't muted.Incidentally, things could get really ugly if an illiterate were to ever own this book. Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
guillem-415-919192,Not bad,04/10,25-Aug-17,"Not bad is the best I can say. I did like the actors, they're good, they would have nailed it if this had been a series written according to the original story.Regarding this movie... if only they hadn't invented a completely different plot! It's oversimplified, the shinigamis and their world and the Death Note itself aren't developed AT ALL, the detective story is about 5% as complex as the original one and for such a short movie (that was what, 100 minutes?) they replaced most of the clever parts with gore and chases.

jtindahouse,A missed opportunity,05/10,29-Aug-17,"So it seems we found out who the most important member of the Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett duo is. For a while now the two have been teaming up to make some of the best movies being released today. They have brought originality, inventiveness and high-class to each film they've endeavoured to make. However 'Death Note' has split the duo up, leaving us only with director Wingard, and the results are not quite as seamless.Interestingly, the problems with 'Death Note' actually do indeed lie in the script. The concept is a fascinating one and should be able to make for a great film, however the actual product is quite bland and boring. It spends too much time on the weakest parts of its story and not enough on the strongest parts. The book itself is interesting and leads to endless possibilities, so all the time spent with the character of 'L' trying to track the culprit feel wasted and are frustrating. They had to be there, but they didn't have to feel like the dominant part of the film.I didn't love Nat Wolff in the lead role. His acting is often clunky and distracting. The rest of the cast were quite strong though. There are some entertaining elements to the story and the pacing is good enough to keep you interested. I feel like this could have been better though and there is a lot of story left to be told in sequels that eventuate."
bradleymweighill,Am i the only person who enjoyed this film ??,07/10,21-Jun-20,"Let me start off by saying this is my very first review for a film. I haven't seen the original anime series because japanese shows like that don't interest me at all. But I loved this film , it was funny , gory and yes sometimes cheesy. The look and voice of RYUK was awesome and was the best bit of the movie for me. Yes okay the whole emo main character who's bullied and the hot dumb cheerleader characters are cliche and played out at this point. But the acting was good and I didn't have a problem with the casting. Stop listening to all these bad reviews. At the end of the day films and anime series are completely different things. If you like horror thriller high school films you'll love this film.

taborfreddy,"Fun watch, not much closure",08/10,29-Oct-20,"Despite it's departure from the original, I thought it was fun to watch. So far I have watched this film twice and enjoyed it. I liked that William Dafoe plays the death note's monster - he gave the monster an approachable but malicious personality. I didn't give it a ten because I have yet to figure the ending...i feel like I was left hanging at the end.

bendusz,Why call it death note? It barely has any similarities to the source material,01/10,22-Feb-22,"No words needed, we all know it's bad.Anyone who is a fan of the Anime knows that these characters don't even resemble their anime counter parts.Light is a very talented honor student, son of a police chief, bored out of his mind because he is so smart that life is too predictable and basically a sociopath with a god complex.L is a special breed of detectives, also hecka smart, willing to do anything to bring Kira to justice.The whole story is based around these character's cat-and-mouse game as they are trying to outsmart each other in various ways. Both of them trying to force their twisted way of justice on the world.Movie Light is a horny teenager who shows no signs of intelligence and tries to get laid with his weapon of mass destruction.Movie L is emotional, reckless and just an insult to the original in terms of intelligence.Overall, if they advertised the movie as a take on the Death Note universe and didn't touch the original characters and made new ones, it wouldn't have been such a piece of garbage.One plus side to this whole poop show is Dafoe as Ryuk. He would have made an awesome Ryuk in a GOOD MOVIE."
pimpninjaz-75367,"A poor adaptation, but a wonderful re-imagining.",10/10,27-Aug-17,"The film is NOT an adaptation of the original Death Note. Although it follows some of the same beats and some characters have the same names, it is not an adaptation. This film is a re-imagining of the Death Note series in a new setting. Not only that, but it's a pretty good one. The acting is fine, the camera-work is great, Willem Dafoe is amazing, the story is legitimately interesting, and the characters are legitimately likable. The only major problem with the film is that every 30 minutes or so, we have to sit through 5 minutes of insanely fast-paced scenes that feel almost like a montage. These period pace- breaking moments are a huge problem for the film, and that's something that should have been handled by the editing team.The reason most of the people reviewing this are mad about it is because it didn't perfectly adapt the original. As a fan of the original, I don't mind. There was no way they could have adapted a 7+ hour anime into a reasonably long film without cutting massive corners and butchering the story. Even if they did somehow find a way to make it exactly like the original, we would just be watching the same story again. Telling the same story over and over would just show a painful lack of creativity. The filmmakers realized all this. They realized they couldn't tell the original story the right way, so they didn't even try. They made up a new story and new characters, and then let the concept of the ""Death Note"" loose into this new setting. I think it worked very well.Note: I do not actually think this is a 10/10 film. It's not The Godfather Part II. I think it's a solid 7/10 to a light 8/10, but I had to up the rating to counteract all the unjust negativity this film is getting. I only hope these anime fans can look past their bias and view the film for what it is, instead of looking at it for what it's not.Take it easy, and lots of love."

sceet,It isn't that bad.,07/10,03-Sep-17,"First off, fanboy hate for only watching the first 5 minutes, I understand. By far the worst part of this movie is the first 40 minutes. The next hour however is really well done. Take it as an American adaption instead of a literal adaption and you might get over that hate. The pacing is indeed way too fast the first half of the movie, them trying to make a set up of what takes 10 episodes, into 30 minutes is a big problem. I agree the set up should have taken more time. ALSO MIA IS NOT MISA! If you read the interviews she was meant to be the crazy side of Light. She isn't even remotely Misa in anyway. Mia and Light were supposed to be Light. Mia was the God Complex Light had in the first few episodes before it slowly took him over. This way when Mia died, the true Light was then combined as you could see from the ending. That last 20 minutes was so good! If Light was more like that in the beginning I would be able to watch it probably multiple times in the week. L does a good job with the script and his performance is well done, the character of L is much different in this one because he has to be more aggressive since the Police in the USA instantly start fawning over Kira while the Police in Japan have many meetings trying to decide what they should do and L can then utilize them to do his several plans. It is just a matter of America tries to act fast and more emotion based. Japan's is more fact and logic based. That is also a big part of the theme. Light in the Anime realizes that after so much study of law and detective skills, that Law and government loses a lot of the people that deserve to be punished and takes it upon himself. Something again is more Japan based.Americanized Light is taking it more as if the Police don't do anything and more often than not hurt what he sees as Justice instead of helps it. More based on the current view of the Police here in America. Have you seen how much hate there is for police because they aren't truly standing up for the Law? That is Light here. This is a well done adaption taking the themes more for American Audiences. I do realize the anime is much better and I will rewatch it many more times than I will rewatch the movie. That doesn't mean the movie is awful. It just is different. I do agree I wish there was more of a cat and mouse game by the mind like the anime does, but it won't help to just say it is crap with absolute crap criticism. It looked like this movie was rushed based on a few of the scenes having no thought out edits. If you pay attention you can see a few camera issues, but overall the cinematography is amazing. The shots are well done and the special effects are exemplary. If you want to watch the movie only looking at the bad, you'll find it, but there is a lot of good in it too you can find. A few concepts I enjoyed and in some ways wished it was a bit more fleshed out. Ryuk being more of a villain character was actually surprising but I enjoyed it as a whole. When Adam Wingard pitched this movie to Netflix, he originally did it as a trilogy (like the Japanese live action adaption). If it is better paced and we have the Light at the end of the current movie, I would actually watch the other 2 movies he had in mind. For those who enjoyed Ryuk, supposedly the second movie is more on the world of Shinigami's and how Ryuk is in the world giving the Death Note to new owners every 7 days. Basically more Ryuk time! That will be exciting because by far the best part of this movie was Ryuk and every scene he was in was amazing!"
gerhardtbwr,Just bad.,01/10,26-Aug-17,"If I could select zero I would. L and Light were portrayed as very mundane people. Watch the anime series instead, there are English versions for those that do not like subtitles. Way too many inconsistencies.I felt compelled to bring the average score of the movie down.

kim-bagestam,An hideous adaptation,01/10,26-Aug-17,"Being a longtime fan of Death Note for over 10 years since the manga and anime came out and it's Japanese live action adaptations, I was somewhat thrilled/enjoyed to hear that an American live action adaptation was in the works and I've eagerly waited for it's release ever since. This movie has forever ruined my excpectations of American live action adaptations. I really liked Lights character in the original anime/manga but in this American version they somehow succeeded in making him an angsty/emo/whatever-kid with issues/troubles just to make him look ""cool"" or something, also at the scene where he meets Ryuk and freaks out and screams that was so way out of Lights character. Also regarding Misa or should I say Mia, that character was horrible thought through as well, she would NEVER even consider writing down Lights name in the Death Note.Characters aside I also think the whole acting and story/setting was horrible, I wish I never saw this movie but I did sadly."
leoxatzian,"You thought ""Dragonball evolution"" was bad ?",02/10,05-Nov-18,"When it comes to live action adaptations of beloved anime, the chances of failure tend to be really high and this is movie is no exception. It not only misrepresents it's source material but it also misses the entire point of it. The characters, story and deeply philosophical and ethical themes of the original are completely thrown out of the window and replaced by an entirely new version that is simply braindead by comparison. Netflix could have given this masterpiece of an anime the adaptation it deserved but they only succeeded in insulting the fans.

sanjin_9632,One MAJOR flaw in the story.,06/10,26-Aug-17,"I thought it was well made. I haven't watched the manga and I'm pretty sure it's much better since it has 37 episodes which means it has more time to develop a better story line. One thing: How is the courtesy of the Death Note extended to the girlfriend? I thought that only the Keeper could write names in it. If anyone can write names, what's the point of being the Keeper? Being the only one who can actually see Ryok? - which would be ridiculous. The whole point of the book is being the only one who can bring death to others. You take away that, the whole thing seems ridiculous. I don't know how the story developed in the manga, but I sure as hell hope it did differently, otherwise this and the manga don't deserve the attention.I've got no issues with the realization (acting, production etc.). 5.5/10 because of the major flaw in the story."
priontie,Not the Death Note I know,05/10,27-Aug-17,"I know this is something that people have put effort into and have spent a lot of time working on so I don't want to be disrespectful but this is not Death Note. I see what they were trying to do and accomplish but they really stripped away the amazing complexities and aspects of the characters and their interactions with each other in this adaptation. My biggest complaint is that they made this into a teen romance thing and completely changed what made Light Turner such a compelling and fascinating character in the original material. And if I were to forget everything I know about the original material, this movie is very simple (""by the numbers"") with hints of interesting concepts, ideas and visuals. And because I know the original material, most of those interesting ideas or lanes of thoughts are from the original material and I know that those concepts have been explored/ displayed in a much better way in previous versions so I really struggled to like this adaptation. I also think this should have been a series and not a movie with what they were trying to do in this adaptation - they packed too much into a small frame of time resulting in a lack of emotional weight and character development."

This... turned out way worse than i expected it to be. 0 PLOT - 0 LOGIC, everyone was just mad, crazy, or running, nothing made any sense. I almost threw up in the first 15 min of the movie, but then i was focusing on not crying and killing myself. Peace out !

cruise01,"Creepy villain and interesting concept but falls short from decent direction, acting, and visuals.",06/10,27-Aug-17,"Death Note the fantasy horror thriller being made into a film all thanks to Netflix. I am coming from a fresh perspective, which has never seen or read the original Japanese source material. I am not sure how accurate this film is or how different. I will say I feel like the supernatural tone with the creepy mysterious death god worked well on screen. Death Note is not terrible or great. It is entertaining for what it is and the theme of the movie tried covering some relatable issues with today's world problems. The performances were decent and the visual effects were mediocre. The films plot gets right to the point. It begins with Light Turner (Nat Wolff) in high school, which is dealing in selling copies of exams answers to students. A mysterious notebook falls to the ground right next to him called ""Death Note."" He soon enough gets caught in the middle of protecting another student from being bullied and gets knocked out himself. Soon enough in detention, a death god Ryuk (voiced by Willem Dafoe) appears and informs Light about the rules of the notebook. Write a name down, how they should get killed, and remember the face when writing the name. Light soon tries it out in trying to get rid of a bully, and then searches for criminals that are escaping the justice system, or on live news feed holding hostages. Light's girlfriend Mia (Margaret Qualley) tries to help with them justifying on who should be executed using this death god. Light's father James (Shea Whigham) is on this trail of mysterious deaths which is trying to stop the body counts from going up. Which creates a divide with the civilians as they believe its Kira known for mysterious god taking out the criminals and the people support the events for doing good to society. While James and an obsessed compulsive detective L (Lakeith Stanfield) is on the trail of Kira, and suspects that it could be someone close that is using the death god. I liked how the plot relates to real world situations such as using the death god to bring down terrorists, criminals, etc. Then, it all has repercussions with how is the society going to react to the crime rate going down. How are the law enforcements going to react that they have possibly a good guy eliminating all the bad people out there? Will they side with the kira? Or will they retaliate to stop it? Since the issue of who decides on who should die or live? It is the questions that Light Turner struggles with, when he wants to do good in the world. But the limits will only get him so far, before his actions will have consequences. Willem Dafoe as the death god is menacing. It is scary looking with his punk rock looking outfit and look. It is something that will give you chills when you see the shadows in the dark. Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley were both decent as Light and Mia. The visual effects were decent. The look on the death god was great. There is some climatic sequence shot on the ferris wheel that looked cheaply made. My issues with the film which I could not stand was Lakeith Stanfield performance. His character is by far the most annoying person you will ever see. A hardcore detective that eats lots of candy to keep his insulin up and has his face covered most of the time and acts like a teenage idiot for an adult by hopping on table's chairs. Lakeith performance still acted like he was the hypnotized person in the Get Out movie. And his performance in Death Note was no different. Also, the direction with the tone felt like it had no idea what it wanted to be if it was teen supernatural comedy or full on thriller. Especially, when characters are falling to their deaths and some love sappy song ends up playing in the scene. Overall, Death Note is a fair film. Nat Wolff and Margaret Qualley were decent. Willem Dafoe was great and menacing. The plot and concept had a nice exploration with the themes. But Lakeith Stanfield was irritating and annoying every time he was on screen. And the direction was becoming incoherent on what kind of tone it wanted to be. I rate the film 3 out of 5 stars."
montana666,Actually a nice movie! Don't listen to the goofs!,09/10,16-Sep-17,"Yes, it is definitely not the TV-series, which are very good and so on, but aren't you guys tired of bashing movies, based on popular games or anime productions, just because they are not the same as the original?It is clearly a nice movie if you stop being a goof, who's comparing it to the TV-series! Why should it even be like the TV-series? What's the point of watching something, that has been already made.. i really don't get that point.I watched it and it didn't seem slow-paced, as some users noted. It is a pointless critique, because this is a movie, that covers all the main stories from the TV-series in just 1 hour and 40 min. How can it be slow? What's slow about it.. things happen very quickly. It is actually the opposite :DAlso, the director has changed some things from the original, which is always a nice approach, when you are creating a new version of something! I don't think that when you are doing an adaptation, in this case a movie based on the series, you have to stick to the main source 100% in every single way. Where is the fun in that?My advice, don't listen to the goofs, who bash it for the wrong reasons and just see it. It is a nice movie at the end of the day. They got the ""antihero"" essence of all characters very nicely, the killings are not all heart attacks, the effects are nice, the acting is okay and it is darker than i expected it to be. Try to watch it, without slumping to the floor, because it is different than the original version."
alexjf1994-12-270064,Please disregard every review that raves about the anime/manga!,07/10,25-Aug-17,"Although this film is nowhere near an instant classic it is not as bad as the reviews make it seem.First of all, this is a re-imagining brought to a Western audience and adapted for film. The original is a 50+ chapter manga, adapted in to a 50+episode anime series. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to accurately cover the entire story in the short time given to Wingard. In my opinion, he did extremely well to cover as much as he did. Secondly, upon adapting, things change and that is a given that needs to be accepted. However, just because it is not a page for page adaptation why does that make it a terrible film? It doesn't. If I could bring a similar example to the table, when our Western heroes like Batman, Spiderman and even Scooby Doo, are re-adapted for the screen there is never ANY complaint about how far away from the source material they are. This is an unfair characteristic that plagues anime adaptations and frankly, for me, is ruining the way other people perceive the source material. Lastly, BASED ON does not mean THE EXACT SAME STORY AS THE SOURCE MATERIAL.This film is enjoyable and fun and should be taken Light-ly. My hope is that it encourages people to find and enjoy the source material and discover one of the greatest stories ever told. I will leave you with a question for all those who still aren't convinced by this film: How would you fit 20 hours of context in to a feature film?"
itsshfn,"Inaccurate, but still entertaining.",07/10,09-Sep-17,"I feel the same about this movie like the X-men & Dark Knight movies. It's own universe for cinematic purposes. I still enjoy watching characters I love come to life. So, don't expect to see specific story arcs or 100% accurate representations of Light(He's a bit of a goof) or L(He's Black *Awesomes*).

laurenbproffitt-572-943898,Not even a little bit good.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"If you are a fan of the original Japanese manga or anime then do not watch this. I know there are always changes when adapting to film, but this is so loosely based on the original content that I'm a little ""butt-hurt"" that it's titled Death Note. Light is not portrayed as a genius or even as having a little more than above average intelligence.His mother and sister are not even existent in the film, and The rules of the death note were not correct at all. the only rules stated about it were changed or added for the film. this is the worst book to film adaption that I have ever witnessed. On a slightly redeeming note, L's character was well played in comparison to the rest of the film. If this is your first experience with Death Note, the story moves too fast and is confusing to watch. It's another teenage love story that has no underlying moral lesson or anything to provoke deeper thought. It does have some nice slightly over the top death scenes. In conclusion if I could give this 0 stars I would. I gave it a chance because I thought Willem Dafoe was a great choice to cast for Ryuk. I hoped it would not be as bad as I suspected it would be and went in with an open mind. It turns out my expectations were wrong. It was worse."
VVMini,A complete mess,03/10,17-Sep-17,"Having never seen or know anything about the original series, I went in open minded. I was aware of the negative reviews it had received, but I am also aware that oftentimes such negative feedback is largely because fanboys tend to complain about any little detail that is different from the original source material. There's plenty of adaptations that I've enjoyed despite the backlash, including the recent Ghost in the Shell adaptation. So I was ready to be pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, in this case the bad reviews were more than justified. This movie is a complete mess from start to finish. Storywise, while it has some interesting ideas, it is completely rushed. It's clear that this was meant to be a multi-episode story, and not a 100 minute long film because the story moves at such a fast pace that it is near incomprehensible. We go from Light (which is a laughably dumb name btw, at least in a Western setting) being gifted the book, to him creating a god-worshipping movement and being chased down by law enforcement in no time. There was no time to let any of the events sink in, and it was hard to buy or care for any of it as a result. The relationship between Light and Mia was similarly rushed. They barely even know each other at the beginning and half way through they are already deeply and inseparably in love. I simply didn't buy it. While the overall premise is interesting, there's nothing in this movie to suggest me that both Light and definitely Mia aren't straight up psychopaths. Being a wildly anti-vigilante person myself I don't believe in any form of revenge as suitable justice, and I am already almost always on the other side of the people we are supposed to root for in these kinds of stories. I'm sure that in the original series there were plenty of layers of gray, but starting of with decapitating a bully definitely isn't helping me get on their side. The ending, which was I guess supposed to be emotional, just left me indifferent, since I so disliked both of these characters. In fact, the dad was the only likable and reasonable character in this entire movie. L was just annoying and it really bothered me that he had the backing of the entire police force based on absolutely no evidence whatsoever. A lot of the ending scenes left me incredibly confused, and I think it's because of a scene halfway through in which Light says something along the lines of 'it is a good thing I am the owner' in response to Mia's insane suggestions of how to use the book. That interaction heavily implies that only the owner can control the book. Obviously that wasn't actually the case, but the writing certainly didn't make that clear, leaving me confused at all the flashback type scenes that explained what truly happened. I was also very disappointed that they didn't explain a little more about Ryuk and his background. I kept thinking there was going to be some sort of reveal, but it never came. Even the 'be aware of Ryuk' message ultimately didn't amount to anything. But all of this is just the story elements and poor script. The movie might have been somewhat saved if the other elements were at least good. But unfortunately almost everything in this movie was poor. Some of the acting was simply awful. Nat Wolff continues to leave me baffled as to how he became a professional actor, and that is definitely not a good thing if that is your lead performance. None of the surrounding actors were much better, although I did like Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Ryuk. However, what truly struck me as the worst aspect of the movie was the directing and cinematography. The cinematographer must have gone to the Battlefield Earth school of cinematography because he was unable to keep his camera at a straight angle. Considering the consistency of those Dutch angles it must have been a conscious decision, but I have no idea who thought it would be a good idea. It looks amateurish and is wildly distracting. I love good cinematography, but if you're unable to make anything stand out positively, at least make sure that it doesn't stand out negatively either. So a poorly paced, incomprehensible story, combined with poor acting and directing makes for a very poor film. To end on a positive note, I'll list the few things I did like. One, I really liked the musical score. It had a cool supernatural and mysterious vibe to it. I also really liked the design of Ryuk, as well as Willem Dafoe's voice to go along with it. Thirdly, I quite like the overall concept of the story, which cannot even be credited to the writers of this movie. Still, those three points make me give Death Note a generous 3/10"
Stonesnort,Terrible adaptation of classic manga,01/10,01-Sep-17,"Started bad and got worse till I gave up 45 minutes in. Classic example of Hollywood ruining great material. Added a pointless love interest, main character Light is changed from a brilliant sociopath student who doesn't care about the implications of what he is doing to an emo moron, and detective ""L"" who is more than a match for the brilliant Light of the original manga does stupid and baffling things. Waste of time.

Pumpkin_Man,Very Intriguing!!!,07/10,13-Sep-18,"I don't watch anime and I don't read manga. I avoid it like the plague. That being said, I have heard about this and wanted to give it a try. All my anime-loving friends refuse to watch it, but I was able to see it with a fresh perspective without being able to compare it to its source material. For this type of movie, I really liked it. I was a little confused by the ending, because I thought it ended a little abruptly, but I liked the concept of having a 'death note' and writing down names of bad people and having it kill them!A high school student named Light Turner finds the 'Death Note' and begins to read the rules. Along with the book, he starts seeing a creepy death god named Ryuk. Light starts by killing bullies, then criminals, pedophiles, mafia and eventually the power gets to his head. He meets a girl named Mia and they start using the book together. Hot on their trail is a highly intelligent FBI profiler known only as L. Will Light be able to get away with it, or will Ryuk pass the book on to a new owner? If you're a newcomer or like the book/anime, you might enjoy DEATH NOTE!!!"
mikestarr_89,Whats with all the bad reviews. this movie was pretty good,09/10,01-Sep-17,"Let me start off by saying all the negative reviews must be from anime fan-boys. for people who have no interest in the original Death Note (Anime Version) this movie is actually pretty good. it's not without problems, but it defiantly deserves more credit than what it's getting. I personally thought it could have gone on a bit longer. the music in this movie is amazing and suits it as though it was made for the movie... DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR and check this movie out. for you lovers of the Amine version, don't go into this movie expecting it to be anything like that...the acting was pretty good. Nat Wolff is great, Lakeith Stanfield is great, Willem Dafoe as the voice of Ryuk.... AMAZING.... no one else could have done it so well... Fingers crossed for a sequel 8/10 Solid effect in my opinion!

fkruse-40704,"Not as good as the original, but still good.",07/10,25-Aug-17,"(HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD)This movie was slammed with controversy the second it was announced, as people accused the director of whitewashing. I was interested in the film because I had seen the original Death Note and I loved the story. I knew this film would be different, but after all, it was an adaptation, not a word by word recreation of the original story. When I sat down to watch this, I cleansed my mind, and acted as if this was all new to me. You never judge an adaptation by how it stuck true to the original story. You judge it how you would judge any other film. And this is what I did. Nat Wolff was an excellent cast for Light Turner. His acting is getting better with every movie he stars in, and this is no exception. Light was a very twisted and unpredictable individual, which is why I was a bit disappointed at first with the relationship between him and Mia. However, they redeemed themselves with the Ferris Wheel scene, but I still felt a bit confused after Mia's death. L showed himself to be very cunning and mysterious, so when he suddenly murdered Light at the end of the movie, I was a bit shocked, not in a good way. I would've preferred if Light had maybe killed himself, realizing it was all over, sort of like the anime. In fact, I'd be okay with most other endings, but this was not one of them. There were a couple of plot holes throughout the movie as well? How did L know that the Death Note really worked? Why did Light's phone change from a flip phone to a smart phone? Among many, many others. Overall, I gave the film a generous 7 out of 10. I loved the believable acting, the twists from the original story, and the castings the directors made. I wasn't a fan of the plot twists and characters who seemingly didn't stick to the personas they gave at the beginning of the movie. You either like this movie or you don't, there is no in between. I personally liked the movie, but it's up to you to watch it and decide if you like it or not. If you haven't seen the original anime or read the manga, go for it. You'd probably like it a lot. If you have seen the original story, however, try to have an open mind if you do decide to watch this film. Maybe you'll surprise yourself and enjoy it somewhat like me."
tantricbuddha86,Death note -- Hollywood keeps destroying good ideas,01/10,27-Aug-17,"Let me preface this review by saying that I was never a huge fan of the original death note anime. In particular, I really disliked the last half of the show, but I think many people felt that way as well. At the same time, there was some merit in this particular property with interesting themes and characters which made it note worthy for any anime fan. The live action film has very few scraps of the original left in it. Lakeith Stanfield puts in a very faithful and decent performance as the detective L. (its as though he was the only one who actually took the time to watch the anime.) The movie continues with typical Hollywood trends despite itself. You can forgive the white washing in movies if the source material does not specifically stipulate that the plot is tied to a specific culture. In the case of the recent ""Ghost in the Shell"" movie for instance, the white washing was completely unforgivable because of how central new Tokyo and Japanese culture are to the story of that particular anime. With ""Death Note"", Light being Japanese and L being British is not a necessity; also very little of the plot necessitates that the story take place in Japan. Death Note could have had an Original plot that made it an American take on the source material. It could have featured small throw backs and nods to the original source and still dealt with the same themes and ideas of the original without being trash. This is not the direction that the director and writers decided to use in this case. Aside from the look and sound of Ryuk as well as the mannerisms and logic of Stanfield's L; nothing in this movie really calls back to the source. Instead of being a cerebral thriller style story, we get a action film filled with teenage angst and a fairly weak set of main characters. We are told at the beginning of the film that Light is a smart person but we are never shown this in the movie. Gone is the cold yet logically invincible character from the anime and in his place is a shallow and vapid teenager. The Misa character is even worse. Mia is not the same pretty girl who tries to worm her way into Light's heart while staying relatively ignorant to the consequences of her own actions. Mia is more manipulative then Light and yet her character is rather dim and shallow. Most importantly, the character dynamics are more or less destroyed by these walking clichés. Light and Mia's dynamic is completely different with Mia taking the lead for most of the story. Ryuk comes across as more menacing and less silly. His relationship with light seems to only exist as a red herring for a convoluted plot arc later in the movie. Part of the reason why Ryuk and Lights relationship was important in the original source was because it showed how little Light respected the natural order of things. It showed how prepared he was to try to use everything and anything to get what he wanted and it further punctuated his goal of becoming the god of the new world. Even if you didn't watch the anime, I honestly don't see you really enjoying this story. It is filled with plot holes and silly contrivances which try to be clever but aren't."
dmouzayek,Never knew there was an Anime version... but I liked it,09/10,30-Jun-19,"I'm from a background where I've never watched Anime, therefore I never even knew this was an adaption of something else when I watched this movieAnd I liked it a lot! The concept is great (which I now know credit is to the original story)
The actors were cool. The movie had an intriguingly eerie theme to it. The song choices were mesmerising. But yeah the story makes you wonder what would you do?If this movie was the original, it wouldn't have been absolutely destroyed like it hasI know what it feels like to be a fan of something and see it get destroyed time and time again by Hollywood, so I get the anger

I really do not understand why it got such a low rating and bad reviews.Put the lights out, grab your bowl of popcorn, pour some wine and sit back on the sofa and enjoy this master piece. Well written and directed. Cast is excellent and well acted.It is dark, twisted and is full of twists and turns. Also while watching keep an eye on the background, you may catch a glimpse of the excellent creature.I do not know what else I can say about this epic movie.

javier_garcon-47-656552,Not the Original story or characters.,08/10,25-Aug-17,"I see a lot of hostility in the comments section and it is not warranted, there is a small percentage of people that has watched or read the original Death Note and that is probably what the director was basing his statistics on that if he would make a movie about something most people would understand then its popularity will increase. I am unsure if the anime is understandable or can relate to today's world with Trump being President, yes people that are reading this I am talking about normal people that have a job and no time to play video games or watch anime instead they take the weekend to go out with their friends or families to see a movie, Life is more important than a movie! Now the review, I am surprised how well the director and writers scripted this movie, fantastic lighting and good voices, It was hilarious how he freaked out in the beginning inside the school, This is the classic story of a boy sharing his super powers to his girl and the girl just wants to use him for his powers then finds a way to destroy him.... sounds familiar? It does to me and it rings true to my life more than once. What is my super power? Just like L your not going to find out! nor will you ever know my real name."

zhadow900,"While different from the anime, Death Note is an enjoyable adaption",07/10,25-Aug-17,"While different from the anime, and surely the manga, Death Note is an enjoyable adaption. If you watched the anime, you know that the series's first episode titled ""Rebirth"" starts out in the Shinigami Realm. We unfortunately do not see this scene or ever visit the Shinigami Realm but I think that's just fine for this adaption as when we meet Ryuk for the first time, it's so cool and terrifying at the same time. The film didn't feel rushed despite having a fast pace but I never felt lost. In addition, the killings were gruesome. Also let me just say Margaret Qualley is bae to unbelievable max. Her Mia Sutton (originally Misa Amane) is just UGH <3 Nat Wolff was actually fairly decent as Light Turner (originally Light Yagami). Keith Stanfield as L was different but not totally in a negative way. And as expected, WILLEM DAFOE AS RYUK IS PERFECT!"
Mabie,At least better than the last part of the original,06/10,28-May-23,"I liked the ending, it wasn't as over the top as the original. But L was poorly portrayed. Also that some psycho woman is de facto behind Light was not so good. It actually made Light not seem as intelligent as he actually was. Why the demon here had so many stubborn opinions is also a mystery to me. Why they had to include Japan at all, if they wanted to fix the setting on America, is incomprehensible to me and also unnecessary. And that one had to make an obviously, in the original, white figure, here forcibly black is also stupid. But otherwise it was ok. The death scenes were well done and reminded me of Final Destination. And what Light did at the end was really well thought out. So a 6 for me. Or rather a 5,5 but that's not possible here."
d_arc_knight,A Disappointing Adaptation,01/10,23-May-23,"""Death Note"" (2017) falls far short of its source material, delivering a disappointing and misguided adaptation. The film fails to capture the essence of the beloved manga and anime series, losing its dark and intricate storytelling in favor of a shallow and convoluted plot. The performances lack depth and fail to resonate with the complex characters they portray. The film's attempts at suspense and psychological tension are undermined by poor pacing and questionable creative choices. Ultimately, ""Death Note"" is a regrettable adaptation that fails to honor the original material or provide a compelling cinematic experience.

christoffersen366,Enjoyable but disappointing for fans,06/10,26-Aug-17,"It is really a decent attempt at boiling the series down into a movie, and at making its own so it will be worth watching for fans and newcomers alike, but it didn't really succeed, as ultimately it fails the fans.Mostly the problems lies with the format and the main character. -Format: The only way it could do the whole story justice as a movie, is to be a movie series, at least two, but they really tried boiling it into one, which means they had to sacrifice a lot, too much. -Main character: Light is not done very well. A big part of the story is that the government want to stop him, and L (a super smart investigator) is taking point in that investigation. So Light has to be a good strategist to avoid being caught, which he originally was, but here he really isn't, and it's really the main trait of the character and the story, with no replacement given.It's still a decent movie, both L and Ryuk are done very well and the story is okay. And they could still turn it around in a follow-up movie, making this a good start to establish and make the characters grow. But as is, I can't really suggest it to fans, but anyone else would probably enjoy it."
jhgstrm,absolute crap.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"titles says it.it butcher all the things that made the original series brilliant. the original had so much more of and was so much better at everything.. from the characters motivation and principals to the rules of the death note and the nail biting pacing and storytelling that kept you watching an 11+ hour epic. everything was better done in the original and you'll find none of same brilliant storytelling in this movie. don't waist your time. it's crap. its actually worse than crap. its poison in the well.

canhdemir,Just boring and feels wrong,02/10,25-Aug-17,"First of all, I really don't mind L being black and the other characters not being Japanese. Some people really freak out about this kind of stuff but the casting is actually decent: Lakeith Stainfield does a good job portraying that weird but highly intelligent persona of L. Willem Dafoe's costume as Ryuk, his voice and laughter fits just perfectly. But that's unfortunately it, there is nothing positive to point out more than that. The main issue I have with this adaptation is that Light is not displayed properly. In the source material he is this highly intelligent, bright, handsome and beloved guy. That's why in the source material his understanding of a world without crime makes him so interesting. He thinks everything through, just like L. The moment these two clash against each other makes the whole manga/anime amazing. Here though, Light fells like a dumbass. He makes too many mistakes that are easily avoidable and nothing of his intelligence is actually shown. The other issue I have is how Ryuk is displayed. Even though Willem Dafoe does a good job, Ryuks character just doesn't feel right. In the source material he pretty much stays neutral. Here he actively pushes Light into certain decisions which makes Light look like an idiot. All in all just watch the animated series if want to know what Death note is. Or read the manga. But it's sad to see that Hollywood again failed to make a proper adaptation of a manga/anime."
elliottlecointe,Look at how they massacred my boy,03/10,07-Aug-20,"Death Note is my favourite TV show of all time, it is such a terrific show with great characters and writingThis movie is the opposite of thatAt least Ryuk was cool

boboklid,"Terrible, hideous, awful and appalling",02/10,27-Aug-17,"Dreadful does not even begin to describe this... My name written in the Death note would be the sweetest redemption one could ever wish for. As it is aforementioned, the movie was hideous and appalling. From acting, through the alternations from the original series to the character management. SPOILERS AHEAD Setting aside the fact that L was, ehm, Afro-American (I am not racist, but he just did not do a good job acting L and in my opinion he simply did not fit into the character of L), he was also poorly conducted. In the series, if I recall correctly, L was mentally stable. Not here he ain't. The one thing I actually quite liked about Death Note from Netflix, was the choice of actor for Light Yagami. Not that Nat performed him perfectly but his face and visage sort of fitted to my mind as young Yagami. Ryuk was also okay-ish made but also misconducted. He is not supposed to be malicious to humans, let alone Light, he just did it for entertainment. Oh and thanks for giving Ryuk utterly no back story whatsoever."
rachaelperson,The pain...,01/10,18-Sep-22,"Death Note 2017 is what happens when you let an ""auteur"" put his own spin on source material he clearly doesn't understand. Wingard isn't an untalented director, but this is seriously embarrassing. The original anime series is already so beloved, you'd think a live-action adaptation would be carefully made to stay in the fans' good graces. Apparently not, though, because anything that worked in the show is thrown out. What's left is essentially a rejected Final Destination script.Anything that could have been a redeeming quality is squashed, too. The special effects were dated when the movie came out, and it's even worse now. The acting gave me second-hand embarrassment half the time. Willem Dafoe as Ryuk, one of the movie's only interesting ideas, is criminally underused.I don't have a problem with an adaptation that's wildly different from the source material. I do have a problem with destroying the charm of the source material and making a mockery of it. This is the latter. This was a joyless experience. It's seriously, SERIOUSLY not worth your time."
xpressva-59745,OH MY GOD WOULD YOU ANIME MANGA WHATEVER PEOPLE SHUT UP,08/10,19-Apr-18,"I do not watch anime or whatever the original was called. I am so sick of fans that wanted this to be like the original. Why would you want a carbon copy? None of those people even gave this a chance. They went into this with their mind already made up. I am convinced half of them never even watched this. There is nothing wrong with this move at all. Movie is very entertaining. If you are a dan of the original, GO WATCH IT and leave this movie alone.

Edvis-1997,It wasn't so bad as everyone says,05/10,22-Mar-18,"I'm fan of horror films so I expected more blood,kills,deaths,more horror from this movie but it didn't happen. The film wasn't really so bad it was quite enjoyable , of course there are many shortcoming of the plot e.g. from where the book came? What happened to former owners of the book? How hunter L(policeman dude) could have known that people die only when killer knows their names and sees their faces, it's just theory from nowhere? There is no end of the movie, did that guy died in hospital or he didn't? All in all,if you have free time better watch this film instead of television"
helwazan,someone please make Hollywood stop anime adaptations,03/10,27-Aug-17,"Dragon Ball evolution, Ghost in the Shell and now Death note, all these movies that were adopted in the recent years mistreated it source material, replacing one of the masterpieces in anime ""Death Note"" with just a teenage drama is a pure insult to the original series, the battle Between L and Light was supposed to be one of the best iconic mind battles in the history of anime, but it was simply reduced to a simple conclusion from L and that's about it the story ended, the movie skips a great deal of info and just says Light is Kira and thank you for watching, in the original series L made a master plan, pure genius to find where is Kira located, but the movie just says he is located there we will go to find him,the ending of the movie was what really got on my nerves, L finds a piece of the Death Note and he grabs a pen and then the END, i think they were hoping for a sequel but i hope that never happens.If Hollywood wants to adopt anime to the American culture i get that, but at least replace the story with something completely different and don't use the names or anything from the source material as if someone else used the Death Note instead of light. at the end i would never recommend anyone watching this movie, watch the original Anime its a pure masterpiece."
tirsojrp,"Total waste of time, it misses so much...",01/10,25-Aug-17,"I wasn't expecting the deep mind games and plot from the original series, but WTF were they thinking? The character development, the moral dilemmas... nothing is here.Light, from a Psychopath/Narcissistic to a prick scared of his shadow, manipulated by the craziest girl from school, making choices based on anger and resentment, daddy issues... The original was someone who though he deserved the power of the Dead Note, a character who made you question if he was doing the right thing or at least doing it for the right reasons. L, this guy is intentionally arrogant and seems scared and out of control most of the time. This leads to:Light vs L... this is a mud fight, the plot tries to hard and fails miserably. They try to make the viewer feel empathy for Light and his justification to use the The Dead Note, but makes him too vulnerable and yet L fails to solve it...This is a teen movie, high school drama, bullies, emo kids, love affairs...Go watch the original series, you can watch 5 chapters in the time you would waste in this movie."
taddycat,Great and interesting,09/10,06-Sep-23,"I have not watched any death note movie prior to this. I'm not familiar with the story. I don't know why people are so upset and rated this movie low. Just get over the fact it's a different movie.That's being said, I started watching a different movie and happened to see this. I needed something for background noise so I clicked on it. From the beginning, it was interesting. A high school boy getting bullied by the stereotypical jerk. Then he happens to find a strange book with names inside it and rules. He is then visited by a death angel named Ryuk who explains the rules of the book. The rules reveal he can put a name on the page while he thinks of the persons face and can decide how the person is to die. The kid is faced with tough decisions and egged on by the Ryuk to kill people or get rid of the book.It's actually a pretty interesting premise that I hadn't seen and I'm rather glad I clicked on it. It's not predictable and keeps you entertained to the end. I love horror movies and am tired of the same stories regurgitated. This is definitely a good movie and deserves better than a 4.8. Don't pay attention to those that can't appreciate different takes on things."
srupane,Absolute garbage.,01/10,27-Dec-17,"Why do people want to take a well loved anime and turn it into a pile of shit i never actually understand. If you want to create a real life adaptation of classic anime atleast have a decency to hire a director who loves them and knows how to make them come real. Please dont night shyamalan our beloved animes anymore.

mousm,The epic failure of turning a super successful show to horrible American style movie,02/10,26-Aug-17,"I don't know where to start but I am sure that all those watched the original anime share my conclusion that those were the worst 1 hr 41 minutes one can ever spend watching a movie, from the very beginning of the movie it was terrible and It wasn't going anywhere near the anime, they took the story line and turned it into a boring terrible American drama movie. I am not going to say anything more but this movie doesn't worth wasting your time.

jasonpwcarey,DEATH NOTE is the Final Destination Remake No One wanted,03/10,26-Aug-17,"The RealThis movie is insane! The death scenes are graphic and jaw dropping. Its like Deathnote puts a face to the Death God behind all of the Final Destination movie deaths. Lakeith Stanfield (L) and Willam Dafoe (Ryuk) are my favorite parts of this movie. Outside of that it's basically a white teenager who thinks he should decide who lives and dies in his Utopian world with the help of a Death Notebook. Nothing attracts a serial killer like a psychotic girlfriend played by Mia Sutton. In the end Playing God is not designed for mere mortals.SynopsisDeath Note is a jaw dropping visual dream of a Japanese manga turned live action. While dealing with the sudden death of his mother Light Turner stumbles across a mystical book that has the power to kill anyone who's name is written in it. With his God like powers he seeks justice against the wicked, with the help of his Death God. L, a wunderkind detective, seeks to bring Light to justice for taking matters into his own hands and thus a game of cat and mouse envelopes.Death Note is based off of a classic Anime by the same name. I am typically against Manga to live action conversions mainly because I have yet to see a single one executed flawlessly. For the record, the Death scene within the first 15 minutes is pretty dramatic but it seems to go down hill from there. The best part about this movie is William Dafoe who plays the voice of Ryuk. Apart from that Death Note seems to be plagued by the typical problems associated with Manga to live action adoptions that translate into an inadequate adaptation.Light Turner's Nemesis appears in the form of L, an enlightened detective trained from the age of 6 by a secret order. In between avoiding L and trying to grasp the full concept of Death Note, Light Turner struggles to keep his head above water. Aside from the spectacular death scenes, Death Note appears to be lacking in content, with many questions remaining after the credits start rolling.Review: 👎"
ShanTeaTime,No...Just No. Not Even Close.,01/10,13-Apr-20,"I am so sick and tired of these americanized movies attempting to adapt anime source material. You would think we learned from Dragonball, Avatar The Last Airbender and now this. The Death Note anime is one of my top anime series of all time, and also just one of my favorite television shows. It's so beautifully executed. Intelligent, thrilling, well animated, has an amazing soundtrack. It's characters are compelling. Up until L ultimately dies, the series is pretty perfect. Even afterwards it's done well, but just doesn't hold a candle to the first half of the series.Now...we have this. This movie is so disrespectful of its source material, which seems to be a trend with these type of adaptations. The director doesn't even come close to its source material, even setting that aside this movie would still be pretty trash. Everything that made the original series great isn't shown here. I like many others were surprised to see the casting. Now I didn't necessarily think we needed an asian actor to play Light or Misa or L even. Whitewashing is a very real problem in filmmaking, however I didn't go there in this case. Since in the anime/manga they are drawn looking more westernized, which is pretty common in Japan. They're characters after all, so they have overly eccentric features and attributes. So I didn't necessarily care about the casting as long as it was good. Unfortunately it just wasn't.Light's actor is god awful. Now I understand Light is a very VERY difficult character to play. Not only is he a genius psychopath whose masking his inner thoughts constantly, but have you seen his facial expressions in the anime? He's either non-expressive or outlandishly revealing. That's not easy to do and this actor just can't pull it off, he just doesn't have that range. So Light is resorted to being a screaming obnoxious main character. Misa is put in a position of being more manipulative, which isn't her character at all! The screenplay literally skimmed the manga and thought ""oh wait! They're a couple right? Let's add in some romance!"" Which is so beneath the source material. So we get a force-fed romance that we never wanted.L is alright, however for some reason he's a vigilante kind of in this movie? His character utilizes his intelligence to his advantage, but never ever does he wave a gun in the anime or attempt to chase down suspects. What the hell was that!? He's also wearing a hoodie constantly which bugged me. His character is so weird and quirky, but in the film he's stripped down to nothing as well. Where's the barefooted, cake eating boy we all love!Ryuk is actually the best part of this movie. Willem Dafoe voicing him was a brilliant idea and it works! However, his humor isn't quite on par and being surrounded by the rest of this terrible movie...it was impossible to salvage anything. He looks pretty great too, even amongst the poorly lit boring sets they plopped him in. Sure the anime wasn't super colourful or anything (except for the red/blue contrast which NEVER HAPPENS IN THIS) but you can make a scene visually stimulating without bright colours.I honestly wish this film was never made, because I don't want people to think this is what Death Note is, it definitely isn't! Watch the anime, get immersed and forget about this movie."
finaldestination-g,Very entertaining,09/10,01-Sep-17,"I will keep it short, as someone who has a life and cannot commit to watch the full length of the original animated cartoon, this movie was really entertaining. Acting was good, storyline was entertaining and characters were interesting. If you are watching to pass 2 hours of your time with something entertaining and fun, this movie is for you.

milovanbalandzic,Wooow i read other reviews and i didn't think its bad but after watching it....,01/10,03-Sep-17,"I watched anime, where Light is extremely smart teen, he was able to manipulate people, he didn't have mean less relationships, he untested batter, he didn't blab about death note to first attractive girl, he wasn't bullied, no one couldn't belie that guy. He had one goal and all thing that he did was a ladder for reaching that goal. He used one girl witch was in love with him, he saw that she is easy to manipulate, not to make love with her like this stupid guy did. While watching this i felt that i need to watch again anime just to remember how good it is, and i hope it will help me to forget this crap.That was about Light.Now time to spend on LOn start (just first minute of L's screen time) i felt they did good job... And that feeling was gone after that minute. L should be super calm guy, who analyses everything, he did analyze a lot here but about his real character they only did good job on eating candies and nothing else, like anime Light (he was sentimental only for hes father and no one else), L wasn't sentimental at all, he was pure genius, and not hot headed guy who flips out after his ''battler'' dies. Time for Death note.And here it comes if i remember clearly there where around 10 rules in note, but here we have only 60 how fun right. And they tell us only 5-6 rules at top. Where is rule where it says when some one gives up on note he forget ever having it in his possession, that was Lights key for beating L, here he didn't even bath him, or its made unclear. Here they left that much for suspicion that L is not going to kill Light because thy hope that they will get budget for next movie...ARE YOU SERIOUS WHO WILL IN RIGHT MIND GIVE MONEY TO MAKE ONE MORE OF THIIIIS. Did wright er for this even considered that they should watch closely anime first before writing this crap.I could wright book about what is wrong here, but i will stop now.And for the last sorry about my spelling, English is not my native language."
kikkerstikker,(spoiler alert kind of),01/10,26-Aug-17,"Hii. I don't normally write reviews.. honestly I had to make an account just to write this. I just have to say that, as a fan of the anime Death Note. I am highly disappointed in this movie. You could've made such a good movie, but instead made the total opposite of the actual anime. I suggest, next time you make a movie based on a good show, you actually watch it ^^. I don't know why you felt the need to make Mia (whom I assume is supposed to be Misa) more Light than Light himself is... also why is Light a loser in this movie? I hate Light, but he was anything but a loser. By the way Ryuk eats the whole apple, and doesn't leave the core."
finraziel,Better than the anime fans make it out to be,06/10,21-Oct-17,"I have not seen the anime. As such, I am rating this film on its own and as such I would say it's not great, but it's not terrible either. It feels a bit rushed and a lot of things are glossed over just to be able to get the story done in 90 minutes, but the ending felt satisfying to me. It's not the best movie Netflix has ever put out, but it's fine to fill a rainy Saturday afternoon with. If you haven't seen the anime that is. If you have I can imagine you'd be annoyed by lots of things, but then has any live action movie spin off from an anime ever lived up to the expectations?

najmdafuntion,Its different but that's what makes it interesting and fresh..,10/10,27-Aug-17,"Alright first of all if you have not watched the Death Note anime or read the manga, this is a pretty good movie you can watch on Netflix. After that I would suggest you watch the anime because not only is it the best anime, its a great TV show in general.For the Death Note anime/manga fans, here is the deal...this version is different from the anime/manga in a lot of ways...What that means is that they could have easily made this movie a sequel to the anime/manga, by only changing the names of the characters (entirely), due to the fact that the lore/world is the same but the characters are totally different. Light Turner is a very different Light. Same goes for L and Mia, but here is the deal, that is what makes it fresh. I am a guy who has watched the anime, read the manga and I have also watched the three Japanese movies and even though in this movie, the setup is a little bit different, it is the world of Death Note and I liked this take on it.

JordanMccPhoto,Who is this even for?,01/10,01-May-19,"Death Note may be proof that even the best stories will never be safe in the hands of the vacuous movie dumping ground Netflix is becoming. One could teach a masterclass in bad filmmaking using this film as the curriculum. The problem one faces when trying to tackle a movie this infamously bad, is the questions of morality surrounding the tackling of a horse that's been beaten to death so badly, it's been reduced to a pile of mush.The biggest problem death note faces is it's characters. The American versions of the characters are so devoid of their original traits that one would be right to question why they didn't just make a new story with different characters. The movie ensures the audience that Light is a bright individual, only to show him failing to make a single smart decision through the films runtime. Genius detective L is shown to be the smartest person in a script full of idiots, only to devolve into an emotional wreck, betraying the cool and calculated traits he's known for. Mia is possibly the worst part of the entire film. She is changed from a sympathetic character who is used to only further goals of Light, to an edgy cheerleader who wants to kill people at the drop of a hat.The choice to make this a movie rather than a mini-series is another reason it was
doomed from the start. Death Note is supposed to be a complex game of intellectual chess, but it's been turned into watching two bimbos who would probably try to eat the chess piece. Had they more time to spend building interesting characters and tension, it might have worked. Instead, Death Note opted to sprint to the finish line, only to stumble out the gate and faceplant in its own excrement.There are other problems with the film, but an attempt to tackle all of them would be to spiral into absolute madness.If you're not a fan of the original, there's no reason to watch this film. If you are, it's quite possibly the best hate watch film in recent years."
marioqpineda,Not only a terrible adaptation but a bad film as well,01/10,23-Mar-19,"There is not much to say that hasn't been already said but this is a really bad film with wrong soundtrack choices, anticlimactic acting, badly written, don't know how some critics praised the direction of the film because that's one of the reasons why it doesn't work, even friends with no knowledge about the source material at all saw it and got bored at how bad it was. Some actors overreacted when they were in certain situations which didn't feel credible at all or were really cliche. The only thing that works in the film is ryuk thanks to Willem Dafoe.

sarahsonnenschein,Whitewashed crap,01/10,27-Aug-17,"I'm a fan of the original and this is absolutely horrible. I hate to say it, but it feels like Netflix just wanted a quick buck and didn't care about the result. In the original Light is calm and the perfect psychopath, while in this he's emotional. All of the characters are changed, which is alright in some cases, but in this case they ruined well thought out, deep characters by making them flat and boring. Everything is changed for the worse. It feels like the makers didn't even watch the anime nor read the manga, just read a brief summarize of the original and made a movie based on that. They whitewashed the characters by casting white Americans instead of Japanese actors and it seems like they just threw in a dark skinned actor to even it all out. They even changed the names to make them more white sounding. I'm very disappointed."
drjay_87,My word this is bad...,01/10,15-Jul-18,"If the DN existed in real life everyone associated with this film would need to be really worried. The anime was interesting and engaging this film is just shameful parody at best and disgusting exploitation at worst.

bertd-12305,Netflix needs to stop adapting properties!,01/10,14-Dec-18,This movie fails to stand on its and as an adaptation of Death Note.
redn_path01,So many angry reviewers!,06/10,29-Aug-17,"I've never heard of Death Note till watching this movie. Thus! Nothing to compare against, no unrealistic expectations and none of this quite impressive spectacle of anime fan hate that is prevalent in the other reviews!It is an okay movie. Perhaps not one that shall be watched twice, but also nothing that makes me regret watching it. Not quite sure what to classify it as - at first it seemed something like horror, but then it turned comical and hard to rationalize with the addition of the ""L""-character. Not because of the acting, but the way the character was written. Whether this was intentional or not, I cannot tell, though it seems like this may be due to poor plot planning, since the pacing does not make sense at times. I wish they would have elaborated a bit more on the demon fella, there was not really anything shared in terms of his backstory, so I can only speculate.People who give this movie 1 star ratings really, REALLY should take a close look at the worst ever b-movie productions out there. Plenty of examples in this year alone. Those deserve 1 star. This does not.This should be quite watchable for people who have no idea what the movie is gonna be about!"
dimimagno,Horrible,01/10,25-Aug-17,"It's OK if you have brain damage or if you've never watched a good movie or any movie at all in your life. However, if you watched the anime and read the manga, never will you find a bigger disappointment than this attempt. Americanism at its worst. Light is an utter loser and an idiot, and L is a drama queen and an emotionally driven mule. With such a great source material why would anyone just ignore it to invent ridiculously cheesy plot holes and barf-generating teenage-girl- like emotions? Sad to be a human."
shamzin-35127,"Loved it. People who are overly concerned with race should notice that in Japan, they remake every show with asian actors.",10/10,08-Apr-22,"I liked the race switch. Honestly, I dont want to watch a show about Japan that much. It also was far better then the original in logistics.The Death Note anime is admired mostly because of the gruesome nature of the story. Not because its well written.To start with in the original, how is it that they have Light under surveillance, but to watch only rather then to listen? Also, why wouldn't they notice that the guy suddenly bought a small tv and started sticking his head into a potato chip bag. How many people even stick their head in a. Bag of snacks like Winnie the Pooh?This is FAR BETTER then the anime or manga.

minionking777,Great companion to the anime!,09/10,19-Sep-17,"Ignore the crybabies! I'm a Death Note fan, and I thought that the movie was a wonderful homage to the anime! Of course, not everything will directly correlate because you can't fit but so much into 1:40. Death Note is a very in depth, thinky story, which could only be put into movie format by altering a few things and rushing others. This movie is a fun take on the idea of Death Note. It's a great stand alone movie, as well.

grimah-35656,Good movie if you separate it from the anime or have never seen the anime..,07/10,25-Aug-17,"I've seen the anime which I liked, though did not like the last act. I still went in with a fresh mind. I don't care if they change source material, they bought the rights they can do what they want. I viewed this separately as different stories.Now this is a good movie, the characters and plot is different to the anime but it still works for what story this is trying to tell. It's darker, and more horror-esk and the twists are interesting.And from a fan of the anime, i think this story/version is fine and gets the same points across. I'd prefer this to cramming down the whole anime into a movie length and have trouble introducing characters, just like the attack of titan live action.

EntertainmentBuff,Bad Reviews Are From Fans of the Original,07/10,26-Aug-17,"Tons of bad reviews for the movie because of the casting and the story that was adapted to be a modern American story. This happens on any Anime remake that is adapted to an American story. Luckily I am not into Anime (I'm an adult that doesn't live with their mom that doesn't spend all year wondering what I will wear at the next convention...j/k lol) and never saw the original. Judging it on it's own, it is not a bad movie at all. Not the best, but not bad...I give it a 6.5. If you watched the original Anime, do not watch this as you will not like it. If you have not watched the original Anime, then watch it since you you can rate it as a standalone movie.

mournblade-56441,Great little movie,10/10,04-Nov-17,"If you haven't seen the animated version, which, like people who have ""read the novel"" etc, makes you hate any other attempt on principle then I really think you'll like this. Interesting premise (which is basically the 'monkey's paw' style mythology). Acting is good, production is good - given the drivel that's being churned out these days I think this is a surprisingly entertaining movie. Don't pay attention to negative reviews based on prejudiced fans of the original, if, like me, you've never heard of it or seen it this movie will be a pleasant experience with an interesting twist and sting in the tail.

ksmail-1,Great movie,08/10,12-Sep-17,"I saw this movie with expectations of a very typical Hollywood formula movie. Despite the beginning being a bit odd and (unintentionally?) humorous, the rest of the movie was engaging, intriguing, and unique. Having watched literally 2000+ movies, I really enjoyed the unpredictability of the story and not knowing where it was leading. The pacing was great and kept me engaged. L was a very entertaining character as well.All in all I really enjoyed this movie and I would surely see it again.PS, I have never seen any of the original anime, and I've seen a lot of people complain that they changed the story and characters etc, but honestly these people rating the movie 1/10 for this reason just seem pathetic.

huntjoshi,worst portray of characters,01/10,27-Aug-17,All the portrays are different from the anime version like the seen where ryuk meets light In anime light was already expecting him and was a smart person from beginning and the portraying of light is not satisfying I lost interest in the movies in the first few minutes only somehow I managed to complete it but it's a shear waste of time

kamenhaven,"This Death Note is a ""page-Turner"", see what I did there?",08/10,26-Aug-17,"I suspect that many who disliked this film are probably die-hard fans of the original Japanese Death Note. I do not consider myself to be in that camp. What I do consider myself to be is a fan of remakes that actually offer a smart and refreshing take on an existing property, not copying and pasting the same exact story beats, character types and plot points of the original, something that Force Awakens (which isn't even a remake!) is shamelessly guilty of. I'm also a fan of films with police procedurals and crime investigations. As such, I was endlessly entertained by Adam Wingard's adaptation of Death Note, a film that combines both the high concept premise of the original with an engaging crime procedural element. It doesn't dig deep, but its incredibly stylish and kinetic energy (from music choices to editing style) will entertain most while also offering several surprisingly new twists on a premise that's familiar to many who have read or seen the manga/ anime.The biggest selling point of the film however, is Lakeith Stanfield's outstanding performance as the fan-favorite Death Note character L. He had already established himself as an incredible talent in films like Short Term 12 and Get Out, and this film is no exception. Lakeith manages to evoke all the cool quirks and mannerisms of L in a subdued and natural way, where else lesser actors would have come off over-the-top or trying too hard. There's even hint at a John-Wick style world-building aspect of his backstory that I hope will be explored in a sequel. I also appreciated the casting of Lakeith as L because it proves that racially diverse casting decisions allows a great talent like Lakeith to elevate an already awesome character regardless of race and skin color.Speaking of which, many white-washing accusations have been made against this film for taking a Japanese property and transplanting it to a Western setting. I'm here to say that these accusations are completely unwarranted because the story takes place in America, and our main characters are Americans played by Caucasian actors, not Japanese people played by white people. One issue most ppl seem to hone into is the fact that lead character Light uses the name Kira but if you've watched the film you'll know that it is both simultaneously a plot point used by Light to divert authorities and also Adam Wingard's attempt to respectful homage the remake's Japanese origins. If Death Note is accused of whitewashing then you might as well accuse Oscar Winning Film The Departed for whitewashing as it is a remake of a Hong Kong film set in America. As far as remakes go, this was different enough that it deserves more credit for trying something new. Being familiar with the original I was still surprised by the new twists and turns in the story as well as the new ending. Fans of Adam Wingard's other films should be delighted that he doesn't skim on the gore and violence either whenever the Death Note executes its victims. All that, combined with it's stylish energy and propulsive pace, makes this remake one that deserves to be given a chance."
daemonwhitey,"This is how many of the fans feel, but I can see why some people liked it",02/10,28-Aug-17,"Real Quick: Everyone who says that they are sick of anime fan boys and girls hating this movie only feel they have a right to because the original content was anime. But many of us have had a movie that we grew up with and really loved that eventually got a remake that was god awful, or just simply lackluster compared to the original content. This is the same for those of us who love the anime. Actual Review: I am a huge fan of the original content. It is my absolute favorite TV show ever. Now that that's clear, I must say I never expected this movie to be a replica of the original series. I'm not sure I even wanted that. I mainly wanted a movie that would show other who would never consider watching the anime simply because it's anime, the beauty of the story of Death Note. You see there's many of different ways they could've taken this movie that would have still been true to the original content while differing. The key elements that make Death Note phenomenal are the battles of wits, the psychological games, the intellectual conversations, and the unpredictable characters. This movie lacked all of that. Every aspect that took any thought was sucked form this movie leaving the audience with the same action/ drama garbage that has such a strong presence in the movie industry today. The uniqueness was really just thrown in a pile of manure and set on fire making it predictable, boring, and what we've already seen thousands of times before. Now for the reason I granted two stars instead of one and also insisting that there should be an option for negative numbers when voting. This is simply because I can see, that from an outsiders view (someone who has never tasted anything better than the predictable action/drama garbage so prevalent in the American movie industry today), how this was actually a decent movie. Had I happened upon this as such a person, I think ""decent"" is the most positive word I would be able to use to describe this movie as even without taking the original content into account, this movie is mediocre at best. the writing isn't terrible, but it's really not great either. The actors aren't great, but a few performances (such as L and Ryuk) made up for the lack of talent found in others.In Short: If you've seen the anime, you can watch it or not, but if you do, you probably won't enjoy it. If you haven't seen the anime, you might like it or even thoroughly enjoy it, but it really doesn't stand out from any other movie I've seen recently so you also might find it rather mediocre."
Dark_Lord_Mark,LIberal Death Note for Social Justice,02/10,15-Jan-18,"Yeah, it is bad. I could forgive almost everything, but to see the ahem....pushing diversity for the sake of it, killed this movie.The acting was bad, the lines were badly written; it was shot very amateurish.And it is all about diversity. Kira has a stupid haircut, stupid blonde dye job, and L, L.....is a black guy.This was a failure. Netflix is pushing identity politics heavily and it destroyed Death Note.It is worse than you can imagine.2 out of 10"
chanchalkumar-37489,5/10 as an independent movie; 3.5/10 in context of the anime,05/10,25-Aug-17,"The original Death Note anime was basically about 2 intelligent people trying to out-wit each other - a perfect introductory series for anyone who wanted to find out why people watch ""cartoony"" animes.The movie, on the other hand, almost entirely skips the intellectual battles between the two lead characters. 'L' (the detective) is reduced to a supporting role while the movie focuses almost exclusively on 'Light' (who possesses the Death Note) and his girlfriend 'Mia' (who is the primary source of twists and drama in the movie). The movie makes significant deviations from the original material (from character personalities to major and minor plot lines) and unfortunately, in this case, ends up feeling like a failed/boring attempt at an ""adventure-like"" movie in contrast to the engaging intelligent drama that was the anime.I just hope that this movie doesn't deter people from picking Death Note as their introductory series when they decide to try watching animes."
darrenbirt,Ignore the fanboys,08/10,12-Oct-18,"If you have never seen the anime and just take the film on its own merits then it's a good watch. Definately for fans of the Final Destination type genre film. I found it very entertaining anyway, for what it's worth and wouldn't have bothered writing a review but for looking at the rating and wondering why it was so low. ..

andrewmartin-95349,Great Movie,08/10,09-Sep-17,"This is the first review I have written on IMDb, because I feel like I needed to clear the air with some of these other reviews. First off, if you've never read or watched the old stuff (which is all the other reviews are complaining about), I can almost guarantee you'll like this movie. I've never seen the original anime, because there's never been an anime I liked, and I loved this movie. It was original, and kept me at the edge of my seat in a way that a cartoon never could have. For all the people bashing it for not being as good as the old stuff, I'd say this: When has a movie adaptation ever lived up to expectations of an original? In my opinion, movies are always better if you aren't comparing them to anything. (Personal example: My favorite Harry Potter movie was Fantastic Beasts because it was the only one I couldn't tear apart compared to a book.) Sure, sometimes the plot seems a little forced, which is why I rated it an 8/10, but overall it was an excellent movie. So, in short, if you've never seen the old stuff, you'll most likely love this movie, and if you have seen the old stuff, you probably disliked my review when you got to the word ""cartoon""."
bonniethebunnyanimaljam,What is this,01/10,05-May-21,I watched this movie and they get 99% wrong as in the end of death more the animation light dies but in this light doesn't he is just in a hospital bed while ryuk is laughing then disappears. They don't add Mello and Near which is important as they have a huge role in the show so wtf is this disappointing.
stermix501,Simply fantastic,10/10,27-Feb-22,"Knowing the existence of Japanese verions, this was my 1st acquaintance with the subject. Watched it in Netflix with serious doubts due to the low rating. But what a rollercoaster that was. No minute of boredom, fantastic direction and acting. Give to the purists their own imdb, or Imdb should give it to them. Catch it in Netlfix now.

Leofwine_draca,Not a patch...,05/10,17-Sep-21,"I thought before watching this American version that it would be hard pressed to beat the two excellent Japanese live action films of the story, and I was right. This is almost unrecognisable. The film loses points for making Light such a clean cut character and giving him a token evil girlfriend, something that screams misogyny to me. Kudos for ramping up the gore with some nasty death scenes, but they don't do much when the rest is such a mess. Some good performances along the way but the whole thing becomes increasingly ridiculous and convoluted as it goes on, ending in tediousness."
stella_debeer,"Yes it wasn't a good adaption, BUT..",06/10,05-Sep-17,"I agree that this movie could've been so much more. If they at least made Light more intelligent and strategic, it might have saved the movie. The intellectual warfare between Light and L is what makes the original Death Note so amazing. BUT some credit has to be given to Lakeith Stanfield for his portrayal of L. He made it his own, but still kept the core characteristics of L. Nate Wolf was also an excellent casting choice, he has the potential to make a good Light, it's just a pity that they dumbed Light down.

colinstening,Not terrible but could've been better,04/10,10-Nov-20,"If watched this movie right after I finished the anime (which is a 10/10 in my opinion) and made the mistake to expect something similar - even though I knew every anime fan dislikes this movie. This movie basically has nothing to do with the original show but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The characters are named a little bit different and the story is a bit different too. If you've watched the anime before you should either expect something like an alternative universe in which a different person is shown or you're gonna hate this movie.Regarding the movie as it's own piece of art I'd say it's not a 1/10 like many people rated it and it's not boring, but there are certainly better movies out there. If you got something to drink and are looking forward for an enjoyable evening with your homies this might be movie you wanna watch but if you want something that will stay in your mind and is objectively better that watch the first two episodes of the anime, it will take about 40 minutes and is enjoyable for non-anime-fans too."
bermudabahama,Lame,01/10,03-Sep-17,"Horrible adaptation of the anime. Nothing will come close to the original incredible anime. This series should not have even been made. Everything about it is horrible and nowhere near what the anime was. I don't know what Netflix was thinking by remaking this in the first place, it was an obvious cash grab based on a highly successful, but still somewhat obscure anime.

qtmeruru,Puke-worthy and absolutely horrible adaptation,01/10,27-Aug-17,"This is my first time feeling the absolute need to write a review on IMDb. I have no idea who's idea it was to make such a cringe adaptation of Death Note. Seriously, who thought this was a good idea? This movie should have never been made, it was awful and a huge insult to the original Death Note. A great psychological thriller converted into a cliché-a-fied teeny bopper American thriller movie. It's even worse than fan-made fanfiction gone wrong. I am disgusted, I hope the people who made this knows what a horrible thing they have done. Absolute trash, please delete it from the face of earth.

drakevader-15474,Fans will write their own names in the Death Note after watching this movie,01/10,27-Aug-17,"For all death note fans, this will be a painful experience. Watching the sorry acting of a scared actor. The lack of complexity and absence of the supremacist feeling of Light. Both the lead actors are pathetic. L should've been quirky but unexpectedly smart. Kira should seem more refined. His dad should be older. I can go on and on about this. But you will have to see it for yourself to understand.I would suggest the fans to stick onto ""Death Note: Another Note: The Los Angeles BB Murder Cases"" and ""Killbook: Shinigami in a Cell"" which are better alternatives

marcelosperger,Bad at best,02/10,25-Aug-17,"Both the manga and the Death Note anime have achieved tremendous success in and out of Japan. Bringing a story full of clever twists and well-constructed characters, the play captures the reader and holds their attention in all volumes and chapters.Light's megalomania sets the tone for the plot and L is an extremely iconic character who has won thousands of fans. By tackling themes and daily dramas, the plot continues to be current even as of 2003.All the good things that the duo Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata built, the newly released Netflix movie manages to ignore.The personality of Kira (Nat Wolff), so striking in the original work, is lost almost completely in adaptation: the character looks like a spoiled teenager and his intelligence, present throughout the plot in the manga, is shown only when it is convenient .Ryuk, played by the brilliant Willem Dafoe, functions almost like a comic relief during the unfolding of the plot, losing part of its somber charm. Mia (Margaret Qualley), the Mass of the adaptation, abandons everything that the character is in the original work to present a shallow and boring personality.L (Keith Stanfield) is another that leaves much to be desired: although they maintain their taste by sitting in chairs of alternative ways and eating many sweets, the character does not have the same intelligence of the original and his manias are never explained, which makes With which the researcher seems silly.Even for those who do not know the original and do not draw the parallels described above, the characters are shallow and their motivations are not enough to sustain their actions in a very similar way; Ryuk becomes even more expendable, L becomes more uninteresting and Light / Kira gives the impression of being much more spoiled.The ""bigger"" rating of the film serves only to justify the amount of blood and death we see on the screen, worthy of one of the sequences of Premonition. Such a battle between good and evil suggested by director Adam Wingard is overshadowed by a story that does not hold up and characters who come together and betray each other without great motivations.The film would be a great addition to the cast of the Afternoon Session if it did not have the gore, as it fulfills very well the role of generic movie ""suspense"" for teenagers."
masonfisk,"KILL ME, I LIKE THIS VERSION BETTER THAN THE ANIME...!",06/10,30-Jul-18,"Based on an anime, this Americanized version fares a bit better than the other J-Horror translations from a few years ago like The Grudge & The Ring but the inclusion of a Japanese character & the killer's Asian nom de plume still rears its ugly head as if American film-goers won't get what's going on. Well cast & directed, this horror fable sets in motion when a tome falls into the hands of a disaffected youth to mete death on all those that he & his newly found & increasingly gung-ho frau feel deserve their brand of grisly justice. With some 80's tunes scattered throughout the score, I kept thinking of the stylish yet empty horror pics of that decade like the First Order & Bad Dreams but this film does have a little meat on its metaphorical bones but not by much.

Pairic,A Book Of Death Insroring Love,07/10,06-Oct-23,"Death Note: Remake of A Japanese film based on a manga comic book series. Light (Nat Wolff) finds a supernatural journal complete with a Demon/Death God Ryuk (Willem Dafoe), all he he has to do is write the names if those he wants to die in the book. Light and his soon to be girlfriend Mia (Margaret Qualley) have had run ins with a school bully, as usual the bully thrives and Light gets detention. Writing the bully's name in the book results in his head being cut in half by a ladder. You would need to have a heart of stone not to laugh at that. Light's mother had been killed by a drunk driver so he takes revenge on him as well. Mia persuades Light to go further, to target despots and evil crooks internationally. He adopts the Name Kira for misdirection and soon has a global death count of 400 having masses of supporters for Lord Kira worldwide. But he now attracts the attention of a strange international detective. This is more savage than the Japanese version with many more gory deaths. The set ups are also more impressive especially the way Light can control his victim's behaviour prior to their deaths. Dafoe is in fine form as the demon cackling away as he imposes arbitrary rules on Light, he looks like a mutant punk hedgehog- human hybrid. Remember yiu can never really trust a Demon. Trust is also an issue between Light and Mia as she wants to go further in choosing victims. The origin story of the detective is also fascinating. Many twists and turns in this tale as the narrative unfolds. Maybe one or two too many for it;s own good with too many writers/cooks spoiling the broth but it's definitely worth watching. Directed by Adam Wingard from a screenplay by Charles Parlapanides, Vlas Parlapanides, and Jeremy Slater. On Netflix. 7/10."
dadinileshrao,Reimagining of the original death note,10/10,26-Aug-17,"The movie is enjoyable, to say the least and with the influx of all pseudo anime based movie haters, the movie is bound to get a bad rep. So I am giving it a 10 even though it deserves like a 7 or 8 to balance the ratings. They changed the storyline to make it possible to stage it in America and it kind of makes sense now.However, the main protagonist was lifeless and L was just plain stupid, so the characters are literally the worst part of this movie combined with the lack of psychological banter which made the anime popular is the worst thing they could have taken out of the movie. However they added more action sequences and made the pace much faster.Its a fun movie give it a watch and don't worry about the haters, they will hate every single anime movie no matter how stupid it is in its original form. Just remember any haters who watched this anime based movie, even Japanese people who make animes haven't been able to make a decent anime based movie, how can you expect a western studio to do the same?"
brooks007,Death Note fans need to remember the live action wasn't made for them.,08/10,25-Sep-23,"This is coming from a person that doesn't frequent on anime but happens to watch a few and Death Note is one of them.I've seen the anime and I loved it. This live action is not as bad as the 1 star reviews you see. The movie is far off from the anime but that's perfectly normal when an anime is made into a live action movie. Most of the characters are nothing like the characters from the anime which is a little disappointing, but like I said, the movie isn't made specifically for the people who saw the anime. (Credit to L as he got anime's L mannerism down to the T)People watching the live action will like it. I've seen comments that say it's fact paced and I agree, but besides that it's a really good movie.

mgamble9,"I liked it better than the anime. Come at me, bro! LOL!",08/10,15-Oct-20,"The anime itself was ok, very good at the beginning but eventually it went downhill as many have noted and I ended up giving it a 7/10 and can't recommend it. The ""I know what you know"" and ""I know you think you know what I know"" got tedious. I had low expectations for the movie and it was probably the right mindset going in. I prefer the Light Turner character to Light Yagami. Yagami was a sociopath and quite boring while Turner had more relatable flaws. I believe the popularity of the anime among young dudes is probably because they they are little edge lords with undeveloped frontal lobes and think that Light Yagami is their role model. LOL! The L character had a much more interesting character arc in the movie while taking the cool personality traits from the anime. The Misa character in the anime was annoying and childish while the Mia character in the movie was way more interesting with a much more believable motive for going psychotic. The anime had more than one Deathnote which seemed a dumb plot twist as there should be only one in the universe to be a proper artifact. The gruesome deaths in the movie also made it much more tense and horrific as it should be since it is about murder via a Death God. The anime had the same problems a lot of these long-winded anime series have in that they run out of ideas and keep flogging a dead horse when the story should be pared down with less characters. The movie was very entertaining and the voice of Willem Dafoe as Ryuk made me smile ear to ear. The effects were very good as well. I'm actually amazed people think the anime is that clever when it is filled with plot holes. The movie has a few as well but overall it was much more enjoyable despite the flaws. I'm hoping this review annoys the Deathnote anime fanboys. LOL!"
funnycommentor,Can't wait for the sequel,09/10,17-Dec-21,"The plot of the movie was so interesting. The acting was so good and the casting was amazing (especially, Light's and Mia's actors). The characters weren't development a lot, however they were so interesting. Also, the chemistry between, Light and Mia was amazingly done. The kills were so brutal and bloody. The storyline was well-written. Overall, the movie was so intense, especially the ending scene, at the ferris wheel. Even though, Ryuk's appearance wasn't well-made, I liked him. In my opinion, it was a really nice movie, fast-paced and action- filled. I totally think it deserves a sequel! Last but not least, the ending scene at the hospital, with Ryuk saying : "" You, people are so interesting"" is ICONIC.

luvlethalwhites_,"Had skipped over it for years, watched it, loved it!",09/10,17-Jun-22,"First of all, I had no idea there was an original anime series out of Japan, so my review is someone who has never watched any earlier versions of ""Death Note.""I had skipped over this for years thinking it was another ridiculous teen horror movie with kids doing stupid things (""let's go hide behind the chainsaws""). Finally decided to give it a go last night, and I was glad I did.It quickly grabbed my attention and kept it throughout. I thought the cast was well done, although the actor chosen for Light's father was a bit odd as he's known more for villainous or @sshole roles, and Light's father is a good cop.I'm not going to give a long wordy review as I'm no movie critic. I'm just someone who loves movies. I often find that some of my favorites are movies that the critics don't like. Likewise, movies that critics love, I scratch my head wondering what drugs they are on.The story is fast-moving so pay attention. If you haven't watched the original series, then there's a good chance you will enjoy this movie, too. It provides an excellent ending."
valleyjohn,Interesting concept poorly executed,06/10,05-Oct-17,"Death Note is following the trend of making films based on Japanese Manga stories. I know absolutely nothing about Manga so coming to this with a fresh pair of eyes is probably a good thing. It's the story of a student , Lite Turner , who comes across a mystical notebook that has the power to kill any person whose name he writes in it. After using the books power he finds himself pursued by a detective known only by the alias L. The first half hour of this film is great. The introduction of the creature Ryuk and the first few deaths had me gripped but sadly it doesn't take too long for it to go downhill. When it starts to introduce the detective and his Japanese counterparts it loses lots of it's appeal. If it had stuck to the horror aspect instead of turning into a detective thriller it would have been much better. While I understand it has to stick to the Manga story to appease the fans it doesn't do this film any favours at all. The actor who plays L , Lakeith Stanfield , looks like he's trying too hard also . The film does ask some interesting questions like whether man should play god and there is no doubt it's entertaining in parts but i feel it could have been so much better."
peterp-450-298716,I'm sure the Japanese version is superior ... but I've never seen it !,05/10,22-Jan-18,"""Relax, Light.
You're asleep and you're dreaming of some eight-foot-tall,demon-looking motherfucker.""The fact one outsmarted Death was the cause of a lot of trouble in ""Final Destination"", resulting in a whole series of victims. Recently I saw ""Wish upon"" with a Chinese music box falling into the hands of a teenage girl. A music box she used to fulfill certain wishes. Only this wasn't without consequences and individuals here also died in gruesome circumstances. ""Death note"" is again a variation on the subject. Here it's the student Light Turner (Nat Wolff) who gets a mysterious notebook thrown into his lap. Whose name is written in it, is doomed to die. And this notebook is accompanied by Ryuk. A kind of hedgehog-like God of death who passes on the notebook if necessary and ensures that the rules described in the booklet are strictly followed by the owner of the book. Light Turner sees an opportunity to rid the world of unwanted criminals. Praiseworthy and noble, but of course not without consequences. Before Light realizes it, the entire police apparatus is behind the mysterious murderer of scumbags from all over the world.Admit it! It sounds promising after reading the storyline. Well, I thought it sounded interesting. An original concept with plenty of possibilities to make it a breathtaking and extremely exciting fantasy story. And actually they largely succeeded in it. Provided you aren't a fervent fan of the Japanese manga this film is based on. After reading a bit about the subject on the worldwide web, I can imagine that this film version feels somewhat limited compared to the original manga. The original story in that manga is being spread out over 108 chapters and bundled in twelve manga booklets. That's why this movie seems so chaotic and the story flashes past you in a rush. In retrospect, it wouldn't be such a bad idea if they had made a series of it. The book ""The Hobbit"" only has about 200 pages and yet Peter Jackson managed to produce roughly eight hours of film to tell this tiny story. If one extrapolates this to this manga, this would probably result in rougly 100 hours of footage.Fortunately I'm a complete nitwit when it comes to Japanese manga and I can judge this film without prejudice. I have amused myself with it. Not only did I find the concept intriguing and at the same time it was frightening how Light has control over someone else's life, simply by putting a name down in a notebook. You can also expect some bloody scenes (""Final destination""-like) when an unfortunate victim dies. I found Nat Wollf convincing enough as the somewhat timid, bullied student who slowly grows into a merciless avenging angel. His girlfriend Mia (Margaret Qualley) has a fairly limited role and didn't impress me so much. Ryuk is by far the most interesting character. It's largely a CGI creation. But thanks to the magnificent voice-over by Willem Dafoe, the entertainment factor of this mythical figure rises swiftly. The most disappointing character was L. (Lakeith Stanfield). A mysterious, young detective who's just a few steps behind Light. But I'll always remember him as the masked dude who maintained a peculiar seating position.For a moment I was playing with the idea to watch the original manga one day. I think there's little chance this will ever happen because I dislike series and Asian-oriented cultural objects aren't quite my sort of thing. But I'm convinced the story will be far better and more intriguing. However, you've never seen the original? No harm done if you'd choose to watch this little treat."
psivampire,"Not bad, but you have to have a certain mindset.",06/10,26-Aug-17,"Many reasons why this movie is getting bad ratings is because of how different it is from the original Death Note manga and anime. If you have seen/read either one of these originals, you can not go see the movie with the mindset that it is Death Note. You have to watch it with the mindset that it is a Death Note Remake, or a Death Note Tribute. The acting was not the best, but for me it did not ruin the movie for me. The basic plot is the same as the original, but the deeper full plot is not the same. A lot of people complain about the movie being ""Whitewashed."" I do not feel this way. There are already Japanese Death Note movies. Nothing wrong with an American based one. We have done the same to movies like The Ring, The Grudge, and The Uninvited. These were never criticized for ""whitewashing.""

amiran-ramishvili,This bleeps,03/10,26-Aug-17,"First of all, non-spoilery parts:* Really, that's Ryuk? Cosplayers do a much better job of it. * Light is a easily manipulated whiny kid. * L is a whiny kid with anger issues.Spoilers: Neither L nor Light possess mental abilities that are even remotely close to their originals.Now let's back that statement up.Light only starts using DN after being prompted by Ryuk. He decides to ""cleanse the world"" at Mia's urging. He does not come up with the plan to remove FBI agents. What kind of Light is that?! They try to salvage his reputation at the end by making him plot the return of the Death Note, but it does a lousy job of it.L never realizes that Kira can control his victims (something he picks on almost immediately in the original). He takes almost two days to guess that Watari has gone to uncover his identity. (more on Watari this later). L does not do much detective work really.. Everything was rushed in this movie, yet they managed to fit in a 10 minute chase-scene, when this time could've been used much more efficiently.Now some factual WTFs:* Watari is not a real name. This might come as a surprise but *gasp* Japanese people have last names.* OK, let's assume Watari is the full name. Why the F did Light not order him to take out L and then die? That seems to be valid in this universe.* ""if she takes notebook she dies"" is not a valid statement. It's a Death Note, not a freaking programming language.* ""..when she falls she will accidentally rip a page from Death Note, that will eventually burn"" is not a valid statement eitherThat's it for now, I'll think up more later."

MonicaBortolotto,A Movie To Be Forgotten,01/10,26-Aug-17,"Everyone called this a white washed adaption with it being set in America (Seattle, Washington) and the casting being diverse (maybe . . .). I found this adaption a disgrace to the source material which included complex and perfectly timed plot planning of Light and his new life goal. This put too much in a movie, hundreds of pages and a whole series (2x) into less than 2 hours. 1. There was no explaining of the situation, no depth to Ryuk being on earth, purpose of the book and no secrecy with this Light immediately sharing the book with a classmate. 2. There's a no strategy to the killing. The concept of the Death Note is the idea of killing those who are bad, harmful to society and doing a favor for the world, ""becoming a god"" but controlling others and becoming harmful in a way yourself. Its a psychological thriller with suspense and morals being conflicted. 3. The deaths are gore-y and stupid with him killing someone he recently had issues with, Light is a sociopath with him being smart and a planner. Killing others discretely, anonymously and this adaption turned to slicing heads and accidental stab in the neck . . . If I was the director of this film I would add a voice over to give more detail, Ryuk would not be a shinigami, this is an American adaption right? Shinigami is Japanese folklore and most Americans don't know about them, Ryuk to most Americans looks like a demon or something creepy, they don't see the death concept. Ryuk should have been adapted into a grim reaper, a figure recognizable to an audience. The kill scenes would be more off scene and if needed clever just as the show. Light was meant to be mature, smart beyond his peers, but this character lacks, the American ""version"" should be a sporty, smart kid, some beloved and not suspected versus a kid picked on and not surprisingly acting out. This movie is a shame because I often enjoy Netflix originals and this series is famous for a reason, but guess this will be another movie I'll pretend doesn't exist."
Jithindurden,Death of Deathnote,03/10,13-Nov-17,"Deviation from the original plot and characterizations in an adaptation is not a bad thing, but that doesn't mean you just take away everything good about the source material. Light was a character who was always sure of himself, brilliant, handsome and never succumbing to anyone. L was a character who was the most brilliant and weird detective who is rarely wrong and doesn't blink in the face of death. Those iconic characters have been turned into whiny teenagers who are unsure of their actions without real purpose. Deathnote was always about the brilliant cat and mouse mind games and the philosophical ramifications of the act of killing. But none of them seems to exist in this film. One of the few things that I hoped to work here was Willem Dafoe as Ryuk. He is great where he can perform with his voice, although Ryuk barely gets any room in the film. They got an actor who can be the best thing as Ryuk and they don't give that character enough screen time and gave a stupid CGI look. The CGI used for Ryuk in the Japanese live-action adaptation of Deathnote released more than a decade ago was much better. The visual and music choices were interesting but that itself shows how far away from the source material they are."
emiel1234,Shame! Ruined the original!,01/10,17-Feb-19,"Both main actors casted were of poor choice. Terrible acting! The original Manga version was brilliant. I can never understand Hollywood's incessant need to remake and ruin an original script.

juliankennedy23,Final Destination with a William Defoe demon.,08/10,07-Dec-18,"Death Note: 8 out of 10: Famous 37 episode Japanese Anime that everyone loves gets converted to an hour and a half movie that takes place in Seattle. Yeah, that is going to go over well.There were three main complaints about Death Note pretty much at the time it was announced. They changed it so it isn't good anymore (Mostly around the character of Light), you can not tell a 37 episode story in an hour and a half (the Dark Tower complaint), and this is yet another example of whitewashing (the Scarlett Johansson/The Ghost in the Shell complaint).The whitewashing complaint is a bit off for what is in actuality an adaptation of the Magna. But honestly, the Ghost in the Shell complaints already took that silliness to eleven. I recently watched the Ghost in the Shell anime and, strange as it may seem, the character of Major really does look a lot like Scarlett Johansson. It is as if the people complaining had not even seen the Anime they were supposedly defending.The Good: Strangely enough the only bit of actual whitewashing in Death Note comes from William Defoe who, I am certain now, was born to play a Shinigami (Japanese Death spirit). He has a more aggressive role than in the anime (Due to the protagonist Light being more passive) but director Adam Wingard wisely keeps him in the shadows. Which honestly is good advice no matter what role William Defoe is playing. Would have done wonders for Body of Evidence.The other winner of most improved character over the anime is Margaret Qualley as Light's girlfriend. Channeling Kristen Stewart to such a degree that wives were hiding their husbands, Qualley is easily the second best thing in this adaptation. Her character is so much more interesting than her Anime counterpart that there is speculation she is an all-new creation despite sharing a similar name.Also, say what you want, this is a handsome production with good special effects and a nice supporting cast. It also has a nice Final Destination vibe that adds to the fun in a way the Anime sometimes could not.The Bad: The following is true: by the end of the first episode of Death Note, which is all of twenty minutes, Light has declared himself a God. The anime actually moves faster than the film. But, like the Scarlett Johanssen kerfuffle above, people's perception is different than the reality. People are claiming that the movie is moving way to fast for the material. Who is right? Everyone it turns out.While the movie may not, at least initially, move faster through the plot than the anime it certainly feels like it does. It is not something that can easily be put into words but the plot feels much faster.Part of this is due to the change of the main protagonist Light. In the Japanese anime, he was a jock and an assertive guy who used woman and glad-handed with adults. In the American version, he is scared to talk to girls and gets beat up a lot. So for the American version to get to the ""I am a God"" you have a lot more ground to travel. Invariably this causes the film to feel rushed even though it is covering the same time period.Light's antagonist L suffers the same fate in a way. We never take the time to see him solve small deductions so he comes across more as someone who read through the entire script rather than someone who is figuring things out based on evidence.The film does seem to skip some of the show your work that it needed to establish these characters. Honestly, it simply is too short and too faced paced. It needed to be longer and take its time so one event felt more like a natural outcome from another event.
The Ugly: A homecoming dance really? I have chosen on purpose to not mention one of the weirdest and worst soundtracks in recent memory. I am of the opinion it was done on purpose. For what purpose eighties power ballads were ringing in my ear I am unsure but there must have been a purpose that I am unaware of. Nobody highlights the most emotional moment of one's film with Chicago's ""I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love"" unless there is a secret underlying meaning or perhaps a hostage situation.
In Conclusion: This is nowhere near as bad as some people made it out to be. Final Destination with a William Defoe demon? Sign me up! I wish it was about half an hour longer to help with pacing issues. This might be a Netflix corporate thing since the also cut the recent Outlaw/King about half an hour it really could have used. Overall a glossy fun picture."
tarikeloukili,what the hell,01/10,25-Aug-17,what the hell is that . the worst thing that i ever seen . the plot is full of holes . we couldn't see the brilliance of light and L . the rival between them . i wish i saw kira plotting . i didn't feel that L was L . mia was more kira than light himself . i don't know what i did just watch . how he get the name kirra was stuped . the intro of L was catastrophic . all the special things about death note are gone ... i wish they didn't turn it to Hollywood movie .
amine_chergui,What a waste of great source material!,01/10,25-Aug-17,"This is what happens when people making a movie are not true fans of the original work. If you haven't seen the original story, then start by reading the 13 volumes of the manga. You won't regret it, i can guaranty that. You will realize how badly : - The main character, Raito, is depicted here as a normal teenager with just higher grades than the rest. We don't see any of the terrifying brilliance of the character in the manga. - They tried to condensate 5 volumes of the story in this movie and they did it in a very clumsy rushed manner - They could have reused the soundtrack of the anime, the one in this movie is unnoticeable. Again I strongly suggest to skip the movie and just read the manga, one of the best in the history of manga.

lauralychee,Awful,01/10,26-Aug-17,"I decided to rewrite my review, giving the movie another chance. The original Death Note manga and anime was just phenomenal, but this movie just didn't do it justice. People who only have seen this movie and nothing else from Death Note, just do not see why fans were so disappointed at this movie. This movie is like taking a masterpiece, and butchering the hell out it. Some people do like the changes, and I'm not discounting their opinions. Like what you like. I personally found it disappointing, but everyone has their opinions.I just found that every teenage character in the movie is just surging with hormones, acting brashly, and too emotional. They just want to do it with each other, then they bicker whine. How are they smart enough to get away with killing people and not get caught? That's not even me comparing it to the original.

diasent,A thoughtful story revised by people with the collective IQ of a soap dish.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"If you have any kind of reasoning skills, or you loved the characters in the Japanese live action or the anime, you will not enjoy this movie. Light Turner(Yagami in the anime) is a genius who stumbles upon a death note and the story becomes a cat and mouse game between L and Light. This isn't the case. L draws conclusions from vague if not completely disassociated scenarios and instantly finds out that Light is Kira and Light simply admits it to L upon their first encounter. This makes the whole movie feel like another cash grab on a fan base. If they are going to be uninspired, they have a script right in front of them that is written by better people. They actually did more work than what you really needed to do. I understand the need to condense the story for run time, but it could be done better. For instance, they could have lifted the prisoner scene from the anime to find out the location. Ryuk dropped the death note in the world because he was bored, he didn't have to find an owner in it and having Ryuk write the names of the FBI agents for Light actually destroyed the movie for me.If Netflix wants to buy properties, they should at least try to make some kind of attempt at keeping true to the story. From this sentence, I will refuse to acknowledge the existence of this movie."
rngfarrell,Forget the original and give this a chance based on its own merits.,07/10,25-Aug-17,"I'm probably going to get strung up by my fellow anime fans for saying this, but I thought that this was an interesting and well- done adaptation, with adaptation being the key word here. There are many, many differences from the original story. Too many to list, in fact. if you hate that idea then you probably won't like this movie. They basically took the concept and wrote the script as if this happened in the US, where values and culture are nothing like Japan's. What becomes apparent is that the changes are necessary for the film to make sense. Regarding its internal story, disregarding any meta-knowledge one may have of the original, I felt that the movie really stands up on its own. We still see the same themes explored, the acting ranges from fine to superb and the cinematography can't be faulted. While there is an element of teen romance, I found that the movie avoided the pitfalls of this overused trope by relegating it to a sub-plot. As for the God of Death, I really enjoyed the dark, sinister look that the character was given as it matched his newer, darker personality. Willem Dafoe was born to be Ryuk, so much so that I continuously forgot that I was listening to Dafoe and not an actual Shinigami (on a side note, one of the only things I missed from this film was the use of the term 'Shinigami' to describe a God of Death, although they did have a brief little nod to original portrayal of Ryuk). Keith Stanfield was incredible as L - he captured the mannerisms perfectly, something I didn't actually think was possible - and even though the character strays from the source material, it makes sense within this movie's narrative.Forget the original and give this a chance based on its own merits. It is a well-made film that does a great job adapting and squeezing the lengthy Japanese source material into a standard Hollywood- format, while also managing to keep it believable to a general western audience. It is clear that the intention was never to imitate the original, but to take inspiration from it, and on this (death) note I believe it succeeds."
frerub,This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Birdemic was better,01/10,26-Aug-17,"Delete this garbage from existence. Worst movie I've ever seen in my life. What were you thinking when making this? How to trigger long term fans of what was an amazing manga/anime? Jesus Christ what a farce. Anyone reading this before watching it: IT'S NOT WORTH IT. Go watch the original series and never look back.

tero-j-ojala,Interesting and different movie,08/10,03-Sep-17,"This movie demonstrates how biased and vengeful IMDb reviews have become. If movie originates from some cult-fan-based origin, it is guaranteed that it will not get fair reviews.I was tempted to give 10/10 in spite of those horde of totally unfair 1/10 reviews made by fans of Japanese manga. But i choose to give it 8/10 that in my opinion is fair score to this movie, although little too high.I have not seen original manga and because of that, i found this movie interesting and original, there just is not anything like this in American movies. I was little disappointed how little the book were used and deaths showed. The general idea of the ""death note"" could be used far more and there could have been less teen-drama."
iamkiranow,Dumpster Fire,01/10,13-Apr-22,"They turned a battle of wits into a battle of morons. It's one thing to have an adaptation, but you can't take the same exact characters and leave out everything that made them brilliant and interesting. This movie feels like more of a satire of Death Note than an actual attempt at trying to honor the original story. This is what happens when you write ""Death Note"" in the Death Note.

JakeBrinkman,"Not good, but not as awful as all the show's fans are saying",04/10,31-Dec-18,"I have seen both the show and the movie, and I firmly believe that all of the story line changes were necessary to turn the long show into a short film. However, my biggest complaint is that much of the thought processes for both Light and L were cut drastically short or not included at all. I believe the mind games between the two characters was the fundamental reason the show was so enjoyable, and removing that aspect from the movie severely cut the most vital part of the show. I understand it would be difficult to show in a non-anime film style, but a clever writer should be able to work it in just fine.Although many of the story changes are perfectly acceptable for a film adaptation, cutting out the heart and soul of the Death Note show was an unnecessary and poor decision.

aofiara,If I could get rid of one movie on this planet it would be this. Go watch the original instead for an incredible story and plot.,01/10,25-Apr-22,"If I could remove one movie from existence it would 100% without a doubt be this film. The worst thing I have ever seen in my life, I cannot express how deeply I hate it.Nothing bothers me more than knowing a bunch of people wasted millions upon millions of dollars to create such an appalling film that had the potential to be the best movie ever. The story for Death Note (the original story...) is one of my all time favorite stories of any show ever, and I could rewatch the animated version and reread the comics a million times and still be thrilled.But this...it was clearly made by a bunch of people who knew absolutely nothing about the original story and did not include any thoughts or opinions from anyone who was a diehard fan. With remakes of anything, you NEED to have people who are strongly passionate about it on the project-not even just on it, but in charge of it. Just because you have the money to buy the rights to make a remake doesn't mean you should without having any clue about it.Not to mention, having William Dafoe as the voice of Ryuk and to completely and utterly waste that single win with an absolutely garbage plot, characters, dialogue, and wrong actors is extremely disappointing.I understand wanting to have a slightly different angle or direction for a remake, but to an extent. Yes, as an American remake of a Japanese show it makes sense to alter things to fit a different culture. Some things from the Japanese original wouldn't make sense in an American version. For example, some of the names of the characters aren't going to feel realistic in an American version because they are different ethnicities. A white main character is not going to be named Light Yagami. BUT, they changed his name to Light Turner. I mean, come on. Light Turner. They didn't even think about that for more than a second.I agree with changing the name from Light Yagami, but you could have changed it to a completely different American name that still connects to the original name in some way. Turner is just a dumb last name that means nothing and he is still a white guy named Light and who the hell is named Light in America?When it came to the characters, they completely changed their personalities to total opposites. Light, who is supposed to be an absolute mastermind-super intelligent but manipulative and sociopathic-which keeps us super interested in him. That type of personality keeps us on the edge of our seat, waiting to see his next move. But their Light is an absolute and utter idiot. Just straight up dumb and a loser. He also is some kid with bleach blonde dyed hair and the actual actor already had brown hair like the original character to begin with, so why did they make him dye his hair bleach blonde to play Light?I could just go on for a million years about why and how this movie is atrocious. It really doesn't even deserve one star, but I suppose you can give it that for William Dafoe's voice acting. Not that that even matters because it was wasted and Ryuk was also evil in the film, which Ryuk should not be.If you want to see the amazing story and characters of the original Death Note be destroyed and turned into the worst thing you've ever seen then go ahead and watch this movie. It's actually so terrible that it might have been a parody all along."
stevenzaccaria,"Point in Fact, IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!",10/10,25-Aug-17,"I don't understand why people fail at their ability to use logic! Anyone who has written a negative review about this picture has clearly lost that capability.First thing: You have to realize is that you cant compress almost 40 individual episodes of an anime series into an 1 hour & 40 minute movie without making some reasonable compromises, ""look what they did with The lord of the Ring Films for example"". They even had to make drastic cuts to the ""Game of Thrones novels"" to make it work & they made 7 seasons so far & they still aren't done!Second point: You are taking a renowned series that in my opinion is at the ""pinnacle"" of its genre & putting a fresh new spin on it. Lets face it, there would be no point in simply reproducing the same series in live action because it would just be more of the same.Third: There are simply some things that when they are animated or CGI just don't transfer well into live action!!!All that being said I loved it, Everything about it! Whether it was the casting, acting, cinematography, music & most importantly The source Material.All of it was perfectly balanced into an 1 hour & forty minute cinematic experience that I will always treasure. My only regret was that it was not released in theaters because this would have been awesome on the big screen.I hope you like it as much as I did.Thank you."
eli-291-639439,"I love death note,..",02/10,26-Aug-17,"..the Original series of it. The series has a deep meaning, deep story,.. it just makes sense.This Movie however is just absolutely disgusting. The story is just bent and manipulated in a propaganda fashion. It is also filled with illuminati symbolism. It is sad to see how they corrupt nice things and bend them to their agenda. Taking our most loved stories and bending them is a effective method for manipulation and placing poison into your heart. Light turns slowly insane in the Series, while in this movie he looks like a Hero (of mass murder).

foxtografo,Very well made remake,08/10,21-Nov-17,"I believe all the bad reviews are written by the animé series. It's always difficult to see actors playing characters you love so much, most of the times they'll look different, and this only, can upset hardcore fans. Id did happen to me many times with many movies based on characters I love very much, but I always try to bypass this and be objective on the story told and the quality of all the other aspects of the movie.Now, after watching this movie, my opinion is that it's a very well paced movie, not a simple thing to do with such a long series that was the animé. Everything is there. The characters, the same development of events with some twists at the end to not make the movie boring after knowing the animé's ending, so the story aspect of the movie is solid. The actors do the part well, specially ""L"" that obviously did his homework at getting the character's costumes, gestures and postures, just brilliant, even if he physically doesn't look at all like the original. I liked the photography and the general design of how everything looks, I think they did a great job keeping it as faithful as possible but translated to occidental. They also kept it gory, and didn't try to make it watchable for kids at expenses of everyone else.. Overall, I don't have much to criticize about it, besides two moments of the movie where the music was a bit anticlimactic, but that definitely didn't ruined the movie for me. Give it a try, if you're not a hater.Note: After writing this review, I found this on the ""trivia"" section of this website:Despite the backlash on whitewashing, Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata, the original creators of Death Note, have praised and defended the film, with Ohba stating, ""In a good way, it both followed and diverged from the original work so the film can be enjoyed, of course by not only the fans, but also by a much larger and wider audience"".So, believe the hardcore fans or the creators of the original series."

You are all so mad, get over it and go watch your greasy DVD collections. Don't come to the IMDb page and down-rate based on your biased opinions. It's a movie adaptation, there's no reason it should follow the exact plot/time line. With that said, I found the delivery of the lines to be very entertaining and the action very satisfying. If you really find yourselves to be Netflix aficionados, watch the other garbage on there, because, this movie, is a diamond in the rough.I mean, Willem Defoe...

pencive-31711,"No plot spoilers, but let's talk about real-life serial killers in movies for a second...",10/10,06-Sep-17,"The manga and anime of Death Note were so poorly written, I was terrifically relieved when I watched this film. I WOULD NEVER COMPARE THIS MOVIE'S STRENGTH TO THE FAILINGS OF THE OTHER FORMATS. This movie patches plot holes in the other formats you could drive a bus through. I've studied serial killers and social engineering. From the get go, I saw a lot of potential in this series' concept. But it failed me time and again with Clark Kent syndrome.The manga and anime act like everyone in their universe besides Light and L are somehow facsimile of 1940's Lois Lane(glasses, no glasses?). Oh, Kira left evidence that pointed to Light? Oh, no, he doesn't act like a psychopath all the time... oh wait, no, yes he does. And in this movie they actually derive REAL human interactions that could revolve around finding a magic book that has the power to kill with but a word.I'll try not to spoil anything, but to give people a breakdown of what they're getting into and why this is a masterpiece for Netflix movies. I'll go through the characters and maybe others can see what I saw.Light - he's a teenage boy that falls in love with ""the hottest girl in school"". As their relationship grows, he becomes manipulated by several factors. While his intentions start out both righteous, but selfish, he becomes easily manipulated because of his teenage bearing on emotions. Watchers should mostly focus on this movie being an origin story for what he becomes, hero or villain.L - long in his life is he the unchallenged super sleuth, L becomes vulnerable when he finally comes up against a situation he was never trained for. Watari, his butler, is very close to him professionally and emotionally. This is no spoiler, but from L and Watari's introduction, we see Watari earnestly caring for L. Lakeith's portrayal of this super sleuth is masterful. His transition from a coded, stone cold mastermind to someone who's as human as anyone else sells the idea that what happens in the film at least matters to someone.The music - It's amazing. It's poignant. It's 80's. There have been a lot of skeptics about the tracks, but they are one of the most highly valuable points of this film. Don't believe me? Compare this with Fan4stic's soundtrack that ruined the film (literally. they could dub fan4 with the LOTR audio track and it would win awards). It DEFINITELY fits the vibe of the world the film crew builds.Loki - I mean, Willem Dafoe, I mean, Ryuk - Ryuk is the honey badger. Look it up if you don't get the reference. As a god, every single one of his actions make sense by the time he has his last line.The girlfriend - Yes, she has a name: Margaret Qualley. And I strongly recommend reading essays on what a goth, underage sex-object her character is in the manga and anime's. Seriously, it's pathetic what her character was. She wasn't even human, because her personality doesn't exist in the fabric of possible combinations of human interactions and influence. And while some may argue this is semantics, it's painfully obvious this character transformed from the misogynistic Japanese sex culture into what this movie poses: a real young women with good looks who has power handed to her by society because of their value of her as a sex object. And I can't tell you how happy I was seeing how well this character was written. Not only is Qualley fantastic but her struggle dealing with someone who actually values her(Light) and won't outright hand her power, becomes her greatest descriptive quality. At first I expected her to be a disposable foil, like she was in the manga. But that character, the goth-child-sex-object, had a personality that was a piece of crap from the beginning. And the writer kept her around to show off what he could do with something that everyone thought of as an anti-hero. Except she wasn't, she was just poorly written. Again, this movie fixes that in awesome fashion.If you're a fan, please realize that psychopathic behavior is now easily spotted by ""haystacking"" internet use data, and behavioral queues related to affect. The movie points to some of the AMAZING hard science of the detective industry surrounding American, white terrorist activity. L even points it out to Light's dad, just, like, so many times.And if you're coming in fresh: this is a horror movie. It's dolled up like a teenage coming of age story. But the reality of the takeaway is what we all experienced: you may find gods as you grow up, but you'll know you've grown up when you realize how powerless you are in their games. And better than the revelation of the end of a coming of age story, you see the character ponder whether they were ever evil, evil all along, or only evil because of the influence of others."
aastikhimta,Not that bad,05/10,05-Jul-21,"Firstly there were some connections from original Death note but the main thing is the plot was different actually and the concept of death note was different too. Ending was lame though.

fezaum10,Why would they do that? 20 minutes was enough,01/10,25-Aug-17,"My first review here. I never expected to do this but death note live action was so bad that driven me to it. (english is not my mother tongue I apologize) When I first knew about this live action I was sure it would be bad, seeing the trailers just confirmed that. Today at the release I decided to keep an open mind. I thought: How bad can it be? Actually I don't mind it's different the anime is already there...Well, it's not different. it's just BAD!My breaking point was at 20 minutes long, I just couldn't watch it anymore I could go hours listing things that disgusted me but there is one thing that I just can't understand: How can they destroy a character that's already been made? Just copy and paste. They don't need to be geniuses. They don't need to create anything! It's there! Just use the source.The one thing that made me mad above all was that Light personality was ruined. they reduced him to a bullied looser cliché. Accutually everything that happened in those 20 minutes was a cliché.(SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!)The movie presents him as a troubled bullied teenager that cheat on school for money and try to defend his crush from a bully and gets beaten. What does he do? He kills the kid with the death note... As if it's not enough he was coerced to it. the whole darkness of the character the brilliance the ideology that made him Light isn't there. He's just some kid coerced by a monster into killing...Among other things why appeal to the gore? it seems cheesy, there was no need for that. A dark story isn't made from guts all over the floor...(SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!)The Breaking point was when he shows the death note to his crush and kills a guy in front of her. To me the nearly unwatchable became unwatchable."
zoudarren,Pure Bad.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"A disgrace to the premise of Death Note. And if you argue that this isn't supposed to be Death note then why use the title? They are milking the title and the sadist thing is that when you Google ""Death Note"" this garbage pops up as the first result. If they named it something different and simply added credits to acknowledge Death Note's usage it would be fine since they will attract their targetted audience of kids who enjoy these cringe-worthy romance dramas but instead the people who actually enjoyed Death Note for what it is will inevitably leave a bad review because you attracted them to something they were not expecting with a misleading title.

SilverOrlov,Typical American style,03/10,11-Oct-17,"I never liked the film adaptation, but this surpassed all the others, from what I've seen. A typical American representation of stereotypes. Special spitting in the original - black L.Tried even to judge simply as an independent film, rather than adaptation, but the impression is higher than from some third-rate thriller never happened."
Aly200,The Anime is Far Superior,05/10,16-Nov-17,"Oh so much potential that was such a letdown for fans of the acclaimed manga and anime series. Adam Wingard who brought us ""Blair Witch"" and ""You're Next"" took directing duties for this Netflix original film based on the anime of the same name. Unfortunately the finished product didn't deliver many of the promises that made its trailer look good or even live up to the acclaimed anime that preceded it.The film's casting is definitely one of the biggest issues that has rightly earned massive backlash: 1. Nat Wolff is woefully miscast as Light Turner, the film's antihero, as he lacks any charisma that makes Light's transformation into a psychopath so engaging like the series. Wolff comes as an emo kid who just plods along and is cowardly unlike his fearless anime counterpart. The character is also more like a pawn who is goaded easily by the others around especially his sociopathic girlfriend, Mia (Margaret Qualley), and the demon, Ryuk. Whenever Wolff's Light tries to come across as serious, the actor comes off more as a caricature of a kid trying too hard to be cool. 2. Lakeith Stanfield as the clever detective L is a horrible representation of the layered and complex character from the manga and anime series. The character comes cowardly like Light and also as just being lucky rather than being a mysterious intellectual who arouses Light's fear of being discovered as the mysterious enigma 'Kira'. L's ineptitude grates on the nerves of the viewer and Stanfield's lack of complexity reduces the impact that L has on the narrative. 3. Margaret Qualley as Mia Sutton is another misrepresentation as she is made to be the sadistic mastermind of Light's reign of terror whereas in the anime she is a pawn of Light's plan. Mia is a stereotypical cheerleader who falls for brooding loner in this film and is her actions don't come across as believable. The anime character is far more complex as she is disturbed when she realizes that Light is Kira and becomes a victim of his psychopathic nature while Qualley's Mia is purely selfish and unrealistic as she is out for her own gain rather than being an accomplice to Light's actions. Even her exit is bland despite the attempt to come across as tragic, but is more of a relief that a poor character is gone.The film's sole bright spot is the spot-on performance of actors Jason Liles and Willem Dafoe as the demonic entity, Ryuk who created the Death Note. Liles in motion-capture provides the physical presence of the character while the haunting vocals of Dafoe (also motion-captured) bring the character to life. Jason Liles looms large as Ryuk's horrifying presence as he lumbers through the sets and terrifies the wimpy Light which I suppose serves the purpose of his intimidation technique. However the vocal performance by Willem Dafoe surpasses the physical presence of the character as the husky and growling tones of the veteran actor lend the eeriness to bring Ryuk to life. With his trademark cackle and raspy gravitas, the actor imbues Ryuk's evil nature as the puppet master and instigator of the narrative as he constantly threatens to take away his book from Light and do away with the useless boy. Now if only the director had allowed the wicked demon to kill the character as in the anime.The film's script does understand the basics of the story as Light uses the titular Death Note to kill those he pens down on the page. However the writers misunderstand the purpose of why Light uses such evil forces. In the original material, Light originally only kills those who deserve to die but over time begins to develop a sadistic pleasure in playing God and wants to create a new world order where he is the God of the society. In this film, he is just killing for no reason other than to please Mia or at times Ryuk (however the demon bides his time in watching Light lose his humanity rather than influencing the boy). Light's exploits as Kira have less impact than the original material as he doesn't really seem to invoke the concept of playing God. His only real significant kill that shows Light's start to darkness is killing a bully (with encouragement by Ryuk) and then the action sadly falls flat as the story goes on.Stick with the anime if you want a proper treatment of this disturbing story."
ten-thousand-marbles,A decent horror fantasy,06/10,16-Dec-20,"I'm not familiar with the animated series so I took the movie at face value. I found it mostly entertaining. The story and script were weak at points, but I found those things forgivable. It had a good pace to it, production was solid and it was suspenseful. The ending left some things open, I assume for the hopes of a sequel. It was better than I expected going in and is worth a watch.

syunshin,It's horrible if you ever seen the original comic,04/10,10-Oct-17,"the main characters are totally broken by this movie! I meant, this garbage film cannot get any stars from readers of DeathNote. if you didn't read the original comic, it might have four stars. although it is a poor young adult movie, the final tricks Light use are not so bad.but, it's no need to waste time on this movie.

faytheboom,Awful,01/10,17-Sep-19,"If only zero stars were possible. Even if you never watched or heard of the original death note this movie is awful. The depth of the original series is trivialized in this remake.
None of the original characters are portrayed remotely well. If you wanna make a remake with different characters than don't pretend they are the same.
Honestly the Japanese live action remake of death note was terrible. However, compared to this massacre it is amazing. Don't waste your time.

Kevin0202,Why i liked this movie,08/10,27-Jun-20,"Well, before I begin, I am going to say that this review will be very detailed, since many people do not like it. I will clarify a lot the things that they did well and badly.THE GOOD
Well the movie starts with a good rhythm, some very good shots accompanied by very well-made music since we noticed 2 different people from the rest just by watching it.
The rapid arrival of the notebook (Death Note) was very good since it made it much faster and not dense the plot. Very good appearance of Ryuk and his design with ""very well done plans"".
You get hooked very easily to the movie since the action begins at the beginning, it is very interesting with many funny horror scenes and the best action scenes with very good deaths except one and the plot is very well done.
The appearance of L is very well accomplished. And each time the movie progresses, you realize how Mia is gradually taking over the Death Note without Ligth Turner noticing, but at the same time you are realizing the intelligence and subtlety of Ligth but at the same time also Mia's intelligence.
I loved how they show how the Death Note radically changed Mia and Light, always attentive at every step I take.
Very well achieved the aspect of despair of L to see that Watari disappears, and the way in which Mia did everything to be able to acquire the Death Note was very ingenious and very well thought out, do not expect it, you think he was going to do something very opposite .
Also noteworthy are the performances by Margaret Qualley (Mia) and Nat Wolff (Light).
The director Adam Wingard thought the story very well since the move of Light so that Mia does not take over the Death Note is masterful with very good shots of the roulette at the end with the death of Mia that is very well accomplished and the end is very good.THE BAD
The script is very fast, you do not feel that it is 100% real. When Light the one struck by the brabucon all their sheets are wet and when he is with the director they show the sheets and they are completely intact, not even a little wrinkled, it is not such a serious mistake but it is still a mistake.
When you meet Ryuk, Nat Wolff's performance is very bad and the place is not the best we can say ...
Death by beheading is unpleasant as they did it seems like a very bad death of final destination. There is a part that is supposed to be comedy but instead of laughing it gives you cringe.
The plot is so fast that almost nothing is developed, the only characters that developed very little were Light and L.
Previously I said that you realize the good intelligence that Light has but the truth is that in one part it disgusts how they treated that because you can see that something is happening that is very easy to realize and does not seem to me seems to be a mockery of the character.Conclusion: Many people did not like this movie since it is not the same as anime but I do not bother with anything that is like that, on the contrary I like to be treated differently (many people will not agree with this score but they are my tastes hahaha)"
qomsol,Stupid and rushed version of the story. Don't bother.,02/10,30-Aug-17,"There is 2 good things about this awful garbage pile - Willem Dafoe's awesome voice (in fact I think his voice is perfect for the part) and the guy that plays L is actually not bad. That's it. The rest is just terrible. And that is why I rated it 2 stars. The motivation of characters is thin to say the least. Everyone arrives at conclusions and performs actions without clues or reasons. The ending of course is foolish and cheesy starting with the insane scene that is supposed to be the movie's climax I guess and followed by Light suddenly showing signs of genius planning abilities in the lst 5 minutes of the film.The following is a bunch of spoilers in a form of ""Cinema Sins"": 1. Light is a wimp and a typical dumb teenager controlled by testosterone. Just look at the original Light - gathered, disciplined and borderline genius. 2. Mia touches the DN but doesn't see the Shinigami? Why change this? It makes no sense and difference for that matter. 3. [""Kira"" means ""light"" in Russian]. Ahahahaha! Ahahaha, no it doesn't! What? No! No it doesn't! You just pulled that out of your... ahem, behind for no reason. At the most it's: 1) Ancient Greek for ""master"" 2) Persian king name that means ""like the sun"" 3) Or a Hindu ""ray of light"". None of those are Russian as you may see and in 30 years of living in Russia never once have I heard this. 4. L creates a mess around himself and freaks out here while the original one kept organizing stuff and always remained scary calm. 5. L comes out and calls Kira a coward and nothing else, including not threatening him in any way, while keeping his name and face concealed. Yet later he concludes that him not being killed there and then confirms his idea that Kira needs a name and a face. 5. L accuses Light out of nowhere and Light basically spills the beans. 6. For whatever reason Watari obeys Kira over the phone. DN has no such power and it's never mentioned or explained. 7. L gets a search warrant for Light's house... on what grounds exactly? 8. Mia doesn't own the book but her writing in it actually works. Again I remind you that she didn't even see the Shinigami when she touched it, but somehow she's able to wield the power of the DN. 9. Light doesn't read what's written across a quarter of a blank page. 10. Light doesn't immediately write Mia's name in the book after she confessed to writing his name to get the book. And why would she bother to wait and blackmail Light if she could just get the book by killing him? 11. Actor playing L is pretty good but he visibly slips twice during the chase scene and those bad takes don't get re-shot. Sigh."
tecnababe,Only watch if you haven't watched or read Death Note.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"This is not a good movie, but not a bad movie on it's own. If this wasn't an adaptation, it would get a solid 5-6/10. But it is and it's a sad one too. The reason it's so sad is the butchering of all characters. Light is still smart but that's all left of him. Mia's only common trait with Misa is that they're both Light's partner. L starts kind of accurate but then his personality shifts into something much different than the original. Light's father and Watari behave inaccurately too but the worst and the saddest one in my opinion is Ryuk. The only character that's so hard to mess up -especially with that voice actor- is somehow messed up so badly that he's unrecognizable. I'm not saying visually - though he looks rather bad- but his behaviors. I wish they only got inspired from the manga, then wrote completely new characters and plot, a new shinigami and made something new. Because it's so in between that it's sad. So if you have enjoyed Death Note before, there's no need to waste your time. If you haven't, you can watch this, enjoy it a bit, then go enjoy the actual thing more.

simplyshalee,Not many good qualities,03/10,26-Aug-17,"I am a massive fan of the anime series Death Note. This movie fails to capture the intellectual wit and psychological complexity of the anime. Light is a completely different character, lacking the charm, arrogance and cool, calm collectedness that made Light such a grey character. He is a bit of a punce in the film. Sometimes it comes across as if they have tried to use 2 people (light and Mia) to portray the complexity of one (light in the anime). Mia displays more sadistic, cocktail behaviour and wears the pants in the dynamic, making the tough calls. The portrayal of L at the beginning I thought was solid, but as he started to unravel and become frazzled it kind of took it away from me. In saying that L was probably the best character. Also Ryuk was used as a creeper in the background and had no real development which is a shame because he looked awesome and had a lot of potential. The story itself is not really the psychological thriller of the original, it's more like an angst teen romantic action film. If that's your kind of thing then maybe you will like this film. It gets 3 stars because of L, Watari and Ryuk, one star for each. I wish it was better and I tried to like it, but there were too many character and plot issues."
shadowasian,Same first name but different last name,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I don't know why but they keep the first name as the same but change the last name. It is pointless to do this. They could just change all the name all together. Anyone can be kira or L but using the same name like ""Light"" meaning that they don't understand the true story of using the death note. Death Note can be past from person to person and that person can be Kira. You can tell that the team who make that movie doesn't read anything about death not and just use the same first name all over the movie.

johnspringer-95440,An Odd Mix of Tones,05/10,15-May-23,"I've never read the source material so I can't comment on this adaptation's fidelity to it. From an uninformed casual viewer perspective I thought this was just okay.The main premise is excellent: what would a flawed but essentially well-meaning person do with the power to mete out death with impunity? This a weighty question that implicates dark themes; parts of this movie seem to be giving it serious exploration. And then there's the remainder of the movie which plays out like goofy teen scream, where the supernatural-afflicted protagonist is distracted by bullies, popularity cliques, young love and parental tensions. It's odd and incongruent and it creates an unsatisfying tonal inconsistency throughout.

moseshlimpuia,Just bad!!,03/10,05-Sep-22,"The only thing worth mentioning is LaKeith Stanfield acting because he actually tries. All the other characters are just so bad. I'm not even sure the actor for Light did one bit of research on his character. The anime version of Light is confident, smart, perfectionist and would never fall for stupid love trap. However, it's complete opposite in this movie. The plot is super rushed and disappointing because it actually has a bit of potential. Ryuk has less than 5 minutes of screen time, guess they don't have the budget for that although which is unlikely. It seems Hollywood only cares about popular anime remakes for quick money grab because I haven't watched one good life action done by them. Disappointing as usual.

scb_coldsteel,The death of Death Note,02/10,02-Oct-18,"Finished the new Netflix movie Death Note. I'm a fan of the anime, so I had high hopes for the adaptation. With Willem Dafoe playing the god of death and a backing from Netflix what could possibly go wrong? Apparently near everything!The biggest problem this film is a fundamental lack of understanding of the source material. It is as if the director borrowed the name of the characters but beyond that nothing else. I'm fine changing the story around, but this didn't feel like Death Note at all. It had far more in common with a final destination movie than anything else. The out-of-place extreme gore just felt cheap. Speaking of the story this movie was a complete mess. It had a strong opening, but fell apart in a nonsensical mess. This of course being a complete shame considering the complexity of the Death Note anime. The dialogue was also laughably bad at times. I won't even begin to talk about the slap together ending. The whole movie was lazy writing all around.Speaking of lazy Jesus the acting in this movie. The guy playing Light Yagami is a absolute joke. He cannot emote whatsoever! Every action feels like a characterture of an emotion. Every other character seems to be sleepwalking through their role. I had high hopes for L, but they somehow even managed to dumb down that character.The one redeeming quality being the CGI. Ryuk looked great. And of course I have to mention Willem Dafoe was a perfect voice. He absolutely killed the role. He was the perfect mix of menacing and hilarious. I want them to redub the anime with his voice.All together this movie is a perfect example of how anime adaptations fail. Why make unnecessary changes when the plot and dialogue of the Death Note anime are near perfect? Why dumb down he material? Why make lazy and cheap decisions that ruin the film? Overall a terrible movie."
TrygveB,Huge downgrade on the anime,03/10,26-Aug-17,"I don't often write reviews, but after having waited in anticipation for the movie- adaption of one of my all time favorite anime's, and being delivered what I can only call a disaster, I had to make one.As other reviewers has noted, this may be a decent movie if you have not seen the anime, but if you are one of the ones that have watched the anime, you will get thoroughly disappointed by the acting, story and mood set in this film.Not only has everything been Americanized with Light the main character being made out to be a victim of bullying and Mia being a cheerleader, but the acting is just not good enough. I also feel that a lot of the buildup in the start is missing, but that is half-expected because of the reduction in the amount of screen-time. But there is just too much missing of importance later on in the movie. They should've made this movie into two or three movies, or just not made it at all."
udaiveer-51944,Just Forget About Watching it.,02/10,26-Aug-17,"don't waste your time on this.its full of waste. first, they messed up the whole story and the characters and the writers did the worst job. the whole story just waste. compared to the original anime it's crap. it is a black spot on death note. believe me, you will regret after you watch this waste. watch the original anime instead. Netflix did a fantastic job in messing up a wonderful story."
amalez,"Gory and very realistic CGI, pretty cool film",10/10,24-Jan-19,"It's was actually a good movie. The beginning was kinda of slow but expected. I'd watch the movie again just to see the visual effects. Such realistic death scenes, very gory and pretty cool. You can tell a lot of effort was put into making this film. As well as all the twists and turns, they're well thought out and all make sense. People are offended by the main character being white, but it is an American remake, they could've chosen a Japanese American but idk.

philxtian,I'm really disappointed,04/10,25-Aug-17,"I wish they've created a series instead. Both L and Light have interesting characters and the original story is really awesome. Unfortunately, I didn't see much of that in the movie. I still like how the Japanese anime and movie did it. Netflix just wasted the opportunity. There's so much they can do with the story. There are still other good characters in the original story which they can add later on if it was a series. I thought this is going to be big but I've got disappointed after watching."
arrmeen,This is Adam Wingard's interpretation,08/10,02-Aug-21,"I've been reading some dumb people out here complaining that this movie is not true to the original. Have they even seen the director Adam Wingard's interview, he's clearly said he's a fan of the original but he wanted to blend his own style into this , which he has done and frankly this movie is really well made. With a good cast it doesn't disappoint. Haters take a hike, if you watch it you'll like this one.Don't be a troll.

thaladiieh,Great Adaption!,09/10,27-Aug-17,"I don't know what you guys want, i think it was a great movie! We all knew that it wouldn't be the original story! They made it very clear that it will be the characters + concept, with a new story attached to it. I find that the casting is perfect and they acted it out very well. I loved the Anime and i hated the Japanese Death Noten movie. They tried to make it exactly like the Anime and that was a huge failure in my eyes. I mean, we all know what happened to the Dragonball and the Last Airbender movies.. Compared to those two, Death Note was extraordinary! 8/10

brllz,"Bad writing redeemed by good acting, visuals and soundtrack.",07/10,25-Aug-17,"I would preface this review by saying, this is arguably David Tattersall's greatest achievement as a director of photography to date.This film has been rather roundly f*cked on this website and others for being an unfaithful adaptation of a highly reviewed manga and anime originals. And it is. It's totally unfaithful, in it's second and third acts it's telling a wildly different story to the source text, I'd however argue, the new story it tells is not a bad one.Without ruining the plots deviation from the original it is safe to say, it's been westernized heavily, and as that so often entails, simplified... Which in my opinion is a mistake, much of the ethical complexity of the source text has sadly been lost in favor of a clunky romantic subplot but ah well, it's poor adaptation is almost fully redeemed by a cast who really appear to work together perfectly, the balances of power, standing and chemistry are believable and all the principles put in thoroughly solid and believable performances, I was pleasantly surprised especially by Wolff, who has I think greatly matured as an actor since I last saw his work.Moreover, the film is a visual delight, there is not a single dud shot in the whole thing, honestly, 1 hour 30 minutes total, I was in total awe of just how gorgeous this film looks, it's contrasty, disconcertingly framed and constantly moving, a subtle yet appreciated nod to the anime's style. David Tattersall has outdone himself here.Finally, despite the rating, this film has all the hallmarks of a smashing hit with the under 21 year old audience, the mild nudity, sparing use of profanity and occasionally OTT gore are intertwined with an unexplained (but enjoyable) retro soundtrack (the credit track being a cover of a Celine Dion classic!). The whole film feels like a neon, 1980's gore fest adaptation of 'The Fault in our Stars', and I really do mean that in a good way.Overall this film is good fun, it's funny, surprisingly well produced, acted, shot and scored. It's not as good as the anime, but it is less than a sixteenth the total run time. If you enjoyed the life and death of Light Yagami, you may very well enjoy what his whiter, dumber but oddly more lovable Seattle counterpart has to offer..."
destinylives52,Not Worthy Of Your Time,05/10,25-Dec-17,"A book titled ""Death Note"" magically falls from the sky and comes into the possession of a teen-aged boy (played by Nat Wolff) who is sick of the injustices that he experiences. Flipping through the pages, Wolff reads the rules that are laid out in the book, the main one being the person whose name is written on the Death Note will die. Wolff doesn't believe all of this, of course, until the spirit that gives the Death Note power shows up suddenly in a somewhat comical scene. With a bit of prodding from the spirit, Wolff writes the name of his first victim - a school bully - into the Death Note, along with a general description of how the bully will die. Seconds later, it happens. And just like that, Wolff's descent into vengeance and darkness begins.Wolff doesn't go into this Faust-like journey alone. He reveals what the Death Note can do to his High School crush (played by Margaret Qualley), and she readily tangles herself up in this horror. Together, Wolff and Qualley write down the names of those whom they think are not fit to live, trying to right the many wrongs in this world. But power corrupts; and when the law comes close to solving the case of who is doing all these mysterious killings, the true natures of Wolff and Qualley will come out.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Death Note"" is the scene when the first victim is killed. It reminded me of a ""Final Destination"" style kill - gruesome and fun.""Death Note"" had such potential, all ruined by poor execution on the part of the director and writers. The movie is plagued by shenanigans. The lead investigator of the mysterious mass killings has a ""theory"" that the killer needs a name and a face before he or she kills. Although his theory is correct, it is never discussed exactly how that theory came to be. Then we have an abandoned, government black ops site that still contains secret files! Also, the spirit that gives the Death Note power is sometimes shown in a funny way, ruining scenes that could have been very tense and/or horrifying. There are more negative things to mention but I've wasted enough time on this movie, so I'll end it with this: ""Death Note"" is an eh movie that is good to watch if you have seen almost all the new movies out there and you're desperate to watch a new, sort of horror flick. Think of it as a granola bar: it won't satisfy you, but it'll keep you from starving.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
lucasspider,"The story is different, but still great.",08/10,25-Aug-17,"So I just watched this movie with mixed expectations and I just gotta say this: It was great! Though the story is not exactly the same as the original one from the anime (which i have seen), it was still very thrilling. The story still contains this 'crazy' vibe. The main character acting however, wasn't that good in the beginning. His screams sounded like a girls. He's also not THAT smart like Light from the anime. He's more of a good guy. Nevertheless the movie was still great. It had a great ending which still leaves me wondering and has my heart beating more rapidly than ever. I can understand that they had to change some things, its only to be expected. The movie is not supposed to only appeal the anime fans, I presume. I really hope there will be more of these movies originated from anime. However, it would be nice if they'd stick more to the original story. We've all noticed how much hate this has been getting, like for example on youtube."
arishsankar,Why did they even make this movie??,02/10,22-May-19,"Why Light is so dumb and L is black???This movie was so unlike its anime and manga counterparts its unreal on how bad this movie is the characters are boring, unlikable, stupid, and all around terrible characters even lights dad is stupid as wel

unique_spt_tyby,Not such a harsh review,06/10,30-Aug-17,"Let's start by saying that I've seen the anime a couple of times already because I think it's really good. I feel that people should be more open-minded when seeing the word ""Adaptation"", because that's what this movie is - an adaptation. It does not have to fully resemble the original series, which would also be impossible anyway, since it's a movie and (sadly) not a TV series. I thought it was okay, to be completely honest. I like to be surprised by certain things (in case of adaptations such as this one), i.e. I remember most of the stuff from the anime and it was OK to receive a somewhat different outcome of actions, instead of failing by trying to replicate the original. The acting was alright, the changes were something I could wrap my head around, overall good. What made me give it a 6/10 was the fact that it truly was too short, and I don't think anyone can deny that. It should have been a 2&1/2 hr movie, or made in two parts of two hours each, but these things are budget- influenced so it's not our decision to make. Either way, I would've enjoyed more, to be completely honest. Nice try, America.

EnderAzOphie,Original rewritten as a Saved By The Bell episode.,01/10,26-Aug-17,"The ONE redeeming quality of this movie is Ryuk's voice played by William Dafoe, because he gets the voice absolutely perfect. It's a shame that that level of method and skill wasn't applied to the writing/acting/score. (One more exception, L's acting is pretty good, done well with what he was given to work with, which I assure you is not much)THIS IS NOT A JOKE, just imagine the source material rewritten as an episode of Saved By The Bell. The maturity of this movie's plot is on par with a goosebumps novel, then spliced with some pretty gratuitous gore (like, really, out of nowhere, crazy gore). This adaptation doesn't get anywhere near to the psychological chess match that L and Light play in the source material. In fact, in this version, ANYONE could have figured out that Kira was Light, he's horrible at covering his tracks, has no game-face, and takes no steps to hide the Death Note whatsoever... in fact, he pulls it out any time the wind blows, in front of anyone, in public, anywhere. He even loudly discusses killing people with Mia in the middle of a crowded high school hallway, with people all around (no, that is not an exaggeration). In another earlier scene Light is sitting in a gym where a basketball and cheerleading practice are taking place to look through the rules of the Death Note, AFTER he already knows it's real, he chooses this extremely exposed space to whip it out and have a gander. He's also clearly not one of the popular kids, so why does he go to be around all of them? The setting for that scene makes no sense at all, and that's basically how the entire movie continues to play out. The whole suspense of the original premise stems from Light's cunning, but in the movie, L basically figures out that it's Light IMMEDIATELY. There is no investigative thrill. This movie tries to sell some hyper-cliché ""zero to hero"" motif, but then fails to ever really sell Light as a ""zero"". He doesn't have any real confidence issues, or other characteristics of a ""loser"". Not to mention that making Light a loser is a major departure from a core aspect of this entire story, because in the original the whole idea is that no one suspects Light because he is so attractive and popular. This movie is just absolutely poorly written. With so much ""creative freedom"" how could this have all gone so wrong?Okay now an ACTUAL SPOILER: in the last scene, you have this impossible chase between L and Light that is basically like a Saturday-morning-cartoon version of an already clichéd action-movie car chase, of which culminates in the most ridiculous setting, a Ferris wheel. And then the scene where Light and Mia fall out of the Ferris wheel is like some final-destination ripoff. Seriously, it's such convenient and lazy writing."
cbnewham,Really not that bad so long...,05/10,21-Apr-20,"...so long as you haven't seen the Japanese comic, which I haven't and so why I'm rating it 5 stars.Overall not a bad movie, although the plot is somewhat silly (why would anyone but the current owner of the book be able to write anything in it which would cause what's written to take place?)The acting was OK. The effects were of reasonable standard.Overall not as bad as the multiple 1 star reviews would have you believe. However, as I said, that's most likely only the case if you haven't seen the source material.

byrumthorsonk,Don't expect the same story as the original.,06/10,02-Sep-17,"Unsurprisingly to anyone who has read the manga or watched the original anime, this is a completely different story on many levels (Light is not popular, Mia (aka Misa) is not a death note holder or an actress, rules for the deathnote change). However that does not make it a bad movie. On its own without knowledge of the original story I feel it stands well enough on its own, granted it does ignore a couple of plot holes here and there and pulls some conclusions out of no where that were easily explained in the book. Regardless, the original story took place over literally years so I cannot imagine trying to tell the same story in less than two hours so I give it a pass. If you like this then use this as an excuse to go and watch the anime or even read the manga if you'd like. Also to be fair I think L was alright, he carried his demeanor well and with this portrayal expanded on how mentally unstable he was despite his intelligence.For those of us who know the original material though, we will all miss the psychotic, obsessed, scary intelligent, and manipulative person Light was. It stands true the original is always better, but given the restraints this movie dealt with I appreciate the risks and liberties it took in re-imagining this story. Besides, if you wanted to watch the original story so badly just go watch it just please give this movie a chance as, like I said, a re-imagining of the story not a retelling."
stop_thebeat,Another disastrous American remake of a Japanese classic. ALTP= VOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!,01/10,29-Aug-17,"I'm just going to come out & say it! Hollywood, STOP remaking Chinese/Japanese Anime/Horror films. You miss the point EVERY time, you cast on actor popularity rather than talent, you twist & change the events of the films to meet 'western' standards. It's painfully obvious from every one of the remakes that you don't understand the source material. It's also obvious that these series/films are set in such a way to make everything come together, character development, atmosphere, cinematography, soundtrack, & you miss everyone of these markers! Give up please it's embarrassing!This latest 'remake' is the worst i've seen since 'The Departed' at first I thought it was a comedy as the actor playing Light was extremely funny to watch. It felt like I was watching a Disney channel movie with OTT bloody & gore. Basically, 99.9% of this movie was utter BS! Willem Dafoe's voice was the best thing about this movie! A VOICE!!!!!!!! No one was cast correctly. Light & L's personality was the complete opposite from the Anime. It's like making a film with Batman & The Joker but allowing the actors to 'interpret' their personality & relationship. It did not work at all. Mia was just an annoyance that wasn't needed since her story wasn't added to the film at all! In fact, with the exception of Ryuk & the Death Note every single thing was incorrect. It was horrific embarrassing & a waste of time.Watch the Anime, it's the original and best. Anyone who's never seen the original may give this 3- 4, anything more is insanely generous given the haphazard approach to making this film."
sakram,A trainwreck.,03/10,20-Oct-17,"The only good thing about this movie is how it started and how it gave us the general glance on the movie, meh, that was a FALSE general glance. I repeat, that is a FALSE ALARM. This movie insults the original series, it changed every single thing about Death Note except for the concept, and they've done that HORRENDOUSLY wrong. Midway, the movie loses its point, and oh my god, 'L' loses his nerves ?Shame, if you're really having a boring time to spare and are already thinking 'Oh maybe it is not how everything sees it, maybe it's go-' FORGET IT.If you want a real good live action, go watch 'Death Note 2015' on Crunchyroll, although it's a series (Japanese) but it's done a pretty good job, unlike this piece of shameful trainwreckery.Maybe I wouldn't have rated this 3 out of 10 if I hadn't watched the original series, but good god help me, I wasted my time.2/10"
Venomage03,Death Note could have been much better,03/10,09-Jun-21,"The story has some interesting parts, but it was executed very poorly. The characters don't get enough screen time to shine. It has some good moments in it, but most of the time It's just not really enjoyable. The ending also destroys most of the movie for me, because it seems very forced.

mwziervogel,Not the same story,05/10,25-Aug-17,"I waited almost the whole month for this movie to come out, and while I waited, I watched the original series from beginning to end, and loved it... Then the movie came out today. I was very excited to see the anime series remastered in live action. But... when it finished, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. You see, the original series was about a high school teenager named Light Yagami who found a journal related to demons and entities from hell-called the death note. The death note was used for a killing purpose. You killed with the death note by having the person's face in mind and then you write their name in the book. With this Death Note, comes a death god who goes by the name of Ryuk who observes your experience with the death note. He is not your friend and does not care for you.later on through out the series, we find out that Light has a corrupted mind which drew me closer to his character, I've always liked the dark characters of either a movie or a series. I like the dark characters because they always make you question their humanity. Anyway, in the series, Light is proved to be the type of person who really only cares about himself, even at the end of the series, he says his father was a fool. Later on Light meets Misa Amane aka the second Kira. She is not like Light. She actually cares for him and other people, unlike Light, who doesn't. The character 'L' was an interesting person and was not like many other characters I've seen in movies/series. His personality is what caught my attention. He wasn't normal, as in he did things in a strange and different way to how other people would.Now... However the movie was very different to the show. let me shed some light on what I mean. First off, Light was not the mad man that he was in the series. He had more of a sane mind than the Light in the show. This Light also had a different surname, but I can understand that because in this movie he was not Japanese. This Light didn't kill the innocent but only the guilty. The Light from the TV series would have killed anyone that stood in his way.Then there is the Netflix version of Misa Amane which had a few Flaws to the character. In the 2017 live action movie, Misa is a completely different person. It was as if Misa was who Light was supposed to be. In this movie she was more like the anime version of Light than the actual Misa character. It was as if the writers decided to get rid of the original 2 characters and gave Margaret Qualley the Light (Anime version) character's personality... And then gave Nat Wolff a completely new character that never existed in the whole Death Note series.There was 2 characters I really liked but even they had some flaws. 1. 'L': The 'L' character from the movie kept the same personality traits as the original 'L' character from the show. But this version was to aggressive towards the end of the movie. The anime version of the 'L' character would have not freaked out when Watari died. Instead, he would have expected it. 2. Ryuk: Willem Dafoe's character was almost brilliant, only if he got more screen time than Misa Amane. Ryuk's character in this movie was very different to the anime version. This version of the Ryuk character was a bit more demanding than observing. For example, He encouraged Light to kill Kenny Doyle instead of just observing Light and not saying anything to see if Light would do it himself. Now again... My whole point of writing this review was to state 2 things that should have happened and did happen. Those things are... 1. The movie should have followed the original anime story.2. The movie was rushed (everything was happening to fast).But I have to say though, it was a really good movie and that's why I gave it a 50% rating. I just think it could have been better."
Guilvareux,Watch Original,03/10,17-Sep-17,"I watched the original anime and literally couldn't get through the film. This film is nothing like the anime it's based off and misses all of the themes that made the anime so great to watch. I could somewhat understand if they were different characters and a different story but apparently they're not. Horrific adaptation and not in the good sense.

My wife and I and our kids are totally into death note and we made it 12 minutes into the movie and went back to watching TV. It's bad really bad and the story line was forgotten and tossed out the window. Why take a great anime and make it something completely off base. bad review but someone should lose their job and career with this one. Why why why has this been such a bad year for animes to movies they all could have been great but not this one.

tin-B,Humorous Horror Hurray!,07/10,16-Jan-22,"I'm watching this on Netflix and thoroughly enjoying it. Furthermore, I hate anime. I can't tell you how much I detest anime. Anime truly sucks. So, unlike a bunch of other crybabies who are mad this isn't like their precious childish anime, I, on the other hand, can appreciate the great portrayal of humorous horror here. Willem Dafoe as the death god was a perfect choice. The kid playing the Light Turner, whoever he is, he delivered in all ways. His screaming in the detention room was fun, his acting, that is, facial expressions, voice inflections, timing and attitudes were great. People who think the acting was bad either don't like humorous horror, or they are whining because their anime was no longer their anime. Boo hoo.

mcbrauns,I can't even.,01/10,27-Feb-21,"TERRIBLE adaptation. There is absolutely nothing remotely close to the source material. Willem Defoe is good in this but it is a HARD pass. Please please please watch the anime or read thr Manga. It is an amazing story. The Netflix adaptation is NOT.

carlosvelasco69,Very bad adaptation of one of best series.,03/10,28-Aug-17,"The version of the movie does not fulfill the expectations that are expected of a story with an argument like Death Note. The series deserved a more reliable adaptation, not this crude invention for the American public. There is no sense of seeing clever and cunning characters with whom you enjoy that extreme duel in which they try to hunt.It is done like this to make another film better next year?

shayol-48294,IMDb score needs separation. People who have seen the original and the ones that didn't,08/10,27-Aug-17,"As one who never saw the original series, I don't understand why this movie gets so much hate.I liked the soundtrack, I liked the story, I liked the acting, I liked the colors and cinematography. Also the CGI was well done. From my point of view, after having seen almost all the better known movies and series for the last 20 years, this one is really good in comparison.I believe all the haters compare their memory of the original death note along with some kind of nostalgia feelings with the movie. And surprise they are disappointed after that, how could it be in any other way. I believe that is the same situation with all the remakes or even just using of the name. Ghost in the Shell, The last Airbender, Dragonball Z, Total Recall, etc. A new adaptation is mostly meant to tell an existing good story, that appearance might be a little outdated to a new audience, not to improve the old movie for the old fans.From this movie I got vibes like Final destination, Stranger Things and Blade Runner. I am not saying the story is similar, just saying what feeling I had while watching was similar. So if you like Thriller, with a little touch of Fantasy, Psycho and also comedic reliefs and most importantly, IF YOU DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE LIKE THE SERIES OR EVEN BETTER THAT YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE SERIES, then this movie is something for you I guess.."
djanfaza,Don't listen to the haters,10/10,26-Dec-17,"If you're like me you'd watch this movie and think it was pretty good. So good that I rewatched it with my wife, as we began watching she looked up the IMDb rating. A 4.6! I was surprised but she watched it anyway. At the conclusion she said this makes no sense and googled why is death note so poorly rated. So being your average viewer and having no clue this was an anime series made into an American movie, it's a good movie. I'm giving it a 10 to try to mitigate all the unfair reviews from anime fans. Because very few people give a sh*t if it holds true to the anime series, but these are the people trashing the movie online. I would give it probably a solid 7.5 in reality, def worth a watch.

justbob1982,Misguided adaptation,05/10,07-Mar-21,"Version I saw: Netflix stream
Actors: 6/10
Plot/script: 4/10
Photography/visual style: 7/10
Music/score: 5/10
Overall: 5/10By the time I saw this film on the second day of release, it was already getting very bad word-of-mouth. Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata's original manga and the anime adaptation are both widely considered to be high-water marks of their forms, so it seemed an obvious choice for Netflix, and indeed only a matter of time, but...
Many of the changes it makes are entirely reasonable, and I have no argument with them. Transplanting the action to America, renaming characters, all par for the course. However, the more subtle changes betray that the director and writers did not have a clue what they had.
At its heart, Death Note is a competition of elaborate mind games between two beguiling but amoral genius psychopaths, Light Yagami and the mysterious investigator L. Genius chess, if you will, but with lives on the line. Director Adam Wingard and writers Charley and Vlas Parlapanides and Jeremy Slater reframed their Light Turner as a clever but awkward, emotionally wrought teenager. This might seem like an understandable decision, to make him relatable to a western audience... but that would be fundamentally missing the point of Death Note! We end up with something that is a lot more generic, and a lot more mediocre.
There is a lot of good and a lot of bad in the adaptation. Willem Dafoe is superbly cast as the demonic Ryuk, and some of the plot developments are indeed fairly clever. It's visually pretty stylish too, with plenty of visual flair that feeds into the emotional tone from the outset. On the other hand, the soundtrack is very cheesy, and there are some daft decisions regarding props and set dressing too.
To be good on balance, a film has to have more good than bad, and this Death Note adaptation simply doesn't. For every good detail or element - and there are plenty of them - it has something rubbish. I can't recommend it at all.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno."
redblacksky,Absolute hot garbage,01/10,03-Jun-20,"Couldn't make it through 5 minutes of this movie. Everything about it is horrible. What a way to absolutely massacre one of the best storylines ever written

dragon-x-696-306414,Perfectly fine,06/10,28-Aug-17,"There are many terrible Anime adaptations out there, but what really makes them terrible is not that they weren't faithful, but that even if separated from their source material they are mediocre at best. Death Note is not one of those.I was very worried when I heard about this version of Death Note, and like most I feared for the worst. These worries have vanished now that I have actually seen it. It has its flaws, of course, but it's nothing I wasn't able to gloss over, to get entertained for a little while.You will not find a faithful adaption here, nor a masterpiece of film making, but it doesn't deserve the hate it gets from the Anime fans. If viewed for itself this movie is perfectly fine, and if you have either not seen the Anime or can manage to forget about it for the duration of the movie, give it a try.

Jim-Eadon,Could have been great,04/10,22-Jul-18,"I am a sucker for movies with gimmicks like this. But this failed for a few reasons. The protagonist was OK, but the femme fatale girlfriend was only so-so. There was no discernable bond between the cop dad and son either. The young detective was extremely annoying.
I hear that this is based on Japanese anime, so I'll watch that.
Then there was the exposition, the kid states he's seen an 8 foot demon. Yes we know, you showed it us! Never spell out what you've shown us, this is seriously infuriating. If someone is too dumb to follow a simple plot then so what?
The demon seemed to be there as a kind of voice over deus ex machina. He was unnecessary, and made the movie goofy.
The light twists in this movie were the best thing about it, but they were in a vacuum.
I don't hate this movie in the way I hate, say, the new Starwars nonsense, it was mostly entertaining. But mistakes were made that stopped it being fun.

dwilliamsdcc,Flawed but enjoyable with a redeeming conclusion,07/10,25-Aug-17,Being a fan of the original Manga and Anime adaptions I wasn't expecting to like this and for part of the movie it looked like my expectations would be proved correct. Ryuk drives too much of Light's early actions instead of playing the role of interested observer and Mia soon becomes the instigator in total contrast to the submissive role Misa plays in the source material. Nevertheless as the plot developed i began to warm to this vision of Mia and L though I did find Light Turner far to week in comparison to Light Yagami. The run time could have done with another 40 minutes or so to flesh out the rise of Kira. It all feels a little too rushed. There is never a dull moment with everything happening at a fast pace but a little more character building for Light might have made him more likable.Where the movie excelled for me was the ending which took the form of a twist in the tale. In the final big reveal we finally see the manipulative scheming side of Light Yagami find its way into the character and the mild cliffhanger had me hoping L would stay his hand and leave the page blank so we could see a sequel at some point in future.This film is a lot better than some of the reviews on here suggest Ultimately I would suggest the anime series is a far better watch but this adaption is a good starting point to introduce people to the Death Note world.
hboldfield,Bad but amazing,08/10,28-Aug-17,There are 2 points to be made 1 if you are basing this movie off of the anime the movie is terrible and sucks horrendously how the movie transfers misa misa into Mia was just wrong 2 if you look at its own movie and not compare it to the anime it is amazing. I spent the first part of the movie laughing and criticizing it for how bad it was but then as I see that Netflix made their own plot it was almost as good as the anime.the end where Lite escapes death and how L isn't really the same but deranged and kills Lite was perfect. look at it as it is its own movie. P.S. Ryuk was spot on loved his eyes and personality.
veinctor,A good Light!,08/10,23-Mar-19,"I'm sure most reviews focus on the negatives, so I with focus on the things I liked.This is not the story of Light Yagami but the story of Light Turner. So in a sense, this is a continuation of the story we all loved from the anime. Turner's dad is also a cop but hey, turner is not a great student or a genius and he gets bullied.Light having his mom dead, speeds up the story because he has a target to kill. I like how this movie starts like a reverse Final Destination movie, where the protagonist creates the gruesome deaths.Anyone who touches the Death Note cant see the Death God, that's an interesting take.In the anime it was always bothering me how Kira suddenly gone mad and was a self proclaimed god. Here, Light actually wants to create a god - a symbol of hope that helps the weak. Light (and not the public) creates the Kira persona. I didn't know that ""Kira"" means ""Light"" in Russian, thats pretty cool. Thank you movie!Having a black L is good. Reminds me when Light and L played chess. Also black is the opposite of.. light? heh.Turner's relationship with Mia is a bit sudden (you dont just admit you are a murderer to a girl you barely know) but I like how she is pushing him to use the Death Note when he is trying to be reasonable. She even tells his to kill the good guys when he doesnt want to. Reminds me of the manipulation of Adam by Eve from the Bible, thanks to the apples we see everywhere.Turner stops killing people suspects the police are on to him. This makes sense but it's not what happened in the anime. Both takes are legit in my opinion. Turner admits that by killing FBI agents, Kira is not a good guy anymore. This is very true, and I can relate to this Light much more than the original on this. He also doesnt manipulate his girlfrind and I guess he loves her, unlike the original Light. But yeah, the original Light was devious and awesome in his own right.Funny thing, there is a warning in the DN, not to trust Ryuk (he didn't die, duh). Then Turner warns Ryuk that he will write Ryuks name in the DN (it's alreayd there man!). Ryuk said that the most anyone manage to write is 2 letter. Well, thats a movie mistake.There is a rule where Light can burn a page (once per book) to cancel someone's death. This is neat and shows Light's pacifist side. Also Ryuk is indeed not a friend as he implies that Light will be the first to die when someone else gets the DN. Mia is the bad guy as she write's Lights name in there to blackmail him into giving the DN to her. This is a very good twist!We get to learn L's background story and see the place he grew up which is neat. If you don't write cause of death they dont' die of a heart attack like in the original, but anyway Ryuk wants to kill them. I like that.In any case, it's a good new and refresh take, 15 years after the original."
lucas-svieira-rj,Forget the haters fans,10/10,01-Oct-21,"Of course the 10 stars its because of the kids who dont accept change in their favorite anime, giving 1star? Hahaha Go cry in the shower insted, spoil little kids, while you are crying the creators of DeathNote are freaking rich haha its an ADAPTATION , and its ok, people who never saw the anime will like It, and the adults who saw the anime Will like it too.

KATO-SUBZERO,"A ""Wishmaster"" rip off.",03/10,07-Sep-17,"7 September 2017, I sat through half of this flick and it was funny and boring me to sleep. Many years ago when I was in college, one of my professors told the class that 'every idea has been done at least once or twice.' ' All someone is doing is writing a new twist on a old idea.That is the case here, In the year 1997, a good horror film came out followed by three sequels. ""Wish Master' starring, Andrew Divoff and Tammy Lauren and Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund. This film is similar to Wishmaster, but not nearly as good and Not worth the matinée price of admission. Save your money on a more worthwhile horror flick. I am going to sleep now which I will enjoy better than what I saw in this flick. Wake me up when it is over.

noloxtreme,Haha ha ha ha ha ha ha,02/10,25-Aug-17,"Wow, even though my subject contains laughter, this poor attempt isn't even unintentionally funny. This film literally has no redeeming qualities. I have no idea why it was made. Light doesn't act like Light. L at least attempts to mimic the L in the anime but there is nothing to indicate the brilliance of L. The anime even managed to be more realistic than this live remake of Death note. The only Netflix original movies I like are anime and the wonderful ""Beasts of no nation"". I want my hour and thirty minutes back.

vishnu-dileep08,"""A below average movie, I have not seen the anime of this then maybe I would not have given it this rating""",05/10,05-Nov-17,"Summary (no spoilers) This movie is about a high school student named Light Turner who discovers a mysterious book that has the power to kill anyone whose name is written within its pages and he launches on a secret mission to rid the world of all its criminals.My Review (no spoilers)I found the plot out to be just below average maybe because I have not watched the anime. I will keep it in my watch list. The hero Natwolff did a convincing job of acting in this movie. There was a little adventure in this movie other than that nothing much. It had an unpredictable ending .Overall the plot had a lot of potential but something's were really rushed thru.My RecommendationNo, I would not recommend this movie to anyone.My Rating5/10"
jaredadouglas,Bloody great,10/10,26-Aug-17,"I know everyone else reading this is gonna hate on me but let me start my case, I've never seen the original anime series and I hope to soon, I'm sure after I've watched it I will see the flaws with this film but at this very time, I thought this was fantastic, it captured exactly what the Death Note is with a surprising, twisting story. It goes for the right length of time and that's another thing I love about this movie. Acting was great, casting choices were well done and the cinematography was amazing. I will surely be watching this over and over for years to come and that's why I have got to give it MY rating of a 10/10. Like I said, after I watch the original, I will see what is wrong so please don't hate on this and just enjoy the movie."

gscreativ,Good effort,06/10,25-Aug-17,"Lets make it clear, is a good effort, since the anime has a lot more of story and time to tale, I just don't like that the main problem of the film is related to a simple teen relationship, it does not sound like the source material, yes I know, is more complex on the anime and more developed but thats the thing that catched the attention in the first place, in the end of the film I was expecting something more dramatic as in the anime, to me the end of the anime was perfect to close all the story."
joriethomas,Travesty,01/10,05-Feb-21,"I'm not an avid anime fan but my son begged me to watch death note and it was so amazing. He told me the movie was bad but I had to give it a chance. I understand you can't fit 13+ hrs worth of content into an hour+ movie and I also understand changing things to speed up plot lines but there's a line and they crossed it. Altering personalities, intelligence, plot points in general, etc. Aside from Wilhelm Dafoe (who was grossly underutilized) and Lakieth whose character was butchered, the acting was completely horrendous.

Ryuk maybe is what it is best done in the film, but also it could be better, not sure if they doesn't want make a more similar Ryuk or it was the best that they could do.

StregaAsuka,Really Dead Note (better watch the original one),02/10,29-Aug-17,"First of all, skip this disappointing movie and go watch the anime or read the manga that ""inspired"" it, for not finding a better word to describe what they have done with that masterpiece. This review is full of spoilers, so read under your own discretion. But before all of that, if you have not watched Death Note (nor read the manga), then you will probably like the movie. But as that is not my case, I am ready to unload!! Now, let's get started!!This story differs from the original one in many aspects. What has surprised me the most is that we don't learn that much about Ryuk, we don't know why he eats those apples nor do we witness any bond he might share with Light; which is really sad, as what they were playing between them was funny to watch and added a little bit of mystery to the main story. In here: nothing, they are two perfectly strangers. The relationship between Light and Mia, it's the relationship between two boring teenagers. That's it. There isn't the manipulative one that we read in the manga, and that made us hate Light even a bit and feel sorry for Misa; in here the hormones rule. On the other side, we have also the lack of relationship between Light and L. While in the original one, they are playing the game of the cat and mouse, here everything goes like in a CSI episode: too fast and to direct. (L doesn't appear until almost half of the movie by the way). They have also erased some characters like Light's mum and sister, why bother to pay more actors who would play characters that they didn't know what to do with them?Then the characters. Yes L is black, but who cares? That's the least of our concerns. Light is supposedly to be smart, like really smart and a cold person. Here he is an average bookworm (kind of loser) and that's it. He isn't the cold-blooded murderer we know from the original manga (who only kills the bad guys, don't forget) and who seeks justice whatever and whoever the cost might be. Who in their right mind shows the power of the Death Note to your school fling before you even realize the power you have in your hands? (Those are again the American hormones ruling over). Next is Mia, who differs in everything from the original Misa. She is a bit of a cliché of the popular high school girl, or that is what we might think at the beginning of the movie, because 10 min into it we no longer care. It's a shame that in the movie wasn't included some details like that she is somebody that comes from outside Light's world and that she has a Death Note of her own with her own Shinigami (that deal with the Shinigami's eye, is really missing!!). Finally, there is L. He behaves like the L from the manga, until he starts to her hormonal and feeling too much, and he should not!! And one might think why is he jumping onto chairs, has he eaten a kangaroo? He should be as cold-blooded as Light, that's why their fight was so awesome to follow in the manga and anime, to see who of the two would success and win over the other. In here: nothing, just teens. In this movie all characters are made in the USA style way too much, nothing worth remembering.At some points in the movie they play it cool using cool music in the most critical moments of the movie, not critical enough for us by the way, and the whole movie has dark colours, which is fine. But that's it. Nothing makes sense, even less that finale that is presented to us; and by the way, you will realize that the movie has ended because the credits start rolling, not because it feels like it has ended. And after you wake up, you will think which kind of end was that and how did they trick you to waste 1h 40min of your live watching this movie.Worst of all? They are going to make two more movies!!"
josephd-18087,Pretty bad- Someone who never saw the original,04/10,04-Sep-17,"I don't watch Anime so I don't know anything about the original. However this movie made sure I don't care at all to see the original. As someone who sees this movie as it's own entity, it doesn't hold much water.The concept of this movie is pretty interesting; a kid finds a book that when he writes someone's name in it, they die. Not the most thought out though. Does it have to be their birth name? What if they had it legally changed? It sounds like stupid nitpicking but a large portion of the plot is based around that kid not knowing someone's real name. Along with a bunch of confusing rules that the movie never cares to explain at all, you sit there the whole time going ""why doesn't he just do _____?"" Or ""Why can't he do that?"" It is very frustrating since the premise is all it has going for it. Well that and the death God character Ruik (Ryuk? Riuk? Ryuik? Riyk?) who was played very well and the guy I personally was rooting for the whole time. Back to the premise, of course the book falls into the hands of a kid, who though isn't exactly the ""edgy misunderstood kid"" stereotype (his girlfriend, however, fits the bill pretty damn well) he is pretty annoying. He is rational until the plot needs him not to be. Also can we have a teenage protagonist for once whose parents are both alive and happily married? Please. Characters- The characters are pretty bad. Only the main character barely escapes being a poorly fleshed out stereotype. Let's see... edgy teen girlfriend, single father who doesn't understand his son, an over the top bully who resorts to punching people and slapping papers out of people hands, a teacher who doesn't give a rat's ass about his student's well being, it is like I am hitting a cliché checkbox. Then there is L. I have no idea what anybody was thinking when they made this character. He is squats on chairs, eats nothing but candy, and is supposedly a great detective, except he can't figure simple stuff out. As I said, the best character is Riuk, who is well acted, funny, charming, and cool looking. As for the acting, most of the time it is fine but it can get bad quick.Editing- In the beginning the editing looked like something from a student film. Awful shots, cuts, transitions, you name it. By the end I didn't notice it less. Perhaps they toned it down or maybe I just got used to it.Pacing- It was fast. It makes no wasted time getting to the book. It is pretty fast however at one point it skipped over a part that seemed much more interesting than what we got to see.Music- Good Lord... Reread the description of this movie. Now ask yourself what kind of soundtrack this movie should have. Stop right there. You are wrong. 80's Soft Rock and Pop. I mean what the hell was somebody thinking? Now I am not a fan of that kind of music to begin with, however it was so out of place that it was laughably stupid.In the end this movie is mediocre at best but is worth a watch if the premise sounds interesting. Don't go in with high hopes (or expecting the next Battlefield Earth as some of these reviews would have you expect). All in all it is pretty bad, but nowhere near the travesty followers of the source material would have you believe. Quite honestly the premise of this movie is interesting enough that it could have been much better had it not been chained to a source material, no matter how good that may have been."
greggame,actually it is not bad as they say ...,08/10,03-Sep-17,"... first of all, I am huge fan of original series (movies and manga) and at first I was furious about what they show in trailer ... BUT actually when I finally decided to give it chance I find it very interesting as a point of different view of Death note and I like it ... actually it is not bad at all, it is just different and that's a good thing in today copy/paste world :)I am looking forward for second part.

ap_pleheart79,"I've seen the original Manga, and I *still* like this...",08/10,26-Jul-20,"Before the Fanboys crucify me for even suggesting my title, give me a chance to explain.Yes, this is an Americanized, white-washed, echo of the Manga. Hollywood took a looooot of free artistic license with this, but I'm going to suggest you do something if you've read or seen the Manga before watching this.Forget EVERYTHING you know.That's it.Now, that's better. I like this Director/Producer's interpretation of the story, even if it isn't 100% Canon. At first I wasn't too impressed with the gentleman that played Light, but by the end, I thought he pulled it off well enough. Now-the guy they got to play ""L"", I LOVED his acting for it. I love that they chose a black man to be L, his lilting voice sounded just like L's trains of thought, and the constant sweets eating, the way he sat, and the (one) shot of the bare feet harkened back to the Manga. There were plenty of other little Easter eggs here and there, but I won't spoil them. Ryuk....ahhh Ryuk...probably my favorite character, in the original and in this version. Willem Dafoe ""killed"" it (ha ha) as Ryuk, plus his voice is just perfect for the role.Did I like how they added a girlfriend factor? No, not really, but they were able to make a short enough movie to explain how the Death Note works and then show some crazy gross footage to prove the point, without it being dragged out longingly over 10 episodes to explain the same thing.The average American that doesn't know the original story is t going to know it took over 10 episodes to explain that, and they don't have time for 10 episodes. They came to see a movie, so a movie they will get! So, throw in a complicated girlfriend and Ta-Da! Instant messed up story!
It can be hard to squash something down that's very long in length and still manage to get the point across.Same ""audience factor"" with L wearing shoes in most of the shots we see him in. Average American, not knowing original Canon, won't know the difference. Average fanboy is SCREAMING ""IF L WEARS SHOES IT REDUCES HIS INTELLIGENCE BY 26%!!! HE CAN'T WEAR SHOES WHY IS HE WEARING SHOES THEY MESSED THAT UP!!""Again-look who the Movie Producers are catering to-they want all the $$$ they can rake in, so they're not going to keep every. single. little. detail. exactly like the Manga. Plus, your average person would question why he wasn't wearing shoes in some dangerous situations.While we didn't get to hear the inner dialogue that makes the Manga so interesting, perhaps the reason the Manga has to use the inner dialogue is because it's much harder to animate body language to match the outer ""keep it cool"" mood than it is for good actors to portray that same type of edginess, therefore the need for the inner dialogue isn't there.Do I wish they could have made it an exact copy and still made it live version? Sure, I guess if I wanted to sit through a 12-hour movie. There's already a live-action miniseries to explain everyone and everything better.For what the writer/director has to work with, I thought the special effects were GREAT, with the exception of the Ferris wheel, that still looked a little cartoony to me, but the acting was decent, the scenes were good, the action shots were good, it told the story well enough to get the gist, and still managed to stay under 2 hours.Plus, the little twists at the end were neat too."
ricardoatsouza,Good action and story,08/10,15-Sep-17,"I also watched the Death Note anime and, from previous experiences, I was very aware that this movie would not follow the same line. From that perspective, I did enjoy the movie.<== THIS MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS ==>The characters behavior is way different from the anime, but the main goal of the movie was the same: how does the Death Note changes the live in general? And what's the price for using it?From that perspective, you can easily see how the events in the movie escalates quickly, and how easy the characters lose control of what's happening. It's amazing how this specific characteristic is shown in the movie. Prepare yourself to see very different Light and L in the movie. Be aware that the chess fight in between them is not the plot of it. Light is a naive guy, and L (although smart), way more human. Light does show potential of being more capable than he actually is, but he doesn't know how to manage the situation.In the end, the movie does show how the Death Note can affect everyone's life, and the question remains open: should the human race ever have this kind of power?"
steveoreano-730-467161,Another failed adaptation,02/10,30-Aug-17,"***spoiler***I went into the movie with an open mind, even though I'm not a fan of movie adaptations for a good reason. Avatar the last Airbender and Dragon ball for example were horrible live actions. That being said, this movies portrayals of the characters with the exception of Ryuk were way off from being accurate. In the anime, L and Light are calm, intelligent, and loners. In the movie, light immediately trusts in a school girl that he absolutely does not know with the secret of the death note, which is the opposite of what light would do. One thing that threw me off was that out of no where, L suspected light of being Kirra, which in the show took time to get to that point. It seems rushed and sloppy with an entire show being squished into an hour and 30 minute movie. In all honesty I didn't finish the last 30 minutes. Its not worth it, the only authenticity of it was Ryuk. Other than that don't waste your time."
mobadizhere,Interesting and doable!,07/10,11-Sep-18,"Full disclosure, I haven't watched the anime yet. So don't be quick to judge. Death Note the adaptation was surprising to me, because I thought it wouldn't work as a film. It actually does, and the only complaint i have is that some of the acting is a little bad. Other than that, it's likable. I loved how Willem Dafoe plays as Ryuk, it works alot. Overall, Death Note is entertaining, even if it doesn't contribute to the anime fully.

amichnea,10 Because I didn't watch/read the Animes/Mangas,10/10,12-Sep-20,"I did not read or watch the original sources ie Manga or Anime. I just watched this movie and found it fun but maybe a little rushed. I lost the plot a bit as things were moving too fast, like how L figured stuff out and what happened at the end.Based on my viewing I do recommend it, it is like Final Destination meet the Final Wish or Wishmaster? Anyhow I do wish that this was done in two parts, give it more context, or that they did a follow up.I will be watching Death Note. Has been added to my Netflix list:) see how that is. I think that there is also a live action series, might be worth looking into it.

alexqueens,"Could have been much better, but wasn't the worst effort",06/10,30-Oct-19,"I initially came for Willem Dafoe, but turns out he's but a mere voice for the demon, that looks to be a cross between CGI and a body suit - and an image I still can't decide if it's good or bad.Having watched a fair few episodes of the original anime series (2006), before eventually tiring of it and losing interest in anime altogether, I was already familiar with the premise and much of the story.
And while I don't usually have high aspirations for Americanised versions of Asian cinema/stories, this managed to achieve a decent enough version of it. Especially when taking into account that compressing a whole series into one feature film is a challenging feat, and that will aways be a problem where depth and character development is concerned.I liked that it wasn't a complete teenage fanfare aimed at only the younger generation. And the younger actors were fairly decent, and not the type that are just pretty faces with a lack of genuine facial expressions.
I liked the synth score and dark overtones.
I liked Shea Whigham as both the dad and detective.
LaKeith Stanfield playing L was an interesting choice.Some cheesy writing in some parts, but I'll let that slide."

pierreolivier-21287,So many mistakes and changes done that turned an awesome story to a piece of bullshits,02/10,30-Aug-17,"So many shortcuts that don't show how intelligent Light is. And what is this ending?! Are you planning a second movie?! If you did, that would have been good that the first one was somewhat OK. Light is supposed to be smart and prepares plan to take down L and conversely. And isn't there supposed to be a second death note with a second death god? What happens now that you completely modified the story. Bringing this story to an American background could have worked but modifying the personality of the characters makes no sense. To sum up, this is some bullshit movie. :) And I lost time watching it.

joshuafreakolo,Nothing I love in the anime is in this movie,01/10,26-Aug-17,"I think the original writer of death note will not want his work to be comparing to this movie. Based on the personality of the main character portrayed in this movie, does he even looks like someone who wants to change the freaking world? Everything is poorly written story line and script."
bbelladdonna,Death Note 2017 Noted in the Notebook,01/10,29-Aug-17,"Man doesn't know where to begin if his huge disappointment with this movie was to be justified by a list of reasons. Total waste of the potential of the original anime idea. The development lacks the minimum thrill: a ten-year-old would have displayed more vivid imagination and come up with a more challenging plot and satisfying ending. The music choice is silly and incompatible with the action.The characters are painfully reduced to ridiculously unfinished sketches deprived of depth and likability. Light (rather ambitious name for somebody who hardly flickers), is supposed to be a bright student but we didn't see him shine. As for L, I had great expectations from the brilliant young detective but his bad-ass tenacity quickly crumbled like a fortress of sand and he turned into a sentimental nuisance. Yes, he was devastated by the loss of his mentor, but he didn't make him proud by getting broken beyond repair. All in all, the movie is a tiring hustle-bustle as if ten randomly picked local amateurs were given a task to make a project, and failed. Sadly, or not, it will probably end in the death notebook."
darklydreamingrahu,Seriously Bad,03/10,31-Oct-20,"I won't spend much time with this review. Why should I?No spoilers here, as if that matters for a movie this bad.The animated series Death Note, lifted directly from a popular Japanese manga of the same name, is a fantastic piece of media.I don't even usually care much for animated features, but the original Death Note is a brooding, brilliantly written cat-and-mouse story with a lot of brains and a lot to say.Unfortunately, the live-action feature does the series no justice.There are some good things here, such as the visuals and cinematography. Whoever shot and designed the visuals of this movie was a fan of the source material.Everyone else must have been here for a Netflix check.Keith Stanfield, who plays L, is the exception to this. Though he is given very little to work with, he is still able to nail the mysterious, idiosyncratic nature of the character.Too bad this great talent and eye for the character is utterly wasted along with everything else.The young-adult targeted high-school romance element was absolutely a terrible direction to take Death Note.No, guys. NO.The lack of inner-monologue or any real cat-and-mouse tension strips much of atmosphere, most of the tension, and all of the character study that made the original so great.Dafoe is wasted as Ryuk, the God of Death. Again, Ryuk LOOKS good enough for the part, but the relationship between him and Light has been completely stripped. What's left is a spooky-looking creature who creepily laughs and gives exposition sometimes.I could go on and on, but I won'tIf you haven't seen the original Death Note, do yourself a cinematic favor and go start the animated series on Netflix right now. Avoid this travesty at all costs, unless you want to rag on how bad it is for an hour and 40 minutes with your friends.If you have seen Death Note, and you're going to watch this, then you've been warned.3/10"
DragonsDied,Ignore the average rating,10/10,14-Nov-22,"I really hesitated before investing my time for this movie thanks to the ratings but the interesting plot made me watch it eventually. Fans of the manga/anime series obviously didn't like this movie so all found the right to rate this movie 1 or maximum 3, but just look at the budget and ask yourself, if any production costing 50M$ would ever come to life if it indeed were to be a 4.5 movie. I loved the movie, sure one can think of some alternative storylines, but all the low ratings made me do is to get interested in checking out the manga/anime, apparently that is even much better than this, which must then be amazing I guess.

bradp1337,Not as bad as everyone says it is!,07/10,26-Aug-17,"I really think the hate for this film stems from the fans of the anime and manga! There is a preconceived notion that you cannot make a good movie from anime and manga source material but you can, and Death Note does a good job of it! Don't get me wrong, I've watched all forms of Death Note, it is my favorite anime and if people ask me if they should watch it I ask them if they watched other anime before? If they tell me no then I say not yet because it will ruin other anime for you. It shouldn't be the first anime you watch! Sure, you will get much more content in 20, 40, or 300 episode anime's but for the millions of people who won't watch that, or for someone who wants in my case a very decent Death Note Movie this is a good watch! Sure it deters from the story but it still captures the eeriness and sense of dread you feel when really thinking about what a kid with that kind of power might do, especially if you are already a butt head in real life! If you are someone panning this movie just because it has the name Death Note and is westernized shame on you, and it's because of that conception we might not get as much live action sourced anime as I'd like."
Students_SimoneVeil,Warning Fans of Death Note !,04/10,10-Jan-19,"The Death Note talks about Light Yagami a young student and he discover the
Death Note. I didn't like this movie because the characters are not similar to
the original series Death Note. I just liked Riuk and his book, Riuk is a god of
the death and the book is for kill. I think the writer has broken the original characters. The main characters are Nat Wolf in the role of L a good detective, Lakeith Stanfield in the role of Light Yagami and Maragret Qualley in the role of a girls friend of Light Yagami. If you are a big fan or just fan of Death Note, you shouldn't watch this movie

I could see a few ways it could be changed in order to make an okay movie, but the way they did it in this movie was horrendous. Even without any prior knowledge of the show, it's a ridiculous plot with a very dumb and anticlimactic ending.

alkuchoudhary,An absolute delight.,10/10,24-Aug-17,"Some of you may be looking at the rating and be shocked. But trust me this movie is way better than one may expect it to be.I myself am a big fan of the source material and I can tell you that death note is the best adaptation of anime till now.(not that it has a tough competition). So well this movie is worth your time. Direction Damn Adam Wingard is a good director. The whole movie is shot in a very clever and stylish way. Even if someone finds the movie dull at few points, the direction will constantly put your interest back. Acting William Dafoe is amazing as ryuk, anyone could have guessed that. But what was surprising to me was Lakeith Stanfield was absolutely amazing. I could not have thought of a better actor to play L and I realized that when i saw the movie. Nat Wolff was also pretty good. Margaret as Mia also did a good job playing a crazy Misa(Mia). Cinematography was again, impressive. You may be thinking that I am being too kind to the movie but its just because it took me by shock. I like many people did not really have high hopes but damn the movie was impressive. The ending was shocking in a really good way. No one could have thought of that. The best thing of death note is the cat and mouse chase and that was done really good. The movie has a really creepy vibe to it and it does an amazing job in giving you chills. The movie has been adapted faithfully but in a way its original too. Its a must watch for both the fans and the newbies. If i had to point out a flaw, then i would just say that the first part is kinda rushed but don't worry the movie covers up for that. Ignore the hate and Enjoy the movie. Don't go into the movie for hating it , go with the hope of enjoying it and the movie will shock you.(not exaggerated) Loved it!"
negronignig,Milking gullible for netflix pennies.,01/10,26-Aug-17,"This movie reminds me of a work of an IT company that has separate departments that barely communicate with each other, half of the work is outsourced to India, and team leads get just vague direction from management about what is exactly they are doing. As a result everyone just implements whatever they see fit without any consistency, without any real analysis of the matter and after the work was done you would have to spend couple of years to unwind the spaghetti crap code they all produced.The only reason this movie has a rating more than 2 is the several pages of bought reviews. Seriously just take a look at first pages of reviews they are all 9s and 10s, and are probably outsourced in the same places."

If you had any respect for the source material you would have read the script and walked away. Instead you saw the opportunity to work on a huge IP and hopefully get your name out there. Well guess what: you did, and people hate you for it. Nat Wolff is ridiculous and screams like a whiny child and is just a creep. Lakeith Stanfield is an absurd cry-baby. But the most abominable perpetrators are Adam Wingard, the Parlapinades brothers, and Jeremy Slater. To them I say this: how little respect do you have for not just the source material, but the fans who made the source material into the cultural juggernaut that it is? You looked at our fandom and said ""I can take advantage of this"", and proceeded to dash our hopes on the shores of your below sub-par ""vision"".I don't think any real fan of the original had very high hopes for this. The moment I found out they were doing this adaptation I groaned and face-palmed. For the most part, Americans cannot adapt Japanese works. It's just a fact. Our cultures are similar, but just different enough that the idiosyncrasies that make the respective cultures and the media that they produce what they are get not just lost in translation, but mutilated. Netflix, PLEASE for the love of a death god, let this die. You have 100 people on twitter who have terrible taste in movies egging you on to make a sequel, but THOUSANDS of people who made it possible for you to even pitch this idea due to their fandom asking you to let it die. If you make a sequel you will see the numbers are DRASTICALLY different from the first movie, because any fan of the source material who humoured the idea of an adaptation felt the slap in the face you gave them and are not turning the other cheek."
gurinderplay,We have been insulted with this movie,01/10,26-Aug-17,"It was like the highlights. It was made in a sense that, ""you already know how it goes, so why bother?"" They tried to change the story-line, but did that it in the most sloppiest manner they could. Makers of death note would be ashamed horribly if someone would judge the anime by watching this movie, as the anime is one of the greatest. Plus even if you don't compare it with the anime, this movie would suck on its own because there is no buildup to anything whatsoever. Everything is already there. You have to assume most of the things. Don't watch it, its a waste of time. I don't know why someone would screw this up so bad. I didn't it to be this bad.

mps_animaxfriends,Butchered classic,04/10,21-Nov-20,"Let's start with a positive: I did LOVE the shinigami, that cgi and character design popped off! Absolute perfection 👌 was not disappointed
But that's where everything goes down hill:
If you have seen the anime then you'll definitely be disappointed as I am. It was a mess. A big hot mess.
They managed to take out everything that made death note good and gave it character. Also, the fact that they set it in America made is worse and whitewashed an Asian series. There is no excuse for that.
Then, you have the disappointment that is light, where was the bravado and narcissism that defined light? Where is the sociopathic character development that eventually leads him to think he is a god?

JayDiggler,From Someone Who Never Saw the Anime,09/10,16-Sep-17,"All the user reviews are how it doesn't follow the anime plot or issues with character changes etc. My review is simple, I never saw the anime and loved this movie. I hope people watch it so they make a sequel. It feels like Final Destination in a lot of ways and the ending surprised me.

srisrisaru,"Sad to see the losers hate this movie, which is actually incredible.",10/10,22-Aug-17,"So, I luckily got a chance to see this film at a screening and I can tell you that this film is worth your time. It's a new take but it keeps the core concepts of the anime. The cinematography was remarkable. Acting , well that was surprising since I did not expect it to be that good. It's sad seeing that some critics are bashing movie for having 'whitewashed' everything. Trust me, I am a big fan of the anime and this movie was done incredibly well. Go watch it with an open mind.

rebeccalucy,Just okay...,04/10,17-Nov-17,"Never seen the anime but apparently it really doesn't hold up in comparison. I thought it was okay but nothing special. I loved the design of Ryuk, it was a great CGI version of the animated character. It was both terrifying and fun to look at, one of the best visuals in the whole film. Willem Dafoe gave a convincing and mischievous version of Ryuk, definitely the best part of the film. I also enjoyed Keith Stanfield, he managed to perform very well with just his eyes. Some of the music ruins scenes, being too prominent in the film. Some of the other actors feel a bit dull compared to Dafoe and Stanfield, or a just serviceable. I hear the plot has been changed quite a lot from the anime, which really shows in the film. I feel they should have made either two parts or made a live action series instead. Overall, another one and done film.

Acting was Great and they definitely picked the right people for the roles. I wish they had more gore but whatever maybe if they make another one! 2 thumbs up! This is a movie you can't really compare it to the anime.

TheConnoisseurReviews,It's not that Bad,05/10,05-Oct-17,"The first thing we have to realize is that Netflix's ""Death Note"" isn't the original show. It isn't a retelling of the events of the anime with real people. In fact, it's more of a re-imaging, which makes this film its own story with characters only simply sharing some names. And honestly, being its own thing goes in the films favor as now we don't have to constantly compare it to the original. However, that doesn't make it a good movie.Netflix's ""Death Note"" isn't a bad movie, but it isn't necessarily a good movie either. It's somewhere in the middle, but it is watchable and can be enjoyable at some points. The biggest issue of the film is time, this is a movie that could have benefited from an extra 30-40 mins to the run time to flesh out the story and characters. Many scenes and events feel very rushed and the editing can be a bit choppy so the eventual build up to the finale feels a bit underwhelming and if you're not familiar with the basic lore of the Death Note itself, it can be hard to wrap your head around some of its powers and rules. The characters are fine, but like I said, more time could have helped flesh them out and clear up some of their motives. Light Turner played by Nat Wolff is a decent protagonist and much more different than his anime counterpart. He's still a genius, but he's more timid and not the most popular person at his school. He doesn't have an ego or god complex, but he has more of a moral dilemma of whether to use the Death Note or not. There's a good foundation here that could have been explored more. L played by Lakeith Stanfield again is a decent character and plays well against Light. He's still quirky and confident, but he has his own moral dilemmas that make him more relatable. But again, his relationship with light and his own character arc suffers because of the lack of development. Ryuk voiced by Willem Dafoe is the strongest character. He doesn't do to much but Defoe voices him perfectly giving him a demonic and ominous presence and I really like the decision of the filmmakers to keep him in the shadows and more of an observer than an active participant to the story. All the other characters are good characters on paper, but because of the short run time they don't get the attention and development they need to be compelling, but I'll say a couple decisions did surprise me. The dark direction and tone are great and suit a movie that's about a notebook that can kill anyone at any given time. There are some great scenes that really add tension and build on Light and L's relationship, such as the cafe scene from the trailers. The last act is actually extremely well done and really the saving grace of the film as it highlights everything the movie is trying to say and achieve. It's something straight from the anime with clever directing, writing, and editing. Like stated before, the impact could have been stronger and more compelling, if it gave us a bit more time to explore the world. Overall, ""Death Note"" isn't a good movie, but it's definitely not a bad movie. There's a lot of potential, but because of the decision to keep the movie short, it can come off as a bit choppy and underdeveloped. However, the movie goes by at a brisk pace and I wasn't ever bored. Sure there are moments that are cringeworthy, but there is just enough to keep viewers invested and interested to at least make it to the conclusion, which is well worth it. I give it a middle of the road review, a high 2.5/5"
owensknick,Review for those that don't care/won't watch the anime,02/10,27-Aug-17,"Reviewing based only off of the film and not the manga, as I knew it existed, but didn't get a chance to go through it.....The movie is absolutely screwed up due to two things. One, they insisted on maintaining hints of a Japanese based story which just came across as silly and out of place in the americanized film. Just little things that would make sense in an anime, but not a live action western film.And secondly, they tried to make a pie, with the ingredients of a cake. Had they one-offed the manga, it would have worked. Had they made a separate movie, it would have worked. But instead you have a separate story that is then contorted and forced to try to fit within the confines of a few select pillars from the source material. Leaving you with a broken and confusing story that you can tell (even just looking at it as a film and not an adaptation) has something wrong and almost feels like there's pages missing or that two plots were smashed together. For example, the entirety of the characters that are L and Ryuk are never explained. They each continue to do things throughout the film that have zero explanation or basis in sound reason.So, with that, is it watchable, sure. The camera and editing are fine. But the story, EVEN HAVING NOT GONE THROUGH THE ORIGINAL, is still an absolute disaster."
sarahemonah,They changed all the good parts,01/10,02-Sep-17,"An average rating of 4.7 is rather generous simply, as I personally think that this adaptation is just rubbish. All the characters have changed so much that there is no point of even giving them similar names to the original as Ryuk is too involved in the events, Light is kind of slow and is not intelligent or attractive enough, and Mia is nothing like Misa. Unfortunately I cannot even comment on L because I couldn't even get halfway through this film. If they had no intention of making this as interesting and entertaining as the original story and the characters so different, then why even calling it death note in the first place?

TheNameBrand,Underwater America Deathnote,02/10,01-Jun-18,"It's like some guy told his buddy the plot of the Death Note manga/anime, then that guy told a guy underwater. It's a real disgrace to the IP. I could see it being ""What if Death Note happened in America: the Film"" but even then, it's not cinematically good. Do yourself a favor and watch or read the original content, don't even touch this with a ten foot pole. I did it so you don't have to. Not even fun to watch just to make fun of

ni6hant,Watch the original series.,01/10,14-Apr-18,"Worst waste of time. Anyone who's not actually seen the original series and watched this will get such a bad idea about Death Note.Places where the actual mind-games would happen were either removed or made really dumb. Every character's personality has been changed, and not at all in a good way.

I love the anime series and everything that i loved in the anime had been taken away in this movie. The super smart lead characters, the clever rules of the deathbook and the relationship with Ryuk is all gone in the movie.I do see why they would want to do this movie since it could have been very good and MABY, i say a big maby, its a good film for those ho have not seen the anime or read the manga but for us ho have its unfortunately a waste of time :( I do have to say that i love William Dafoes voice as Ryuk. That did feel like it was straight from the anime :)

There is not one good thing to say about this movie . They changed the characters and plot so much im wondering why they even bothered using the names of the original characters .
There is so many flaws with this movie I could write an entire book about it all I can say is WARNING: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE

LUGST3R,People need to calm down,06/10,27-Aug-17,"As I write this review, the movie holds a 4.8/10. I feel inclined to write this review as I feel as though people need to stop throwing out 1/10 reviews, as that would suggest that this film is broken and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, which is simply not the case. If I had to give this film an exact score, I would give it a 6.5/10, as although I am sticking up for it, I can admit that it does have a fair amount of flaws.Also, before I go into positive and negatives, I would like to also point out that I have seen the anime TV series, which although I enjoyed it, I believe that it is also has its flaws (e.g. so much unnecessary exposition, loses a lot of steam when it jumps forward in time) and that fans need to stop holding it up as some untouchable 10/10 TV series.Things that I believe were done well: -The cinematographer and visuals were all well done, which you would have expected given the budget -Ryuk looked and sounded great. I've seen complaints about how he is underused, but I believe that because he was kept quite minimal, the creepiness surrounding his character remained throughout -L. The performance from Lakeith Stanfield was great, just as good as he was in Get Out -Some scenes were very well done, for example, the falling scene (shown in the trailer) and the end reveal. -The fact they didn't just copy the anime, and tried to make it their own thing.Also, the concept of the Death Note is amazing, although can't obviously give this movie credit for that, it just makes the movie not a 1/10 as they have this clever concept to work with and they would have to really mess up to no longer make it a clever concept, which they didn't.Things that I believe were OK: -The performance of Nat Wolff as Light. I believe he played his role...fine. Considering the budget, maybe they could have got someone better. But he did not ruin the movie (although wasn't the biggest fan of his over-the-top laugh, did not think that fit live-action very well) -The music. I really liked the music, but I didn't always think it fit the moment -The relationship between Light and Mia. They were OK together, just could have had a bit more time to flesh out their relationship a bit moreThings I believe could have been better: -The character of Mia. I think the acting was fine, but the character was pretty all over the place, changing personality to fit the situation -The montage sequence when he starts his killing and the response of the police/L. Shouldn't have been a quick montage -The run time. The movie should have been at least 2 hours, and should have fleshed out characters more, particular that of Mia -Light is way too trusting of Mia way too quickly -We could have found out more about the character of RyukNitpick: -The teacher at the start being overly horrible. Reminded me of the start of Fant4stic Four when the teacher is just being a savage to Reed when he's a kid...just whyIf you didn't enjoy this movie, fair enough, however, it's not 1/10 Birdemic/Emoji Movie level of bad."
someokiedude,*sigh* Just read the manga and watch the anime. It's for your own good.,02/10,30-Dec-20,"I really don't think that I have anything of worth to say about this movie. Krimson Rogue, Amanda the Jedi, and Cosmonaut Variety Hour have already done full on reviews of this movie, they picked apart every little thing that was wrong with it, and I don't think that there's anything that I could add to it. Willem Dafoe is a pretty inspired choice for Ryuk, and he's really good in the movie, but asides from that this film was nonsensical, pretentious, and an unintentionally hilarious disaster of a film.If I could give any advice for anyone who may think this could be an interesting take on the Death Note story. I'd just tell them to read the manga, watch the original anime, and then avoid all of the rest.

annique-83019,Incredibly lacking and superficial,02/10,30-Aug-17,"I cannot say how in depth the writers went when investigating source material. I'm not sure they did any research beyond Wikipedia. If they did it seems what they got out of the story is who decides who deserves to die? Take a bright outcast teenager who is desperate for the emo-girl, and give him power over death. Although there wasn't any real indicators of his extraordinary intelligence in the movie until maybe the very end. Our hero whines, loses his cool, and seems to have no control over incidents spiraling out of control. This story engenders no emotions, whereas even my teenage son cried (and he is not a crier) when he watched the Japanese animation. I've heard they're looking at a second movie, but you really need to hook people with the first movie. ""Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely."" That's the quote that explains what makes Death Note so incredible (anime, not Japanese or American movie) Light has an ironclad will, extraordinary intelligence, and a strong moral code. Things do not spiral out of control because of his powerlessness. Of course Ryuk isn't an angel, but at no time is Light a push over. Viewers who cheer for the young man with the strength to make society better, start to pray for his redemption as his focus narrows to the point that he becomes a soulless monster. It's emotionally wrenching, and it's a shame this movie never came close to that depth until a tiny glimpse at the very end."
aawbloomstone,Death Note; Netflix Originals Shameful Attempt.,01/10,27-Aug-17,"I cannot say that I have written reviews for other movies or TV series of the type in the past, but I felt compelled to write one for the new recently released Death Note movie by Netflix Originals. I first want to begin by not slandering Netflix as an inept company. I have been watching Netflix for several years, as by many other people in the world. As Netflix became more expanded and had the freedom to make their own personal movies and TV series, it has become almost a phenomenon with personal fandom. I personally enjoyed Netflix Originals not just through live action series, but also some of their anime series as well.With that said, Netflix and their attempt to recreate a popular anime series (Death Note) as a live action movie was not by any means of resourceful, innovative, or of quality. Months prior to its release, I waited months after the revealing of the trailers. I cannot begin of how much I have enjoyed the anime series Death Note. Not to be subjective, but it is one of my personal favorites in anime series. The story and plot from the anime Death Note series is an almost an ineffable story. The cunning, deviousness, and intelligent characters throughout this fantasy story is absent. Netflix unfortunately could not capture this indistinguishable fantasy. I would like to mention some of my personal negative critiques: The characters did not resemble of the anime series through their actions and behaviors (Specifically speaking Light, L, and Ryuk), too much and unnecessary gore, and the competition between Light and L of wiles was not present. Some positive personal perspectives: Ryuk played by Willem Dafoe in terms of voice and very over generally speaking, character, was spot on. L's intelligence was present during some, but insignificant, moments relating to events from the anime series, and the power of the Death Note for the most part was still intact from the anime series, even though some was overexagerated.I want to end this review by saying that I have confidence that Netflix and Netflix Originals will learn from the mistakes that were partaken during this film. And possibly try again. Also, to keep in mind Netflix will still be viewed and continue to make their own films for our enjoyment."
binthaider-755-822849,"Such potential, such a disappointment.",01/10,13-Oct-18,"The actor L and the character L were as pathetic as each other. L is meant to be the youngest best detective in the world but he just comes across as a melodramiatic, childish idiot; which makes it almost comical. I just couldnt like either one of them. Couldn't take anything in this movie seriously! Overacting, unlikeable characters, wierdly scripted lines. The whole thing was just a waste."
pinkpink_1217,An utterly flat and empty adaptation of the much loved Japanese comic series,04/10,26-Aug-17,"As another endeavor from the Hollywood to create a movie out of an iconic, much loved and cherished Japanese animation / comic series with an enthusiastic, loyal fan base, Death note has bathed in skepticism and pessimism before it becomes available to the world. With the western setting and the emphasis from the production that the movie would be loosely based on the animation / comic series, it is bound to spark disapproval, especially among those who have enjoyed and loved the original. Fortunately, without having previously watched the original series, I consider myself a blank page that is good to go to enjoy the movie without the risk of bias. Unfortunately, Death Note turns out to be yet another proof of the skepticism surrounding Hollywood adaptations being absolutely correct. The problem with these Hollywood adaptations is that, they cannot just simply pick up whichever pieces they find interesting and useful from the original, throwing away the rest of the complicated and difficult bundle, and call it a day. No. In order to produce a triumphant 'loosely based' adaptation, there must be some elements of originality added to create an exciting and refreshing take of the original story line. Death note is, however, anything but exciting and refreshing, leaving the audience frustrated by its lack of sincerity. The movie seems like a sloppy version which tries its hardest in avoiding any direction that requires originality or creativity. But even if not judged as an adaptation but as a movie alone, Death Note has a fatal problem of not producing any, yes, ANY likable and colorful character. The movie never takes its time to introduce the characters, giving the audience only a few scarce pieces of information that make them struggle to feel any connection with them. The only character the audience can sympathize with, is perhaps Light Turner, the death-note-owning protagonist, as we learn his upsetting reasons for his strong desire for justice and his struggles between choosing the right and wrong as the story unfolds. However, the other characters in the movie are, if not unlikable, at least uninteresting and confusing. Even L, supposedly the mysterious, intriguing and extremely intelligent detective, falls as the victim of character underdevelopment and unconvincing dialogue, and loses his charm. Misa, as Light's girlfriend / partner in crime, is probably the number one unlikable character in the whole movie, as she swifts from the endearing sweetheart to the mindless and manipulative murderer caught in her obsession with maintaining the reputation and popularity of the Kira (the pseudo name Light uses to kill people using his death note). After all, Death Note definitely fails to deliver an enjoyable and memorable adaptation of the acclaimed animation / comic series."
walterfeliu,the reality,01/10,27-Aug-17,"The movie may entertain you, however, is no way near the anime, the anime is an ice cream on a summer day while this movie is just cup noodles after having a week of only that, cup noodles... the movie have a poor character development, the characters are a joke, a bad one they just don't match the anime, its just a poor movie that I wish never came out because all it does is throw down the name of Death Note. I highly encourage you to watch the Japanese version of death note the movie it is a million times better than this Netflix crap, don't get me wrong I love Netflix exclusives like Okja or stranger thing, but this movie is just a waste of time... hold yourself from watching it, go for the Japanese version or the excellent anime, trust me, you wont regret it.

mushiki-59696,This adaptation is terrible,02/10,26-Aug-17,"I was truly OK with the Hollywood adaptation of ghost in the shell, it wasn't perfect but it was damn good.But death note? this movie? it just gets almost every damn thing wrong, its not an adaptation its a mediocre teen movie with the name ""death note""Well, Ryuk was still cool, probably thanks to Willem Dafoe.

prince-tenshi-yuki,A total disappointment,01/10,25-Aug-17,"The worst movie on Netflix, right now. It is comparable to Dragon Ball Evolution... Bad acting, no emotions, not getting the character's personality right... Everything is mixed up.. The movie is a total disappointment.If you want to watch Death Note, watch the anime. Even the three movie of Death Note made in Japan were better than this on.

charlosierra,Overall awesome and on the edge of your seat movie!,10/10,25-Aug-17,"I have never heard of this until Netflix and with that said I can't make a comparison between the animation version and this one. However, I will say this,it was overall a great movie. The acting was good and I'm hoping Netflix does a sequel. It had action, drama, horror, romance, and suspense, a all in one movie. I was literally on the edge of my seat for some parts. I loved the death God, the costume and the actor kept me watching all the way until the end. Overall, great job and hope for Death Note 2.

jrcrai,death nots review,01/10,03-Sep-17,"To be honest its nothing comparing to the original death note series and movies. The difference with this movie its a complete knock off the original at the same time the worst the characters personality is the opposite light seems like weak character. The storyline is not that interesting at all except the fact that movie just a Hollywood version.Did not enjoy the movie that much as the original Japanese anime series and movie. Disappointed the way they viewed the character and the story it self. The movie is disappointing like what happened with ghost in the shell. I would say to the new viewers this movie might be appealing but not to the fans.

vinesauce,Better than it has any right to be.,07/10,26-Aug-17,"If your first instinct is to bolt when seeing a positive Death Note review- stay with me for just a minute. I did not want to like this film, not after almost every critic under the sun roughly describing it as ""white-washed piece of garbage"". The white-washing part is very much true, which is why I'm never going to give this film a full star rating.What came as an absolute surprise to me however is how visually stunning, cleverly written and just straight up fun this movie is. It has its flaws and silly moments, but they all feel very self aware which makes this movie incredibly fun if you make the right choice to not take it too seriously. The endless debate of what a good remake should look like continues: Should it be close to the original, should it bring new things? To me personally, Netflix's Death Note finds the right balance. Not a lot of people are gonna like how many new things the movie introduced and how much they've changed, but its extremely impressive that this works as a standalone movie. Overall, from the pacing to the cast- this is a memorable, visually satisfying, flawed and thoroughly entertaining film. Go into this with an open mind and build your own opinion- you might just be pleasantly surprised."
ario-34119,Promising start with terrible ending,04/10,16-Feb-18,"I've read some reviews before writing one myself and as predicted, all reviews (that I've read, there were 800-something at this time) were comparing this to the original.Watching (and disappointed by) a few adaptations before this, I knew that was the last thing I should do, so I didn't. I tried to forget everything I knew about the original and watched this as something totally new. And they did, make this something entirely new, I mean. The storyline is totally different than the original. Only the basic story and characters were kept.They started it nicely, although it did feel a bit rushed. Some character fleshing out would've been nice and some detailed early killings would be good before reaching the 400 marks. But, it wasn't bad, really, up to this point.Then, came the bad parts:
1. L showed up and the guy should've kept his mask on for the entire movie. His acting was awful and made the character totally unbelievable and unrelatable. I half blamed the writer for this. As they changed the storyline, why would they try to keep the trait of the original character? And did it half-heartedly at that. I'd say keep the name only and create a totally new character (that would be easier to act out.) The character trait wasn't correlated to the story anyway.2. Plot holes:
Why would Light think Mia would be able to see Ryuk by touching the book? There was never any explanation or even indication to suggest that.And it turned out that she couldn't. Ryuk explained that only the owner of the book could see him. Which in turn, made a bigger plot hole. As Mia couldn't even see Ryuk for not being the owner, how could she kill anyone by writing on the book?More plot hole regarding that, the fisherman could also kill people despite the fact that the book still belonged to Light. Was that the rule now? ANYONE, without having to own the book, could kill by writing on it? They just couldn't see Ryuk? Well, they could do that, it's a new story anyway, but it felt like a weak rationalization to me. The ability to kill people should be a bigger responsibility than the ability to see Ryuk.The instruction on the book was supposed to be very specific. Yet you see Watari being ordered around like a mind controlled zombie by Light, which shouldn't have happened.3. The promising start wasn't followed through due to bad writing. Even disregarding the original, we saw L introduced clearly to be intended as a worthy opponent. Yet he turned out to be totally useless. I meant that literally. The story was developing without him towards the end.4. You had a unique and tought provoking concept, you had to be prepared to create a good ending. Yet the ending was terrible beyond belief. The ""greatest detective"" was useless, it was never clear whether the main character became good or evil, tough or pussy?In the end, you don't need to compare it to the original to give this film a bad review. They had the chance to make it good by changing the story altogether, but didn't follow through. I gave it 4 stars because of the promising start, quite okay direction and Defoe."
SomaQuest,A Sub-Par Representation of Original,03/10,08-Oct-18,"There is nothing salvageable from this film in regards to the concept of ""Death Note."" A poorly written story with only the overriding concept of the original in place. I am convinced that the actors in this film came directly from acting school graduation to start filming; and I am very disappointed in Wilem Defoe who signed up for this monstrosity - he obviously owed a gambling debt and needed some quick cash. That being said, he still phoned in this film.Halfway through the film I found myself wanting to turn it off, but since it was a recommendation from my 12 year old son I gave it a go; It wasn't worth the extra time and effort I wasted - the final quarter of the movie was the most poorly constructed of all. If you take anything from this review keep this in mind; don't see this version of ""Death Note,"" the original Anime is the suggested route."
ceasarhydra,Netflix ruined it,02/10,27-Aug-17,"Death Note the movie is nothing like the anime. They ruined every character in the anime. Lights girlfriend wasn't even in the anime and it was a dumb decision to put her in the movie. L and Light were both reckless and stupid in the movie while in the anime they're smart and think about every step they take and every outcome it'll have. Ryuk seemed to hate Light while in the anime Ryuk is neutral in almost every situation. They did a poor job in trying to make the anime into the movie and basically ruined every chance they had to make this a good movie. It was all over the place and I think most people that haven't watched the anime don't know what's going on. It skips multiple episodes in the anime every time its another scene. I think they shouldn't try to recreate any series or anime's in the future or if they're planning to do so at least make it exactly like the series/anime with similar characters, similar personalities and similar plots."
HakuMashentay,Thought it was better than I expected,04/10,02-Jan-23,"Agree this was rushed and some things just did not make sense, lights girly screams really made me laugh, thought creatively they added their own twists and it was good what they added. It was not horrible but it also was not great.Decent effort but could have been so much more.They could have completely flipped the storyline which is what I would have done but chose to keep the main story line.Acting is so so, l is annoying, light was not really flushed out and neither was his girlfriend.It was just a fast forward of the anime with bits changed.I would not give this a 1 as so many have, it's watchable and decent, would I watch it again, No."
olovsimonsson,Without comparing to the Manga,06/10,19-Jan-18,"I've never read the manga or seen any of the Japanese adaptations. Thus, I will not go on about how this was an insult to the source material. It may have been, but I wouldn't know. Fine it's not a fantastic movie. But on the other hand it's not as bad as many of the Death Note fans claim. The story is intriguing, although they do not delve deeply enough into the psychology as they could have. Possession of a book that gives you the power to kill, only by knowing the face and name of the potential victim, would do a lot of things to a persons mind. Such seems not to be the case in this film. The casting is not great. Willem Dafoe is great, as always, but the rest are doing what they can with a script that clearly does not allow for them to show their potential.I think the biggest issue I have with this is that it comes across that it is based on something much longer and complicated, and that the Manga tone is still in it. It should have been longer, and if it had to be made American, they should have gone all in, and removed the Manga influences. It is a strange blend that does not fully make sense. I get that they wanted to pay homage to the original source, but it does not do anything good for this movie. With that said, I did watch it with some interest, and I don't feel sorry I did. And if nothing else, it made me interested in the Japanese original, and that's not a bad thing, right?"
nmn34,Not a Fan,02/10,17-Sep-17,"This movie was tone deaf towards its source and is disappointing in how it treats the characters, instead replacing the cerebral game of cat and mouse with crap music and gore. The end result is a soulless film in which the main character lack agency and at the whims of evil forces. It is so contrarian to the original manga and series that it is perfectly acceptable to call it its antithesis.Light is a weak character. Given full authority over the mortal coil, he lacks the conviction to wield it appropriately. Instead, he is manipulated by those around him, by Ryuk and by Mia, creating a domino effect that feels like an attempt to wave all responsibility from him rather than to tell a compelling story. Ryuk is the one hat gets him to use the Death Note while Mia goads him on. Light in the source material is a Macbethan character, altruistic at first but is consumed by his own power. Ryuk merely facilitates his power to watch what would happen and Mia a fool headed but willing pawn smitten more by the image of Kira rather being ignorant of the malevolence growing beneath him. They build him up while their movie counterparts act more as a shield. The fact that they take the blame off of him changes the entire dynamic of the story, one where naive idealism has no risks and all rewards. While the original would oppose such a sentiment, this is a movie that supports the its okay to punch Nazis narrative, all the while ignoring that in doing so, one becomes the Nazi.L is black, this actually has some unforeseen consequences to he character's appearance. Stanfield has the mannerisms down, he candy obsession, the poor sleeping habits and the posture, but they don't reflect on his appearance all that much. His hair is too short to look unkempt, he lacks the bags beneath his eyes, and his skin lacks the sickly pallor of his original. Cosmetically, he doesn't look like the reclusive super genius investigator, so they just made him no longer a recluse. He is introduced studying a Death Note murder scene first hand, exiting in full view of the police with only a half mask and hoodie to conceal himself. Hardly the mystique of a laptop with an L on the screen. But this is a rather small disappointment compared to the big fault of his role in the movie. He has no one to play off of. What gave him the amazing intellect in the original was his deliberation skills, he listens to his team and from their ideas deduces the correct answers. How the Death Note seems to operate, the identity of Kira, the introduction of new, unknown players, he is a master at weeding out the wrong to get to the only reasonable, if illogical, conclusion. Stanfield has no one, only Light's father to work with and seems too flippant with how he comes to his conclusions. It makes his every action look like a wild guess rather than a calculated risk and some post action explanation does little to cover for him. So the end result is a watered down Kira plays checkers with a less than impressive L.And the person who chose the soundtrack to this movie needs to be beaten with an oar and shot."
morganvandenreydt,"A sloppily written, poorly executed 'loose adaptation' of excellent source material",01/10,30-Aug-17,"Honestly, really not worth your time. I understand people wanting to give this movie the benefit of the doubt, but this movie was littered with plot holes, sloppy writing and painful aesthetic choices to try and look cool. An example: Light has to figure out L's name and does so through controlling Watari's actions with the Death Note. Seems legit, except for Watari not being a full name at all. Like L, Watari is a code name. Not to mention Watari being the only white person in the manga, but the movie makes him Japanese just so he can get a thick Japanese accent. This movie's a great example of what happens when no one (except for the guy who played L) loves or even respects the material they're basing their cheap cash-grab of a movie on."

luke-eberhardt,An Underwhelming and Poor Americanized Adaptation of a Brilliant Manga Series,04/10,26-Oct-17,"9 years ago, I read the 'Death Note' manga, which then turned into an obsession I've maintained over that year alone. Even today I look back at it with such enthusiasm and nostalgia, as I don't think there's been a better manga series that's captivated me that much. Sure enough, the more recognized anime adaptation was good in an adaptation sense of the manga, though despite its few flaws I admired it mostly for its visual and audible queues. Add to that, I even heavily enjoyed the live action 'Death Note' films, which were all very respectable to the source material, I felt it didn't even have to use it as a crutch for the most part, except be 'its own thing' as an adaptation should be.Now We have an Americanized adaptation, my expectations for this film adaptation were incredibly low to say the very least. Director Adam Wingard shows he has a clear vision for his film adaptation, though for the most part it feels incredibly underwhelming, especially at how complex and investing the original Death Note manga and anime were. It's eventually reduced to being subjugated by plenty of petty little American tropes, campy cringe-worthy horror clichés and an annoying romantic subplot followed by plenty of over- dramatic moments and terrible soundtrack choices that doesn't compensate to the original source material. Performances from the actors were sub-par to say the very least, nothing too special or even broadly appealing to fans and non-fans alike. Wilhelm Dafoe however, is excellent unsurprisingly as Ryuk the Shinigami; it's another one of those rare cases where you have a small element in the film worth seeing even with what little he had to work with.Other than that, the film just wasn't that good at all, I'll give credit to the cinematography looking sleek and stylish, though in this film's Americanization it's losing the compelling and complex edge that made the source material amazing in the first place. It's all too easy to say it's overall; an underwhelming adaptation as it's an underwhelming film, I wasn't too surprised given the odd approach and the questionable choices to the various changes this film made in terms to the source material. Sadly, it doesn't stack up at all except upon scratching the surface and not digging deep enough."

parsonm2,Entertaining Worth a Look,06/10,12-Mar-18,"Let me begin by saying I was very caught off guard by this. I thought this was going to be a poor quality simplistic horror flick. It's actually a high quality production and despite the fact that you know the basic premise, it's pretty entertaining and does more than you might expect with the story. If the premise of the story appeals to you, you'll probably enjoy it. It's not scary but it is entertaining. Basically it's about a magic notebook with it's own demon overseer who kills anyone whose name is put in it by the current owner. It's a dark genie tale. Personally, I would have liked the story to omit the detective aspect of the character ""L"" but this is still very much worth a watch and has some clever aspects to the story.

dragonroars-57812,This is what the FANS asked for...,04/10,26-Aug-17,"Take away the previous remakes of the manga and anime you still have a poorly made horror movie without any motivation. In short, this version of Deathnote is a poor horror/psychological thriller, even if there wasn't an original story. So with that said, the movie, acting, dialog, all just fell flat.Now let's discuss what did work; Casting William Dafoe was probably the best thing this movie did right. However, there wasn't enough scenes or interaction with Ryuk. Instead they had a mere handful.The rest of the movie was a rushed teen romance, full of random rampages. There was no moral quandary, no thick plot of how to outwit the adversary, and it would have been better to sticking with criminal victims at first but the first victim is just a bully nothing more. About the vast difference of this version or retelling of Deathnote to the others. Do you know how many times I have heard fans say how awesome it would be to spend a lot of money on a Hollywood budget movie? Yes, I have been around the conventions circuits and I would know better than to make a reboot of anything with such an oddball fan base. The fans of the genre can't agree on anything just starting with watching something dubbed or subbed. It gets real messy when you start asking if they like anime or live action.As for NetFlix who produced this flop and fizzle. Well I cannot blame them 100%, the viewer reviews on many of the Asian movies are rated low just because they didn't ""speak American"". I have watched many quality Chinese, Korean, and Japanese movies rated 2 stars just because you need to turn on the subtitles. Oh, you poor baby, now you have to learn to read English.This is what the FANS asked for... at least some of the lazy ones."
bigeddogg47,this was a huge let down don't bother,01/10,06-Sep-17,"I had high hopes that the live action version would be halfway decent based on the trailers, but at last I was very disappointed. It really doesn't follow the source material at all, this movie is so rushed that it doesn't even set up the characters at all to guild the movies plot they are just thrown together for ""reasons"" I guess would be the best way to describe it. the main character ""Light"" is suppose to be intelligent and charismatic but in this live action adaptation he is an idiot and a loner which would work if the acting was even remotely passable, only Willem Dafoe comes out as always looking brilliant for his part its unfortunate that he had to work with such a really poor story and cast."
topherckelly,Never Seen the Anime version,08/10,09-Sep-17,"OK here's the deal, I've never seen the anime version. So I have no bias at all. I had no idea what the movie was about before watching it on Netflix. All I knew was what I saw on the trailer, which to me seemed super cheesy. Im glad I watched it though! It was very entertaining to me.Here are some things I liked about it: the acting was good, no complaints there. Ryuk looked awesome, super creepy and definitely a step up from the cheesy CGI version of the Japanese live action film. Good solid story line, it definitely wasn't what I expected, and although the ending was predictable, the film did keep me on the edge of my seat throughout. Keep this in mind, this is an Americanized version of a Japanese cartoon. So of course there's going to be a teen romance story and overly gruesome deaths. This should be a surprise to nobody, so get over it.If you love the Anime version, just don't watch this movie, because you'll complain and ruin it for the the rest of us. Remember, the majority of adults in America don't watch Anime. So please, let people enjoy this movie - like I did. My opinion is one of many - you may totally disagree but thats OK!"
anatolefiorito,Absolutely fine Adaption,10/10,23-Apr-19,"Don't listen to the other reviewers who trash this movie they don't have an open mind like me. Despite what the movie lacks it does hold true to the original show. It's worth a shot if you like the show and wanna give the movie a chance. It was worth it for me.*Update* Oh sorry maybe its because i prefer live action to anime any day. im not an anime person anymore. so yeah this version is way better than the original show

gatheringsnow,Take a Potato Chip...And Eat It!,01/10,23-Mar-18,"The aforementioned phrase written above is quite possibly the most quoted phrase from fans of the original anime series and possibly manga (I don't know because I've never read it) that perfectly sums up the overall vibe of this pathetic excuse for an adaptation. It fails as a standalone film but it's an abomination in regards to the source material, in so many ways it can't possibly be summed up in a single review like this.But to get to the point, the reason why I compared the film to the famous ""potato chip"" scene is because both the scene and the film itself are at their core very similar, the scene is a prime example of how the anime tries to be overwhelming epic and tense at times for no discernible reason expect it wants to stand out and be bold and daring, which it is, but not always in a good way, or at least how it intends. Overall, the anime has more hits than misses in that field.The entire ""Death Note"" movie directed by Adam Wingard is in essence that one scene stretched out to a full length film, in that it tries to be overwhelmingly dark and gritty and thrilling to the point where it becomes a parody of itself and ultimately leads to ruin. The anime was dark and tense but could also be charming, light-hearted, amusing, and even hilarious at times, with all of the multi-faceted characters working extremely well off of each other, playing on their opponents strengths and weaknesses and using them to their advantage. It was smart and clever, but only occasionally got to full itself, much like the main character of the series, the doomed anti-hero Light Yagami (sorry, Light Turner).But the movie tries to be so overly-mature with graphic violence, swearing, and sex that it ultimately loses sight of what made the original so great, it didn't need heavy bombastic fight sequences, endless angst and violence and heavy drama to be good, it could be subtle and clever all without resorting to any of that, and so it's such a disappointment to see how much was truly lost in translation, as if that sort of story could not work in an American or at least Western setting. Like the original source material, the story is universal, feeling much more like an epic Shakespearean tragedy at times than a comic originally in Shonen Jump, a demographic for teenage boys who are used to stuff like Naruto and One Piece. A true shame, it could have been a shining light to stand, no pun intended, but instead it sunk to the very bottom of the barrel."
andrew_osaka,Completely fails on almost every level,03/10,25-Aug-17,"I want to start this review off by pointing out that I haven't watched the original anime in well over 7 years, and went into this with low expectations, but tried to keep an open mind. I'll start off with the little glimpses of good that I found. Willem Dafoe as Ryuk was top notch. Ryuk looked fantastic and gave off the right atmosphere, he sounded perfect and gave a performance that did the original series justice. Aside from Ryuk, there were a few faithful parts (Watari giving out ice cream) that came across well and worked. But the positives end here. Light and Mia were atrocious and almost backwards. Light, who should be a bright, charming and popular guy is instead an impulsive angsty teen who in no way would be capable of the mastermind qualities they try to emulate from the anime. And in fact, Mia, who should be a ditsy fashion model who is obsessed with Light actually comes across as the more intelligent and sociopathic of the two. even ignoring how unfaithful they were adapted, they are unlike-able and their romance is forced. L is done better, but not by much. Instead of being a cold, calculating genius, just comes across as a slightly socially awkward. he figits around, avoids eye contact, gets frustrated easily, and gets overly emotional over things. All of these qualities are the opposite of the original character. The plot feels like it goes nowhere, yet feels rushed at the same time, and the best elements from the anime are painfully absent. The rivalry between Light and L doesn't come across nearly as well. The battle of minds between genius' trying to outmaneuver each other doesn't work when neither of them come across as intelligent. L and Light's calculated moves replaced with emotional reactions trying to just off each other as quickly as possible. And from this stems the biggest issue, neither of the main characters are likable, and neither of them make sense. Light is overly emotional and makes a ton of mistakes constantly and is out for revenge and to impress his girlfriend, while L just doesn't have any of his iconic scenes to show his character. You end up not rooting for either and not caring who comes out on top or how they play off of each other because it's done so badly. I give it a 3 only because Ryuk was done well and that needs recognised. Do yourself a favour and just watch the anime, or at the very least, the Japanese film which at least had the character look and act the part."
tyleramato-28680,Adam Wingard...what happened?!,03/10,26-Sep-17,"""Death Note"" based off of the anime, manga of the same name joins the long list of controversially Whitewashed adaptations churned out by the film business, but let's get into the real problems with Netflix, Adam Wingard's take on the popular anime, manga. ""Death Note"" is a bland, poorly paced, poorly directed, poorly acted, and most importantly very, very stupid movie, and that's not a knock on the original material because well, I haven't seen it. (also, it's an anime) Since putting out two very good original films in ""You're Next"" and ""The Guest"", Adam Wingard has seem to have forgotten how to be a good director with his latest offerings in the form of ""Blair Witch"" and the movie I am talking about with you right now, this film should have been called ""Dutch Angles: The Movie"" because there are A LOT of them, it would make Michael Bay jealous, and the acting isn't much better. Nat Wolff as Light is just so bland and poorly written, there's nothing about him to like and his seamless willingness to take part in bringing death to criminals is not in the least convincing, same with his sadistic girlfriend played by Margaret Qualley, who goes from beautiful cheerleader to psychotic partner in crime in a heartbeat. Keith Stanfield is poorly cast as L whilst Willem Dafoe is perfect as the demon Ryuk. With better direction and a better script this could have at least been a quite decent film, the film also fails with its tone which is just all over the place, maybe if the film was taken in a less serious tone with a director like Edgar Wright or Taika Waititi, it could have been great."
josie-maria,Don't bother - watch the anime,01/10,30-Aug-17,"Absolutely horrible! If you find the story intriguing - watch the anime instead. This movie adaption comes with very flat and immensely annoying characters as well as bad acting. The great diversity and depth of characters such as Light, L and Ryuk are completely absent. The story of the death note is rather rushed and very ill-explained. I imagine it makes little sense if you don't know the anime.

bobandlulureview,Read the manga instead!,01/10,08-Apr-18,"Personally I don't watch live action movies based on Mangas, yet as it happened I was bored and at home and Netflix kept popping the movie in my 'recommendations' list. I thought, ""Oh... well... why not?"" I am never going to get those 101 minutes of my life ever again. I wasted my time. The movie was so boring I had to pause every 15 minutes and ask myself if I needed to subject myself to such self-inflicted mental agony. I kept on watching it anyway. I hate how Americans take something beautiful and manage to touch it and make complete trash out of it. It is at times like this, that I understand the cultural differences. Our way of praying and looking up to gods is reverent not just in prayer but also in action but with them it's just 'supernatural'. When a theme is so Asian, one needs to either adapt the story to suit the westerners or stick with the origins. The movie was a 'Na gharka, naghatka' genre.

Oh wait no, I Can't call this garbadge. That would be insulting garbadge. Even by itself it has so many things that don't make sense and are bad. I'd say skip this (and all netflix live-action remakes) and just watch the original.

I think the director did a lousy job and if I were his boss he would fire him right now. What the hell did he do? This is not Death Note. Death Note is more than a movie with a magic notebook.I will never watch Adam Wingard again.

nikhil-39604,A one-time watch if you ignore the source material,05/10,30-Oct-21,"This adaptation of the smash hit manga only follows its source material on the surface. Everything in the movie is completely changed (and Americanised?), with the standard Hollywood formula.If you watch the movie comparing it with the manga and even the anime (which I really loved), you will be outraged or heavily disappointed. I tried to set aside my expectations and watched the movie and reviewed it on its own merit. Sure, it did not have the mind-bending twists of the manga/anime. But what is shown is pretty good if a tad predictable. For me, it was a decent one-time watch on a lazy afternoon.TLDR - If you feel that this adaptation sucks and the manga/anime are far superior, you are right. But if you are able to ignore the source material and keep your expectations low, the movie is ok and worth a one-time watch.

drsbrigham,This movie made the third Matrix movie look not so bad after all.,01/10,25-Aug-17,"I have to say that most of the characters were really good. The biggest disappointment was the guy chosen to play Light Yagami. Nat Wolff is so not the kid for that part. There are many many others that could have done a better job. Not just because he lacks the personality that made Light Yagami very interesting, but also because he was just remembering lines( obviously). He was NOT living the character. He failed 100%. His stupid looks are not the reason. I mean granted you just feel like punching him in the face for being terribly annoying, but there are many actors that don't look great but have the personality to capture your attention. Jake Abel, Sam Calfin, or anyone like them could have been a much better choice. Also the girl that was with him( that doesn't exist in the real story) gave me the feeling a big ugly pimple does when I see it and wish it would just go away. Details were changed. And that was annoying. Next time, before a movie is made, I wish they pay better attention to how the characters act. Simply reciting the lines like a zombie not only kills the character and the story, but also the viewers."

SeakDub,"Not Needed Remake, Again.",01/10,07-Sep-17,"From beginning to end this movie went from a curious interest to straight up awful garbage. Understanding that this is Netflix's version and not based on the amazingly well done anime series. We know this isn't going to be exactly like the show, basically going into a whole new movie with just the same concept and plot. The movie starts cheesy and then it escalates into some pathetic movie. It turned out as horrible as ""The Last Airbender"" (2010) and ""Dragonball: Evolution"" (2009). Cramming too much material in a Hollywood movie never ends well.The characters in the anime Death Note, were intelligent, geniuses, a game of cat and mouse. Thrilling to watch the show. As for the movie it ended up having characters that were nowhere near being geniuses. Such a downfall since that is what made the anime beautiful to watch. Without the characters going one on one we get cry babies wanting to be the better baby. Followed by one of the greatest characters you love in the anime series, Ryuk(The Death God). In the movie, Ryuk is basically a bloodthirsty grease biker that is not likable. So besides Netflix destroying amazing characters they also managed to take out many other characters that made this flop even worse.The story fell apart. Anime was Kira and L fighting each other which made a true thriller. The movie we get is Light Turner who is a bullied kid who we can only guess is ""Smart."" He comes across the Death Note and gets peer pressured into using it. The Death Note has many rules, but we only get what helps move the movie along. Nothing else. And eventually it just turns into a bad romance love story. No special or element that gave this version its unique feel.Like the other movies listed here this movie ended up just being rushed, smashed way too much material in a short film. If Netflix decided to do a mini series, it may have had way better chances. But this movie had not one good thing about it. Even the music was so utterly bad. Only way to watch it is either laugh at how bad it is and have its own cult following. Or the other way(if you are an anime Death Note lover) then picture it like another person who just so happens to be named Light found the notebook and everyone involved is a spoiled baby that is no way related to the anime series.Still debating to watch it? One word, SKIP! Netflix took a good name and must use it for their gain to bring in watchers. But it isn't worth the time. Watch the anime, if you love that. Then go for the Japanese version of Death Note. Stay away from this movie."
sebijin,Watch or Read the original instead,02/10,13-Mar-18,"No.I love the original Death Note. A lot. I read the manga, I watched the anime, I even watched the 2015 Japanese Live Action Drama. All of those were great.This adaptation is awful.The only thing I enjoyed about it was the cinematography. Seriously, that's it.The acting was bad, with the only exception being Ryuk. William Defoe was great as Ryuk. The plot was simultaneously a deviation from the original, while still being the original. It was weird.What could have fixed it?If they hadn't tried to be so much like the original and instead, just did a story about the Death Note with different characters and a different plot, it would've been better. It wouldn't have been great, because Nat Wolff is a terrible actor, but it would've been at least good.If you've read/watched the original Death Note - don't watch this."
sdowen-59793,Poor adaption,01/10,18-Aug-21,"Both the story & the actors have been whitewashed. They turned Death Note into a cheap horror flick with none of the nuances of the original manga.There was no need to Americanize the film. Death Note doesn't work as a movie. If Netflix cared enough about the project, they would have developed a series to tell the story correctly.They ruin Light's character by using Ryuk to convince Light to use the Death Note to commit murder.Ryuk is an observer. He doesn't interfere with Light's decisions. Light is a highly intelligent sociopath. He doesn't need Ryuk guiding his decisions.The writers of this movie didn't care about the character or the story. They created a cheap stasher flick void of ant character development."
thedarkone-12368,"Rushed mess of special effects and ""The Room"" level acting",01/10,29-Aug-17,"I'm going to try to review this from a movie-goer's standpoint, rather than that of a longtime fan of the source material. It's like someone tried to make a supernatural detective drama with acting about on par with The Room. The plot is scattered and at times intangible, the characters have no depth and do nothing to draw the viewer's interest or sympathy. There is no real development of relationships between characters, which results in you feeling nothing over the many deaths throughout the film. Heavy handed visual effects taint even the tamest of scenes, making the actual viewing process a chore. The deaths each feel like something out of a Final Destination movie, and instead of dealing out suspense, the film just force-feeds the viewer gore for the sake of gore. Even Willem Dafoe's performance, which I wholeheartedly hoped would be the saving grace of this film, was unable to help my final verdict, as it was so dampered by the material he had to work with and the editing surrounding him, not to mention the poor quality of CGI. This movie was doomed for failure the moment it was announced, for the same reasons as The Last Airbender, and Dragonball Evolution. The stories these movies are based on are so successful because of the format they were originally produced in. Trying to cram an entire season of a deep, complicated story, into two hours (give or take), just doesn't work, much less an entire series into the same amount of time. Maybe one of these years Hollywood will learn to let the most successful franchises be, and not try to squeeze the last few bucks out of it at the cost of its soul -- but I sincerely doubt it. Now, that being said, I still highly recommend the original anime, whether you're a fan of anime or not. I'm not a big anime guy, but I still give the Death Note anime 10/10 stars."
milton_ng,Disappointing,03/10,26-Aug-17,"I was really looking forward to this movie as I loved the anime. Already going in, I only knew William Dafoe to play the demon. But within the first 30 seconds, the whole tone was off completely, showing slow motion of students with this music.I'm not sure why Hollywood keeps doing this, but man, adapt it with Asian actors! It's set in Japan, I know they won't film there but at least make Asian actors. The whole plot seemed so rushed, makes me question if the writers even watched the anime or not. They made L seem so messy. He wasn't that messy with candy everywhere. It's like the director told set decorator, just put candy everywhere, keep the frame busy'.Disappointing movie.

awesomeblebee,A huge disappointment,01/10,26-Aug-17,"As a huge fan of the anime, I believed the movie adaptation was worth watching. However, I was severely disappointed within the first five minutes. It does not follow the story whatsoever and the characters aren't how they should be. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the hard work of everyone involved with the movie, but come on. There are little to no similarities between the movie and the original which makes me question why they even bothered making this in the first place. Maybe if I was unfamiliar with the anime/manga, it wouldn't be too bad. But I'm pretty sure that most fans will agree with me when I say that this was a huge disappointment. The movie was well made, but poorly put together. Its plot and setting truly was its downfall. Personally, I would not recommend this movie to anyone that has seen the anime or read the manga, but if you still wish to watch it, do not expect much out of it.

melahuac,Only thing redeemable about the movie: it helps draw attention (of people not into anime) to the original series,01/10,27-Aug-17,"There is not much I can say about this movie that hasn't been said already in other reviews. The acting is bad and cheesy (not terrible, though), the plot is weak and shallow (some people that didn't see the original anime compared it to final destination, which says a lot), the script is bad, sometimes laughable. One positive thing about this movie, though, is that it is a way to promote seeing the original anime. Previously to hearing about the Netflix movie, I hadn't watch it, so I give it a try to be prepared for the movie, which was so hyped. I loved the anime and hated the movie. I don't think I qualify as a fan of the original series, since I just finish watching it. So, while my appreciation of the movie is based in part in a comparison, I think the hate of it is justified. It is not only that the movie is not true to the original, but that story-wise it pales in comparison. Trying to judge it in itself, it is just a regular-bad-horror-Hollywood movie. The movie is so full of clichés that if you know nothing about the anime it would just be one of the many forgettable bad horror movies that come out every year. Normally,I would rate it 4/10. But since it was so hyped based on the reputation of the anime, it is only fair to review it in comparison to it (it bears the same name because it is supposed to be an adaptation, is it not?)."

krazydevilchic,One of the worst Netflix Original titles ever,01/10,26-Aug-17,"It's as though the creators of this read a synopsis of the anime, hated it, and decided to mangle it as much as they could.Aside from ignoring that Death Note takes place in Japan, with Japanese characters, the characters of Light, Misa (Mia here), Watari, and L have all been completely disregarded. They even manage to damage Ryuk, though his character was closest to the source material. They strategically avoided anything that made the original characters memorable... They gave Light a moral compass and interest in the world around him, they made Mia a legitimate romantic interest for him. Mia ends up being the ruthless and intelligent partner - a complete 180, while Light completely loses the unhinged glee with which he becomes Kira. I don't even understand how Watari was manipulated when they never got his full name, a major plot hole. The actor who played L managed a good job imitating the physical personality and verbal inflection that made him unique, but fell short when L loses control of himself.Only the most basic elements of the first 10 or so episodes of the anime were used for the plot of this movie. Light Turner finds the Death Note, is acquainted with it and Ryuk, and fairly quickly learns to use it to take out criminals. He is helped along by Mia, and through a series of complicated and mostly pointless endeavors they end up at the top of a Ferris wheel, initiating the end of the movie (at last).At the end of it all, it's a nothing movie: it's missing all the things that made Death Note so compelling to begin with: we see none of Light's involvement with L and the task force, we see nothing of the complicated plotting and planning, we even see Light conflicted at the demise of innocent people (such as the FBI detectives) when he should have reveled in the murder of anyone standing in his way, and showing affection for Mia when in the anime he only uses her. The movie fails to deliver on Light's motivations to become a god and to cleanse the world of anything he thinks is unfit and somehow manages to make Mia's character worse and more bland than the original Misa, a true feat considering how annoying Misa was. Nat Wolff fails to bring the character of Light to life completely, making him bland and uninteresting and sane, instead of the ruthless psychopath he should have been. Even the fact that they based it in Seattle with American characters is insulting, and they make almost no reference to its Japanese origins.The only part of this movie that was remotely interesting or redeeming was the brief cameo of Chris Britton as a newscaster - Chris Britton voiced Soichiro Yagami (Light's father) in the English dub of the anime."
y-72203,"A decent movie with good messages, though less appealing than the manga",07/10,22-Jan-20,"Throughout Adam Wingard's adaptation of the popular manga series Death Note, the source material's powerful influence and origin shine in tandem with Wingard's neo-noir aesthetic. Though it has it's lackluster qualities, the film still provokes a similar sense of horror and distrust of power that spurred on appreciation for the acclaimed anime, even if it's not to the same extent.Death Note, like it's source material, follows the efforts of Light after he comes into possession of the Death Note, a notebook which kills whatever person's name is inscribed in the margins. These books are owned by shinigami, Japanese gods of death. The owner of Light's is a scary looking creature named Ryuk, who has an infatuation with apples. His actions are secretive due to his father's occupation as head of the Seattle police, though he shares his moves with girlfriend Mia. He soon takes up the name Kira and claims responsibility for these deaths, claiming they make the world a better place. Eventually, he garners the attention of an investigator named L. Unlike many Shonen Jump series such as Naruto or One Punch Man, Death Note relies on a simmering plot and strategic moves instead of frequent fighting. Potent plot points come from chess like maneuvers by Light and his enigmatic pursuer.Wingard stated that he wanted this adaptation to appeal more to the audience of the United States, thus the changes in character names and descriptions. Wingard's version of the series takes the events originally occurring in Japan and transposes them on the misty environment that is Seattle. This move was not necessarily well received by activists, as the changes from Asian to American drew claims of whitewashing, similar to other contemporary works such as Doctor Strange and Ghost In The Shell, another adoption of eastern comics by western cinema companies.While genuinely funny at times, Death Note does suffer from ill-advised attempts at the very same humor that enthralled in the anime. Ryuk, who in the animated series was fairly light and comedic, is far darker in the film and his stabs at humor feel far more unnecessary and pale in comparison to the source material. This brings us to another point. While some changes are nice, many feel rushed or poorly thought out when compared to the masterpiece that is the manga. Throughout the movie, Light grapples with the Justness, not Justice, of killing in this manner. Where in the film Light is more concerned about if it's okay to do, anime Light would've been more worried about achieving the justice he feels the world needs. Justness is something that's been tackled in cinema before, justice on this scale is something that made the Japanese variant more compelling.With that all being said, the positives of this movie still outweigh the negatives. The soundtrack and score of this movie are brilliant. A different sort of brilliance than something like John Williams' Star Wars scores, however still something noteworthy. It utilizes ironic song choice in some circumstances to draw attention to the severity of a certain scene. The movie in general uses irony to show how intertwined the actions of ""good"" and ""bad"" people are. During a car chase, L crashes through a ""Drive Safe, Drive Slow"" sign. Though he is intending to apprehend the person causing trouble, he is in fact the one promoting a disregard for what is good. In addition to that masterful use of irony, there are genuinely moving moments emphasized by a beautiful orchestral set.The choice to use Seattle was a good one, if it was indeed necessary to film in the USA. The misty and neon washed city has a certain Tokyo vibe, likely paying homage to the original setting. It is also reminiscent of Blade Runner 2049 in its cinematography and lighting. Dark shots are prevalent and the use of shadow to hide Ryuk's face for the entirety of the movie is an interesting use of lighting. The dreariness of normal and bad circumstances are underlined by muted tones and rain washed lighting, whereas highs are boosted by halogen based signs. The use of noir-esque elements in such a manner deserves praise in a way similar to Frank Darabont, director of The Shawshank Redemption. Another great use of cinematic elements is that of the wipe, which transitioned us back and forth between characters in a particularly pleasing sequence using a bus.The story is, even though it may not be what was desired by fans, still very compelling. The aforementioned chess moves lead to a great ending which leaves the audience hoping for more. Changes to the plot and character qualities make a different yet interesting and slightly more relatable set of circumstances. The substitution of Mia for Misa (the original female companion of Light) is actually a change that I prefer, though it does change the purpose of the story completely.In summary, though there are pitfalls, Wingard crafts an interesting and thought provoking dynamic that still portrays the scary thoughts humans have. Within are underlying messages that many in this day and age can relate to, with potent revelations and ideas. Though it's no masterpiece, it's worth seeing before you die. Which will happen whenever Ryuk decides to write your name down."
jameskidac,I don't know what happened in the director's head,03/10,05-Apr-19,"Well maybe I do, he was thinking of making a tribute to final destination, american pie and cabin in the woods when his table got served with a script from some Japanese anime that he couldn't bear to even watch because it made his brain have a booboo. Then came the casting director who thought that everyone except L in the movie had to be ugly because death is never pretty. That was fine, because L is a fine specimen, but then he was given the personality of an emotional pouty child despite apparently being the smartest person in that world. Can't blame him for it but the entire movie was like a Scary Movie made to be melodramatic because the writers felt they had more class than Charlie Sheen, surely they could make a masterpiece out of this. And don't quote me on it but they probably paid 38 million for the rights, 1.8 million for William Dafoe, and had like paper clips and instacams left for the shoot, that's why it looked like there was no production, no talent, no writing, no backstory, no charisma, you can't blame the director who had only 200k left and some scotch tape to put together the show, he even had to pay like $3 out of pocket to enter the amusement park to finish his work. It is probably the greatest way 40 million has been spent in history."
theapcbuddies,"Avoid it at all cost , it will ruin the original for you !",01/10,26-Aug-17,"A terrible remake of an otherwise wonderful anime. the whole movie seemed quite fast paced story-line seemed dramatically rushed to the point where it might feel like watching a recap/trailer of a big movie. The writer failed miserably in character development and depth. He also let go of many interesting story points and mind games and introduced prolonged & unnecessary chase sequences. At no point it draws viewers into the movie letting them pick sides, which was the best part of the anime. You end up being a passive viewer just waiting for this snooze-fest to be over while enjoying/belching at the final destination- ish deaths of people.

bajaharley,One person ruined the movie.,01/10,06-Oct-21,"This could have been a great movie, William Defoe makes it tolerable. The biggest mistake that was made is the boy character L that thinks he is Japanese and attempts to wear a woman's garment at an attempt to be ""cool"" maybe? But he only comes off as ridiculous and just about the ruin of the whole movie. The boy playing the part of L is such a bad actor that it makes most of the parts intolerable to watch.

jasonhart-37722,Disappointed In Netflix,01/10,02-Sep-17,"I'm totally disappointed in Netflix from creating such an awful representation of the original series. It should have been a series, yes, but even so, it would have been a total disaster with this shitty story line. I was excited until I watched the trailer. I lost interest after the 4th scene or so. The original series was a battle of IQ, Cunningness, Trickery and Ingenuity. This is total crap.

jducker-jd,Having never watched the originals...,07/10,26-Aug-17,"I liked it for the most part, but the ending was kinda lazy and too convenient for me. At the start they did well to blur the lines between good and bad but suddenly it lost all shape. The second half was a bit too messy and the pacing was off.I enjoyed it, having no idea what Death Note was but it didn't blow me away. I think L was good, the dad was OK and showed some nice moments, Ryuk itself was a great change of pace but more could have been done to make Ryuk more...something!It was an adaptation, one that felt a bit like a Final Destination film but as I say, some pacing was off and it got abit too complicated to finish it off. They Westernised it a bit too much by tying a bow in it but ultimately, there is a lot worse out there! Again, it was alright, I enjoyed it but maybe I am lucky I haven't seen the originals yet!"
jettaaaha3,Meh,04/10,25-Aug-17,"I am very disappointed with this. OK, I assume you just cant force whole manga/series into 100 minutes but I was expecting something way better.Light supposed to be egocentric highly intelligent and emotionless sociopath. This is just mediocre kid with issues. L supposed to be logic machine on sugar and we got crazy guy who eventually *SPOILER ALERT* becomes Kira himself... In a way.Mia supposed to be really into Light and not just a cunning hoe.I understand, they came with different story, but man! That was not good idea to borrow characters and totally destroy them. Netflix should made series out of this with caring slow pacing and great intelligent story behind it. We got this mediocre terrible movie instead. But Dafoe as Ryuk - 10/10"
karlovuk,Not the PoS a lot of fans are making it to be,06/10,29-Mar-22,"Deathnote is my fav anime of all time, so 10/10. Does this movie come close? No. It feels rushed. Acting is just ok (except for Dafoe, ofc). It doesn't blindly follow the original plot. But is it a PoS like so many claim? Also no. I didn't find it too slow or difficult to watch and stay engaged. Given the ambitious culture shift from Japan to the US i rate it 6/10. It's an OK movie but I wouldn't exactly recommend it.

Instead, they tried to relate to the source material by keeping the names of the characters and the differences were nearly all for the worse and turned this into a SH**show.

heshanh,Epic waste of time,02/10,25-Aug-17,"I can't even begin to explain what an insult this is to the anime. I get that it's a different take, but the essence of what Death Note is, missing in this. Plot is off, L is off, Light is off, even Ryuk is off. The worse part is the lack of creepy, loneliness in Ls voice. Don't waste your time, just re-watch the anime or the Desu Nōto movie

musukogoji,Not a review of the movie,09/10,26-Aug-17,"Just to be clear, I am a huge fan of the Death Note manga/anime. I had thought about watching the original before seeing this movie but I refrained from doing so. That's because I really liked the anime, but I could tell by the trailers that director Adam Wingard was trying to make this film its own thing and I didn't want to end up comparing the two.I've read a lot of this movie's negative reviews on IMDb, and not once did I see someone calmly explaining the flaws of the movie and why that caused them to hate it so much. I saw angry fans who were complaining that it was different from the anime. And I have nothing against that. If the fans want a faithful live action adaptation of a series they've come to know and love, that's perfectly understandable. But in the past 11 years, we had already gotten that twice. There were already two live action Japanese films retelling the story of Death Note very faithfully. Then there was the Japanese mini-series in 2015. Again, a very faithful adaptation. The anime itself was practically a carbon copy of the manga (aside from the ending), so the fans already have plenty of retellings of the same story. So, what's wrong with seeing something different?When I heard about this film adaptation, I knew it would fail in the eyes of Death Note fans. They would either hate it because it's just another rehash of a beloved story, or they would hate it because it would stray to far from the source material. Personally, I was hoping it would be very different. That's because even if it was bad, it would still be unpredictable. If it were accurate, I would be able to predict anything that happened because I'm already very familiar with the story. But with this film, so much had changed that I could never be sure what was going to happen next. The movie did recycle some plotpoints from the anime, but for the most part, the filmmakers came up with their own twists and turns to try and make it exciting not only for newcomers, but longtime fans.As for the supposed ""whitewashing"", well that's just a ridiculous argument. First of all, it's an American film. So doesn't it make sense to have American actors in it so it connects better with American audiences? It's not like in Doctor Strange (2016) where The Ancient One, a character who was Asian even in the film, was played by Tilda Swinton, a white British actress. The characters in this film are American, so they're logically played by American actors. It's like when America remade The Ring or The Grudge or The Departed. Every character in those movies were white, despite them being Japanese in the original and no one ever complained about those films. If the character's were still Japanese, but played by any other race, then I would see the issue. Second of all, that argument is only made when talking about the white actors playing characters who were previously Japanese. Yes, I did hear many people complaining that L in this movie is black, but never did I hear anyone complain about the character named Watari. In this movie, he's a middle-aged Japanese man, but in the anime/manga, he was a white, elderly, Englishman. Third of all, if this film was really guilty of whitewashing, then why would L, the palest character in both the anime and manga, be played by a black actor?As the title says, I'm not here to review the movie. I didn't want to talk about my personal feelings about it in this case. I don't want fans of the Death Note franchise to hate this movie because it's different from the original. And there probably are some reviews I missed that actually talk about the problems in this film, because it's far from flawless. But I know there are still some who will see something different and instantly shun it and that's really just not fair. It's obvious that this film is trying to act on its own, separate from the rest of the Death Note franchise and I believe it should be treated as such. So, if you're a fan who was disappointed about the differences in the story, try looking at the film again and just try to at least see what the filmmakers were going for and just see if there's anything about it you can appreciate."
catimeup,This movie would 5/10 if you haven't seen source material.,01/10,20-Aug-18,"I've loved the anime since I seen it many years ago. the complex characters, the fact it's an actual thriller, and the fact it was a philosophical starting point in asking ""what if criminals were eliminated"". 
If you haven't read the source material or seen the anime, start with this movie and afterwards treat yourself to either the anime or the manga. If you haven't seen or read either and only seen this movie, I would give it a 5 out of 10, and that is being more than generous. I was largely disappointed with this movie not using any of what made the former so successful. Overall though, i'd honestly avoid this movie. I was reluctant to watch the movie to begin with as I know exactly what Hollywood would do to the storyline. Hint...totally ruin it for the sake of money. Understandable if you consider what Hollywood is built on. Given that my motto is anything once, I was compelled to watch it. I was hoping it wouldn't be as bad as it was, but then again I wasn't completely surprised either. Do yourselves a favour and watch the anime or read the manga."
unketknyte,Worthless movie made by hacks,01/10,06-Sep-17,"Hacks like this director and the writers will never be able to make anything other than gross, disgusting, boring and disappointing movies. You can't make a movie adaptation from an anime show with 37 episodes. It's full of worthless actors, especially the mains. This movie made me sick. This movie is a slap in the face for everyone that loved the anime. A message to the makers of this movie, leave quality alone in the future! You took something smart, emotional, scary, funny, thought provoking and wonderful and just made it full of cringe and bullshit! You'd have to be totally disconnected from the original to enjoy any aspect of this. Adam Wingard, you can't do quality as evidenced by anything you touch.

Better make that 3 thumbs up :DWhere to begin (without spoiling)... That song that Watari sings to L (does anyone remember where that came from? ;) )... ""What's L's name?""...

bannydinns,Utterly dreadful adaptation.,01/10,31-Aug-17,"Possibly the worst movie I have seen to date. Even if you have never seen or heard of deathnote before this, film I would be surprised if you found it at all watchable just for its poor acting, hashed together story and cheesy predictable twists.If you have seen Deathnote then you will know from watching this that it is frankly an insult to the original. It pays little attention to the mental battle between Light and L and completely rewrites (and poorly too) the motivations for Light's crusade. I could go on and on, but I'll leave as saying that this is a travesty of cinema and should go in a hall of fame for being amongst the most poorly executed adaptations of all time.

jribeiro739,Good movie,07/10,28-Aug-17,"As someone who had no prior exposure to the original Death Note I watched this movie and found it entertaining. Don't be discouraged to watch this movie just because it didn't follow the original as some users have already mentioned. I feel it deserves a much higher rating then given. This is from someone who uses IMDb ratings as a guide in determining if a movie is watchable. The irony is this was the first movie that I watched without first checking the IMDb rating. I am a fan of Adam Wingard films and if you are too you should definitely watch this movie.

baraa_z88,Garbage hollywood adaptation,01/10,07-Mar-19,"I think if the original Yagami Light saw this movie he would have written his own name in the death note and committed suicide!

slikts,Uwe Boll-level bad,02/10,31-Aug-17,"Adaptation issues aside, this movie is just stupid; there's no gravity to murdering people; the main character places so little worth on human life as if it was a video game, and it turns out that his crush is equally psycho. The morality is barely explored, they just matter-of-factly treat every criminal as deserving a death sentence, including their schoolmate, for the crime of schoolyard bullying. Even very young children could understand that someone still in school could have the potential to reform, but not these characters.The 'accidental' deaths seem unintentionally 'cartoonish', basically being variations of slipping on banana peels and landing on sharp objects.The movie has an interesting borrowed premise, but fails in execution, and as such is just a waste of time and opportunity for a better movie.

vklexer,You can't change a masterpiece into something better,04/10,25-Aug-17,"okey, i get it. Death Note is an Anime and also a Movie. Why redo it into another movie with the same plot? You changed it and you failed. Not gonna go into a lot of details, but it made no sense why you made Yagami Light into such a wimp. Even the Tsugumi Ôba, Takeshi Obatamovies were better than this

cheeks2202,Its not so bad,08/10,09-Oct-18,"Sure the acting is not perfect, the plot has some holes but for christ sakes this movie is fun. I started reading all the bad reviews while on the fence about giving this movie a go. Sure enough people just dont know how to appreciate the things they say make this so bad actually makes it so good. I wont give you any spoilers but please give it a try.

mackenzie-wiebe,Stuffy and Forced,03/10,25-Aug-17,"Feel how sad I am. Feel it. FEEL IT!!! Question the morality of the characters! Do it! DO IT!Gives you no space to think and leaves no room for the intellectual battle so central to the original. This film leaves all the characters unintelligent, rather weepy, and ultimately boring. For goodness sake, the film ends with the song ""Power of Love""

sophsky,Boring American teen film that is nothing like the anime. But L is good.,02/10,05-Sep-17,"Literally the only good thing about this film is the actor who plays L. He obviously researched his part from the anime and play it well. Everyone else, the writers, the directors... Trash. The anime is wonderfully clever with elaborate tricks, and extended cat and mouse which makes you support both sides; this film is just a bog standard American teen movie with a needless ""love"" story.

dmcculloch-498-629474,Decent adaptation,08/10,31-May-21,"Death Note was a solid American 1.5hr adaptation of a Japanese 16+ hr Anime. Yes the Anime is superior but take into account the amine run time of 16 (37 x 25 min episodes) odd hours that has a story timeline that spans 6 years, so for it to be adapted to a 1.5hr American movie they actually did quite well. If you accept they are going to have differences but share the same lore of the story you'll be able to appreciate the movie for what it is. If you haven't seen the anime to use as comparison you'll thoroughly enjoy the movie as it is clever and has a well thought out and executed script.

gatorstang23,Basically a long Twilight Zone episode,05/10,26-Aug-17,"I've never seen the anime, so I can only write a review based on watching the movie. As the title says, it reminds me of a twilight zone episode, but with the Green Goblin as the bad guy who really doesn't do anything but talk. Not 100% sure what happened at the end. I'm guessing L wrote the kid's name on that page. So was the demon about to kill Light? Funny how only he could see the demon, yet anyone can write a name or elaborate death on it's pages"
loganwolverine41,More Teenage Drama than smartness,03/10,26-Aug-17,"I have watched the Death Note anime series. Haven't read the manga. But after seeing the trailers, I was thinking ""Lets just watch this as a movie cause they ain't going to stick to the source in any manner"". So I went in watching this movie ""as a movie"".So the story begins with the setup of Seattle, USA and the school that our main character ""Light"" is going to. Our female lead, Mia is a cheerleader and takes interest in him for no reason mentioned as such. We also see light help other students cheat in their homework/exam. he is doing this for money and doesn't seem to have nay friends. The ""Death Note"" title comes up and all of a sudden there is thunder, winds blowing hard and a Death Note book falls right next to Light. He picks it up looks at the sky and I am sure he should have wondered ""Well someone took the effort to make it fall right beside me otherwise there is no logical explanation"". He looks at the book cover and sees ""Death Note"" written on it. He could have easily dropped the book but thank goodness it rained and he decided to keep it.The next scene we see another student getting bullied and Light tries to save the bullied student. He tries being smart in front of Mia who is also present there but gets his ass kicked. Then we see him get back to consciousness and he is caught cause he has the home works of other students fallen around. Guess this guy didn't do the homework of the bully who hit him. The principal says Light is in big trouble for all the home works. Light points out that he has a swollen eye. But the principal brushes it off saying that he hit a pole which Mia pointed out. Like really? Where was the supposed pole in that scene? He was lying on the ground far away from any pole! But that isn't the concern, he has been cheating for others. Light gets detention.During his detention, the teacher leaves him alone conveniently and he gets time to look into the Death Note. We see a lot of rules written for it and names that were already written in them before he got the book. But you won't need to know the 100 rules written in them. ""Lets not bore the audience"" said the director. ""We will talk about the rules when it is convenient for the plot."" Now at this moment, Light would have been like what nonsense is this book. Lets just throw it, but then Ryuk appears.Here Ryuk makes an entrance and a very messy one at that. Ryuk then tells Light to look out the window where the same bully, Kenny is troubling another girl. Ryuk tells Light to write the name of the bully and see what happens. The bully is decapitated as Light had written. Now Light knows how to use the book and how effective it is. Ryuk leaves immediately and the detention class Light's in is a real mess. ""Guess who will have to explain for that"", Light might have thought. But the school conveniently forgets it cause hey one of our students were decapitated.The next scene is when Light is in his house which is close to railway tracks and is eating dinner with his Dad. They have a fight about what Light has been doing but Dad forgives his son for using crass and insulting words against him considering a student at his school had died. Light goes back to his room, still angry that his Dad hadn't taken any action against the criminal who killed his Mom and in fact took money from the criminal to let him go on bail. Wow really? He didn't love her enough? And if he got that much money why stay at a house close to railway tracks. Pretty sure you can get a better place to live! Light again opens the Death Note and Ryuk opens one of his closets in a scary manner so that Light passes an apple to him. Ryuk then guides Light to kill the criminal that killed his mother. Light goes to his Dad's room to get the file to know the face of the criminal and his name properly to kill him gorily. Then the next scene is when Light is reading the Death Note at a basketball court (no context why there only) where Mia is also there.Mia sees Light reading the Death Note and asks him what he is doing. And Light conveniently tells her about it cause? She is the female lead and Light likes her (how?). I can go on and on how convenience is made from one part of the story to another but if a story relies too much on convenience it goes to show that the story is reactive rather than creating curiosity and proper continuity.Light's character is portrayed as smart, weird and evil-ish. But throughout the movie, he does so many silly things. Mia's character literally needs justification for her to be present otherwise she is not really needed in the story. L's character although portrayed well to some extent, becomes like a whiny teenager just like the other characters. The movie is a teenage drama story more than a smart one that it tries from time to time. Asmart convenient plot has to cover up for the silliness of the movie throughout. The ending itself is silly. Why reveal all your plans to your father Light? For the audience's convenience? Really? To Anime and manga fans, avoid it. To normal movie watchers, all you get is a spectacle and not a smart story in reality."
ycr17,Worst thing ever,01/10,04-Sep-17,"This movie was almost an insult to the anime, Light is an emo, misa misa is called mia or some some nonsense , Light is also the stereotypical white kid who stumbles on something, the death note rules are not respected, Ryuk is nowhere to the personality of what he is supposed to be,is like he looks for light to kill people which makes no sense he doesn't care about anything besides apples, its just a bad adaptation of the real thing , I had to put me through and watch this garbage. If you watched the anime and you liked it you will feel offended by all this."
MarkSarko,JUST DON'T WATCH ... let me help you out,02/10,16-Sep-20,"I don't know if i can make a balance with this review because i barely saw something positive in this movie, it's the worst movie among its category.The story and the screenplay were almost not exist.Directing was like an amateur work.Soundtrack were like a classical concert, it could express anything but DEATH NOTE.Acting .. I don't even know whether they were acting or playing especially this dumb new (L).

sattu-74749,An amazing take to a beloved franchise.,10/10,28-Aug-17,"This movie was incredibly well done. Yes, it is different from the anime but its something new and something interesting. We could always go back to the Japanese live actions if we want something exact. This was a fresh and stylish take to death note. People need to understand that this is a re-imagination of the anime/manga. The direction is amazing and so is the cinematography. The acting is good, with William Dafoe and Lakeith being most impressive. Yes , they have changed the characters but it only makes them look more human. The ending, that was easily the best part for me. Such an amazing and impressive end it was! So many people are hating on this movie without having watched it. So go with an open mind and you will enjoy this. It is flawed at times but it covers up for it. I am a big fan of the original and I hope a sequel comes out to this movie.

heyitsanname,Confusion and disappointment,01/10,31-Jul-21,"I am really affectionate to the original Death Note, and this feels like a Youtube parody from 2009. The characters are completely different from how they were written, especially Light, the genius that had this dark secret, but it turned out into a naive random guy that in a really short time tells Misa, oh sorry, Mia that he found the death note. This makes the essence of the original show vanish. This movie was also confusing with the whole America-Japan thing. If you see it as a movie that has nothing to do with the real deathnote, I guess it is a decent movie that you would watch only once, but as a Death Note anime fan, I'm just disappointed.Better watch the original."
stilonkostrzyn,An entertaining mess,04/10,11-Apr-21,"Yes it is bad and an unworthy adaptation of one of the best animes ever BUT its entertaining in its own way, on its own i would rate it probably 5 or 6, its not super boring at all, i found the alternative plot even little bit interesting, the 4,5 star rating here is really fair enough.

After watching it till the end. I LOVE 'L' character!!! Lol...The movie is taking up to another level of adaption making movie....if they making exactly like the anime & live action Japanese version, it will bored because we already know what happen (for those who already watch anime & Japanese live action)... NETFLIX Movies never let me down!! Lol, the best DEATH NOTE movie I watch!! Love to the Sequel!!!"
abinashsenapati,A movie that confused me,07/10,01-Sep-17,"Although this movie worthy a shot but still couldn't figured it out about the storyline. How and why Light the hero of the movie had already decided the fate of others. How he knew about others perception in future. I think a sequel must be there. Okay i am waiting for it's sequel so that my doubt will be cleared in that.

Junolinzy,"Honestly, it's not a 10, but...",10/10,13-Sep-20,"I had to help pull the ratings up a little, because after watching the movie, it's not a bad movie on its own. I believe most of the bad ratings came from fans who were expecting to see this movie following closely to the original series, understandably, but I think if one leaves some room and open his/her mind to appreciate the film from the director's and team's interpretation, this isn't a bad movie after all. And, if it's just a straight up remake, or rather ""reshoot in English"" of the original, what's the point at all?My honest rating is a 6.5.

heathgiroud,"Damned if you do, damned if you don't",07/10,27-Aug-17,"To break it down easily I'll start with the pros. Cinematography and score were pretty good. I was expecting something difficult to track or as the new generation of directors are guilty of, jump cuts and shaky cam but I feel it kept the flow well. Character design and voice acting, I was a fan of. Having watched the anime I knew going into this movie it was going to be a task to both recreate and expand on a ghoulish monster but I feel like the semi concealment and design of Ryuk was really well done. Willem Dafoes voice acting was on point and really brought the re-imagination of the film through. You can be critical of Lakeith Stanfields portrayal of L but in all honesty, that would have to be one of the most difficult roles to portray in any movie of 2017. The opportunity to come off as cringey and overplayed was for the most part dodged and props for that. The rest of the cast did a decent job with, lets be honest anime or manga fans, very big shoes to fill.Now to the issues and the damned if you do, damned if you don't of the film. The story adaptation, anime fans will complain about if the film isn't a direct replication. Understandable to want to step away from a copy paste however I feel like if you did want to shed the concepts and build ups of the anime you should have stepped far enough away to be your own creation. But if it did follow the anime and manga to a key you would've probably alienated a large portion of the Netflix viewership, this would've been a good point to do some market research and figure out which side would've been better to cater to. Japanese style with the same plot, or American style with a completely different plot that you could've torn away from the high school environment and added another layer of darkness and character depth to.All in all it was an OK film, no you didn't follow the anime to a point but I figured the plot twists partially made up for the mainlining of the character Mia and development of the character Light, however this would've been more appreciated early on. I do hope you make a sequel as you have a lot to work with with the established story and now established characters to build on, maybe even include a Misa character. But please, take it out of the American burbs."

mounirabbas,disrespect honestly,02/10,26-Feb-19,"Uh did the producers, writers, director watch the anime series!!! this movie is a disgrace and disrespect to one of anime greatest series ever. a lot of unanswered questions here. like how did L know that Light will have to know the name and face of it's victims?!!!! in the anime version he doesn't wear a mask. only later when he founds out that Light needs to see your face!! light should be smarter but in this one he isn't except for the end, it was brilliant how he saved himself. and L is even dumber! he should the calculated guy who never misses a thing! but he is way too rational! basically what i'm trying to say is i liked Nat Wolff as Light but hated this movie. btw Ryuk was really enjoying his time here lol especially that scary laugh at the end which confused Light a lot lol and i don't get why L would do that anyways!!!"

Just wow. 8 minutes into the movie, and I already see that they remade main character intelligent ruthless sociopath - into some retarded skirt chasing pussy. In short it just sucked from start to finish, just watch the anime if you want something good.

ZapJ,Good Production Values Can't Save the Destrution of a Beloved Story,01/10,03-Sep-17,"The manga this movie is based on is a fantastic story of an incredible magical power given to a remarkable high school student and the way his soul is corrupted by that power. This film destroys every character in the story by changing their personality; their motivations; their growth; and making every one of them shallow and stupid. This film is painful to watch. The filmmakers spent all their time creating remarkably gory and bloody special effects while putting the 12 issue manga in a pile and defecating on them rather than truly adapting them for the screen. If the filmmakers hated Death Note so much, why did they decide to make this film travesty? Way beyond disappointing.

mikaelhseriksson,An insult to OG Death Note,01/10,01-Sep-17,"This is a worthless adaptation/translation, I don't know. If you've seen the original anime Death Note series you'll hate this.I wish I could rate this lower than 1. I don't understand how this can have a rating of 4, almost 5. Even standalone this is an awful movie. Rushed and flat.

sangitau2007,Mixed feelings,02/10,29-Aug-17,"First of all let me tell you DeathNote was my first anime and I am kind of obsessed with it. I have liked it so much but as my title suggest I have a very mixed feelings about this movie(Death note 2017). This story is a bit different from the original. I did not mind the change of place (Japan-Seattle) and the slight change in the story is also manageable but what I could not tolerate is the choice of actors! L and Light in the anime are my two most favorite characters but here I did not like both the actors! Where is Light's perfection? I mean in the anime he is a perfect student/son/brother that everyone adores or some are jealous of - L on the other hand is calm,confident and ruthless about his case/suspect. Here none of these two characters are like that which I think is the biggest setback of this version.I don't know about others but after watching it my feelings are like : wow it could have been a great one but it is not!

pk1873,Should have been much better..,05/10,25-Aug-17,"I love all the Anime and Manga fans.. they will never be happy with anything that is adapted so they should always be ignored, that doesn't mean they are always wrong, it simply means they will never be objective. I've watched the Amine and live action Japanese versions they were good imo, this isn't by any means great it has many flaws Light is horribly cast, nothing to do with whitewashing it's not set in Japan so that point is irrelevant. It's horribly cast because the 23 yr old guy is a bad actor, when he first encounters Ryuk, who is horribly underused, his reactions made me laugh it's that bad. The Mia and Light storyline is horribly rushed and inexplicably foul mouthed. Not everything is terrible though. I thought L was decent, the gore level is fairly high in comparison to the Japanese live version movies. The story has a few decent changes that could have worked if the acting was better and Willem Dafoe's Ryuk is good but as I already mentioned criminally underused. Not sure about the electronica soundtrack I didn't love it or hate it. The potential was there to make something great but the minute they cast Light it was on a slippery slope.. I really can't stress how bad a performance this guy dials in. I was really disheartened to see on his bio that he's involved in a few what initially looked like half decent upcoming projects. Anyway I didn't out and out hate it because I wanted to like it from the start, I just felt it was an opportunity missed for a great 6 or 8 parter instead of a poorly executed movie. I gave it 5 because the concept and some aspects of the production which were good were let down by others."
emiliemartybye,"Horrible movie, even worse adaptation",02/10,01-Sep-17,"There are two ways you can watch this movie, as an adaptation from the Death Note manga/anime, or as a normal movie. Both ways are horrible.Let's start with the characters. Not a single one of them is likable. The actors are all doing a horrible job, and all characters are really badly written. Light is simply a teenager with anger issues. When he's trying to be all serious, all I can do is laugh at his ""angry teenager"" face. In scenes where he's showing ""big"" emotions(crying, furious), the acting is simply not believable and it feels like the actor is trying way to hard. Misa(or Mia as she is named in the movie)is just a weird, edgy girl that is hard to understand. You don't really get why she's doing the stuff she's doing, or what her motives are. Last, but not least, L. The casting for both L and Light were horrible, but with such a special character as L, I don't even know HOW they managed to cast the most normal looking guy ever. The fact that they whitewashed the movie is quite horrible, but the fact that even L wasn't played by a Japanese actor, when the character talked Japanese, was raised in Japan, and worked in Japan, really surprised me. Now this isn't what makes L a bad character of course, it's the way the actor portrays him. L is supposed to be this really special guy whom no one really gets. In the movie he just seems like a 13 year old boy that just watched Death Note and now is trying to impersonate L in the most cringy way possible. Not a single one of the characters are true to the original ones. Neither Light or L seems intelligent (Light even seems stupid a lot of the time), Light isn't cool and loses his temper way to often. Misa/Mia isn't the cute annoying pop idol. Ryuk might be the only character that is OK.I wish we'd see more of him because Dafoe actually did a decent job in portraying him. The story didn't work at all and was simply messy and confusing and it was way too fast paced. It wasn't true to the original story at all, even though I think that's what they tried to achieve. I actually think the concept of making a Death Note movie could be really successful if they didn't try so hard to keep to the original story. Light and Misa/Mia actually had a real romantic relationship, and not the ""work""-related relationship which they had in the original series, and it just ended up being a factor that tried to make the movie more ""human"".The only reason to why I'm not giving this movie a 2/10 instead of 1/10 is because of some nice visual moments, and I enjoyed the opening scene, but the movie as a whole was simply terrible and should only be watched if you want to laugh at how tragic it is."
joker_for_life,A Disgrace to the Original Death Note,03/10,09-Dec-17,"Let me start by telling you that i am both a fan of the Death Note anime and the director of this movie Adam Wingard, given that i was excited to watch this movie. When i saw the IMDb rating of this movie before watching it i was confused i thought how could 2 things i love end up in this result but it makes sense now. This movie is a disgrace to the original Death Note anime, it lacks the character development of Light and L so u don't really get why they behave the way they do. It lacked one of the most important aspects of the original , the battle of wits , the cat and mouse game between Light and L. You never get to see the brilliance from Light and L , u never develop any interest in Ryuk as he is not explored at all. The books rules are distorted to fit anything. I hadn't watched the Japanese movie version of the anime so i was excited to see my first movie adaptation of the master class deathnote but this left me so disappointed that i might have to watch the other deathnote movie to wash it out. This could have been so good , Adam has a unique when i comes to direction that he has used masterfully on his other movies , to some extent he used that style here too with a great soundtrack but may be the script was just plain fractured or may be his hands were tied coz it never did justice to such an amazing concept. Someone else mentioned that this might have been a fantastic TV series and i agree if Adam and Netflix were to make a TV season out of it , may be they could have made the characters 3 dimensional and had the viewers care about them and could have really explored the book , its rules , Ryuk , Light , L , the relationship with his girlfriend The verdict: 3/10 , not worth watching , will make u angry if u love the original Anime and if u haven't watched the anime then go watch it , it is absolutely brilliant."
Incarna,"Different characters, different story",05/10,05-Feb-18,"This is the story about a guy named Light Turner, who happens to share Light Yagami's name. He is not a cold blooded psycho like Yagami - he is a kid with good intentions from the beginning to the end -, but he has a girlfriend for that. And this girl's name is not Misa, which is cool since she is an entirely different character. Look at it as a spin off, another guy getting the death note, the only thing it has in common with the anime is names, the notebook and Ryuk (who is a bit more creepy). Remember that the manga, the anime, and the japanese live action had different endings? well, this one too. It is not a great movie, but at least you don't know wtf did they write.

strandaslak,Do not listen to all the fanatics,08/10,26-Aug-17,"This is just a short review. If you are sick and tired of all the boring blockbuster movies with no violence and foul language, like me, you should check out this movie. I think this movie was great. It has a lot of cool scenes, good actors and kind of a good twist ( though it is easily foreseen ). But all in all this is really a great watch, do not listen to the ones that are whining because it's not exactly like the anime. You all know hardcore fans will never get pleased when a re-imagining/ remake of a beloved series gets released. Watch it and i think you will be pleased.

Daman-Malone,Nah!,01/10,02-Nov-17,"Watch the Japanese 2006 and the following series of Death Note, MUCH BETTER. I find this to be a constant issue with originality or lack thereof. Japan, India and China are extremely underrated for what they have/are producing. Provided you are comfortable reading subtitles and watching the action taking place then it's just as good if not better than some Hollywood movies.10 years from the Japanese original to US screenplay to be developed, yet it wasn't a scratch on the original. Problem is when people want to write up a screenplay to a foreign movie they feel the absolute need to rape it to fit the western audience as if we can't or shouldn't watch other concepts.This US version was nothing more than a pathetic attempt at chucking out some mediocre movie to put bums on seats, which really wouldn't be a problem it was their original concept.It's time to seriously get back to some ""No risk, no reward"" concept of investing. Studios need to take a chance on independent movie makers when they come up with original ideas, not playing the safe game where intelligent viewers end up seeing through there greed and ignorance of treating us, the audience as sheep."
zackplog,Enjoyable film if viewed independently,07/10,05-Sep-17,"The number one issue I've seen is that people complain its inability to adhere to the manga or anime. If that's the case, then the anime for Death Note should be mocked for not adhering to the 109 chapters of the manga. How could anyone possibly fit such material into 100 minutes (minus x amount for credits). Are there issues? Yes. Is there a film out there without flaws? No. If inability to adhere to the source then the movie Troy should have the same rating as it absolutely rips my favorite book to pieces. I can, however, appreciate Troy as an independent film within its own universe.Friends and family that haven't read the manga or watched the anime have all loved this film because they're free of biases. If watched in such a way, one can appreciate the level of humanity displayed by every character. Every character is acted out in such a way as to make each of them human and you can observe their reasoning (mostly). These are my responses to the general rejections of the film: Light is not a wuss for screaming at meeting Ryuk. I would have soiled myself and been crying to Allah and Gilgamesh to save me. The math sheet handed over was, indeed, confusing, as he left the bottom half blank and it would be incredibly obvious to have different handwriting halfway down the page. That may be on the dumb guy trying to pay for a paper or it could be that Light copied the guy's handwriting well enough. I don't know, but it's a fair enough object to 'note', along with Mia's smoking in order to say, ""Oh look! She doesn't care about the rules! Rawr!"" Ryuk's prosthesis were amazing. Even those that have seen the anime and read the manga have admitted this. The clacks of the spines were creepy, especially when paired with William Defoe's level of creepy. Light and Mia Sutton created Kira as an alter-ego with different views from the start without fully knowing it. Light was limited due to his upbringing, though even this starts to break as the film progresses. Mia is used as the avenue to this end. L and his actor was actually displayed almost with a sense of aspergers and the additional explanation of his background help to solidify why he behaves the way he does and doesn't just throw it out as, ""Oh hey, look at this quirky character!""I went into this movie expecting it to be utter garbage and found myself actually being drawn in. That very rarely happens to me. Yes, there were some poorly done tropes in the beginning but, again, they're trying to put so much content into such limited time (and limited budget). The fact that we're running with human actors allows for far more facial expressions to take place that drawing alone. Truly, though, Ryuk was the number one thing that pulled me in...because holy crap. Stop looking for reasons to try and not like it and just watch the movie.In summation: If you don't go into the movie expecting to see 109 chapters of a manga crunched into near equal minutes, you'll enjoy it. It's why I give it a solid 7...or 6.7. Whatever. Go in expecting it to be different from the source, while still maintaining a definite presence from the source. (Again. If I can get over Troy, everyone else can get over the differences between the manga and this movie. This is a logical fallacy and I don't care...well I do care...but not a lot.)"
anthonymcinnis,Relax,07/10,28-Aug-17,"It's honestly not bad. Of course it's not as good as the anime, nobody expected it to be. In fact I really like that it takes liberties with the source material. If you are a fan of the the original like I am, I advise that you go in treating like a what if or alternate story. There already exists live action movies that follow the source material closely. Give it a chance. The cast is great especially Ryuk and L. It has some creative usage of the death note. While it does move too fast at times, it has a good pace, so at least it isn't boring.

t-09747,A lot of haters make it look worse than it actually is...,05/10,18-Mar-21,"Well, this is definitely not a great movie. But why so many haters with the 1-star reviews? There are a lot of movies which are much worse. At least this one has some idea and storyline. And what do you expect from a fantasy movie? It's OK for entertaining content. Better than the Mandalorian which has 8.8 when it has no storyline whatsoever.

Tuentin_Quarantino,Why?,01/10,31-Aug-17,"If you haven't seen Death Note (2006) it is in my opinion, not only the greatest anime of all time; but it is one of the best shows i've ever seen, period. And I didn't have high hopes for this movie seeing as how most anime-to-film adaptations fall flat on their face. But I decided to give it (somewhat of) a chance. And I watched it...I wish I didn't. This is beyond the worst film of the year, this is one of the worst films i've ever seen. Structurally it is the only movie off the top of my head that can be described as a disaster. That's all it is, a white-washed, made-for-money disaster with no artistic value. The things I like; nothing. The things I don't like; everything. The movie fails on every level, besides a decent voice performance by Willem Dafoe, everyone's acting in this movie is bad, like, really bad. The actor for Light is bad and over the top, I can't really blame his actor, Nat Wolff, they changed Light's character so much I don't think even HE knew what kind of a role he was supposed to be playing. Misa sucks in this movie, oh please excuse me I meant so say ""Mia"". They took away one of the most important parts of Mia's character, she's naive. In the anime she lacked wisdom or much reasonable judgment, and that's what made her interesting to watch, she was the yin to Light's yang, her having the Death Note is like giving a 5-year old girl the powers of a god, and the juxtaposition between her and Light; a clever, conniving killer, was fantastic and incredibly well done. Here she's basically a slutty bitch...Yay? I don't know who said it was a good idea to take a character like Amane Misa, and make her like Veronica from Riverdale (2017), but they need to be fired. I don't care if they're trying to feed their children, they need to be fired! Well at least Veronica has empathy and problems that make you feel bad for her. Now before I get to the absolute worst character in the film, let me talk about Ryuk, and although he may not have been my favourite character from the show, he was certainly the most entertaining. Ryuk is the best character in this film, but that's not saying a whole lot, seeing as how he has no freaking screen time and we never get to see him. It honestly boggles me that they take a beloved character like Ryuk and throughout the whole film, he has a screen time of, i'm gonna be generous and say 7 minutes. And we only get about 2 decent looks at him, but overall they didn't mess his character up too bad. But still, 7 minutes? And now the worst character probably ever: L. I. Hate. L in the movie. I absolutely loathe this interpretation, he's terrible, he's so freaking terrible, he ruins every scene he's in. Apparently there was a controversy surrounding his actor, Lakeith Stanfield, when he was first cast as L. Everybody calling the fans of the Original L racist, like ""Oh, you don't like him cause he's black"". So unless you're 5 years old or a bigot and don't like him cause he's black, screw you. I don't hate Keith cause he's black, i hate him cause he sucks as L. I've seen him act before in one of the best films of the year so far Get Out. Even though it was a minor role, I think he did as awesome a job as anyone else in that movie. He was good...Not here. To be quite honest, I do have a problem with the casting, but like I said it's not because he's black...It's because he's too, damn, old. Lakeith Stanfield is 26 years old, that may seem like a kid to a 90-year old. But to me, he's an adult. And an adult should not play L, and if you're gonna get an adult, at least get someone who looks young. Cause do you know how odd (and kind of creepy) it is to watch this film, and have characters say lines like ""You're younger then I thought you'd be"". It's like making a Steven Universe Film and casting Jack Nicholson as Steven. But everyone treats him like he's 12. It's creepy. And not only does Keith not fit L's character at all, his acting is just terrible. I'm sorry, I don't know if you tried...Or cared, but your acting sucks. OK, the acting and the casting is weak. Simple enough, anything else? Yes. I don't know how to explain this but, the movie feels really short. This movie is 100 minutes and it feels like 30. The people reading this will know what i'm talking about. The pacing is just sonic speed. And not in a good way. They spend no time developing character and that makes every scene feel pointless and when every scene is pointless i'm gonna forget about them and when I forget about them that means I'm not experiencing all your movie has to offer hence, you've made a bad movie. Plus every scene for me felt like it ranged from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. I was honestly shocked with how little character scenes there were, and by the end of it I was like ""was that a trailer or something?"". The pacing and directing is bad, is there anything else? Not really, but if i'm giving a fair review there was one thing I liked. The score was good, it reminded me of the music from the show and that was cool. But besides that, this movie was a total disaster and most people hated it. Including myself. This was my review and I hope you hated it."
awroblewska-16252,Netflix what have you done,01/10,02-Sep-17,"Netflix you were supposed direct a movie about death Note not wipe your ass with it and then pretend it's a movie you all deserve your place in the death Note (the original) This movie is so terrible I still have nightmares about watching it. I think even bio dome was better then this and it's one of the worst movies of all time congratulations you were able to beat it. One piece of advice for the future if you are making a movie based on something don't just take a title and crap on it and try to sell it as a movie

cyanidefor-fun,Very VERY unsettling,01/10,25-Aug-17,"As a fan and viewer of the original death note anime, this movie was so unsatisfying and disappointing to a such degree that if it existed I would make my self drink a gallion of bleach. For me it was sad to see such a calm, cool and relaxed character with nerves of steel such as L to have his whole character changed into a maniacal revenge thirsty kid on a rampage half of the movie. However for people unfamiliar with the original anime, this movie is decent and probably a worth watching if you're into these kinda movies."
notaweeb-19542,This movie is so bad that its good,10/10,22-Jul-22,"Out of all honesty, this movie sucks, but when you watch it as a comedy then you can actually enjoy the movie. Other then that the only good thing about the movie is Willem Dafoe as Ryuk, that's it.3/10, this movie has too much dumb stuff to make you engaged
but all that dumb stuff makes up for being stupid and funny in some ways, so 9/10 as a comedy, love this movie, don't care what anyone says.

giilbeertoo,Dragon ball evolution 2017,01/10,26-Aug-17,"i think they just had to stop doing that,never worked and never will, i know that the target public for this is people who doesn't know the anime or the mangas, but this is no the way of getting people to know about them, is like dragon ball evolution, to much ''americanize'' the movies just don't work with this.

alesjonestrader,"Don't believe the haters, excellent soundtrack",08/10,08-Sep-17,"I read loads of negative reviews about this film, but 99% of them are from obsessive ""fans"" of the original comic. People like me who have NOT read the comic - because we actually have a life - LIKED the movie.Yes OK so the movie was not ""great"", but was watchable. The soundtrack to this film was absolutely awesome. In fact, the score was the main saving grace of the film and why I stayed and watched the movie all the way to the end. I am a great fan of 80s synth sound, and it was used in this film brilliantly.So don't believe all the haters. The movie was OK and the cast was well chosen. I think the film could have been better if it was shorter, but again, the music made it worthwhile.

helliox,The only thing good about the movie is it's name,01/10,01-Sep-17,"I rarely write a review but this movie has compelled me to tell you to not waste your time. Why did they want to make a movie and ruin the incredible story line from the original? The characters seem very immature compared to the original animation. It usually happens the other way around. The battle of wits that I nail bitingly watched in the animation was reduced to inexperienced actors with weak lines trying to just get it over with. Save yourself the headache and go watch the original again.

jameswgarrity,I haven't seen the original so....,09/10,18-Sep-19,"Unlike all the anime (or whatever) fans who are disappointed this wasn't an exact duplicate of some other show, I thought it was an alright watch.I couldn't help but notice most of the low-rating reviews were one-offs posted by people who haven't reviewed a darn thing else (and probably are uncomfortable talking to the opposite sex) who are pissy about the above ""not the same"" issue.Yawn. Gave it a 9 out of 10 just to annoy the pimply fan-boys. It's an average flick and worth a watch if you have time to kill.If you've seen the original you should probably go watch some more Asian cartoons instead of this...or that all-women version of Ghostbusters, you'll love that.And no I don't know what a 'manga' is.... and don't care."
rammuscentral,"Could have been worse, doesn't mean it's good.",04/10,25-Aug-17,"The new death note movie strayed pretty far from the source material but was none the less tolerable. The performances of Lakeith Stanfield as L and Jason Liles as Ryuk in particular were very good. Aside from that, the movie was mediocre and at times just felt it was trying to be edgy for the sake of being edgy. That, and there was a pointless Inception-esque ending that added nothing to the movie and felt contrived.Alongside that, it they said how Light was smart quite a few times but I never felt I actually saw it until the very end of the movie. In fact he was consistently making mistakes, and the one semi- intelligent thing he did was immediately found out by L.Finally, the character of Mia. She seemed like an addition to the plot that was not only unnecessary, but actively took away from the movie. Because she was the one who killed many of those deemed innocent for the sake of furthering their goals against Light's wishes. Her being their took away the battle between Light and L as Light was no longer debatable immoral, and made Light seem like just a kid caught up in the events of the movie rather than the character that drives the plot.Watch the source material, it's way better."
brokenwillow,Willem Defoe at his finest.,10/10,20-Apr-19,"This movie succeeds on multiple levels; the characters, Willem Dafoe, the plot, Willem Dafoe, and the movie has Willem Dafoe as a CGI Willem Dafoe. I love this movie and everything about it, and with Willem Dafoe as the titular main protagonist, this movie truly works and it's definitely my new favorite film. Good work Adam Windfielkd,

raiderfan_08,Why all the hate again?,08/10,11-Nov-18,"I don't get the low average rating. The acting for the most part was believable and good. The introduction to the ""Death Note"" was well enough explained and overall plot was enough to keep interesting. Even though it's loosely adapted from the manga which I love, I'm going to stay hoping for a part two.

pitfiend-25509,Not on par with the source material but still entertaining,07/10,26-Aug-17,"'Death Note' is by no means a bad movie, it simply takes the story in a different direction than the Anime series it's based upon. Although this interpretation isn't as gripping or engaging as the original battle of wits between the questionably moral protagonist and his unwavering antagonist it is still an entertaining experience which is trying to treat at least some aspects of the source material with respect. The acting was surprisingly good; Willem Defoe was spot on as Ryuk and Lakeith Stanfield definitely rose to the occasion and really shined playing his character 'L' in a very loyal way despite looking very different compared to his pale and shaggy haired Anime parallel, being an Afro-American. Unfortunately even the powerful acting across the board couldn't compensate for the wrong portrayal of the main character as a confused youth instead of the self-righteous and determined mastermind he was meant to be which was inexcusable and ended up missing the whole point of it's original inspiration.

banzaiortiz,Entertaining Japan-Americanized Fantasy-Horror Movie,07/10,05-Oct-17,"I never heard of/saw/read the original Anime/Manga so i watched this movie without any prejudgment.And i have to say i thought it was a highly entertaining supernatural/fantasy-horror movie with a nice build to the finish.I was not convinced by all acting performances, and thought partially the cast could have been better as well as the enactment. But overall it was still exciting to watch.I loved the character of Ryuk, and Willem Dafoe as Ryuk is just absolutely perfect. ""Humans are so interesting"" - great ending line for Ryuk! It might probably be true that the movie does not match the greatness of the original, but on it's own for people like me - without knowing about the Japanese original - who just wanna be entertained by a fun fantasy-horror movie, this is a good one."
jrogerson,Should a film be rated down for being worse than the source material?,05/10,26-Aug-17,"The answer is of course no. It should be rated on its own merits, which is why I'm bothering to write this review at all, in an attempt to balance out the laughable one star reviews it's got. This isn't a great film, I'd give it a five, which at the time of writing isn't far off its overall IMDb score, but it's far from a one. No, it's not as good as the source material, but it's competent and vaguely interesting. Its main problem is that Death Note doesn't really work as a film, and certainly not one this short. Too many plot points are glossed over or omitted and the characters aren't given time to develop. If you have nothing else to watch there are worse ways to kill a couple of hours, but if you've not seen anything Death Note before start with the anime.

styc1,Does the anime/manga no justice!,05/10,26-Aug-17,"When I go into a movie that's a remake/reboot to something, I expect change in some places sure especially if the source comes from another country, but there's certain way that make sense and certain that don't. In my opinion the core main personality traits of a character should stay intact and then you change the events they get themselves involved in to show us a different perspective or way the story could have gone. In this remake though they completely destroyed the core tenants of the five main characters, Light, L, Misa (Mia in this version) Ryuuk, and Light's father.Light in this version is a good two shoes wuss. He gets bullied giving him the slight motivation to try the death note when he finds it but a lot of Light's early decisions are made by him, rather he is easily peer pressured into using the book by Ryuuk and Mia. Light in the original would never have given into peer pressure and he himself made the decision to try it before ever even meeting Ryuuk. Light for as evil as he may have become never wavered in his actions unlike this Light who just seems along for the ride at some points.Speaking of Ryuuk he might be the most butchered character and yet having said that, he is probably the best part of this movie. I liked the special effects they used for him and some of his lines but he basically is the antagonist of this movie. Where in the original Ryuuk was mainly a neutral party who just enjoyed the show and never helped anyone, here he is desperate for people to use the book. Misa or Mia as I said she is called in this movie is way more intelligent and hardened then in the original. She is actually painted out to be the more evil of the duo even trying to one up light and steal the book from him at one point.L is quite the travesty in this version. No longer is he the calm, collected and intelligent detective that he was, Now he gives in easily to his emotions and was even willing to kill Light at one point and it's hinted that he just might have stayed the end of the movie. This is such a slap in the face to people who liked the character of L.Finally Lights dad can almost be considered a worthy enough American version of the character if it wasn't for at the very end when he finds out that his own son is Kira, it's hinted that he might view Light as the lesser of two evils and let him run free and continue doing his thing.All in all, this movie gets a 5 out of 10 for some moments it had and the special effects when it came to the gore and Ryuuk were nice but the butchering of these characters just cannot be forgiven!"
ashwin-avasarala,Completely loses the point of the actual story,01/10,29-Aug-17,"Any storytelling is built on the characters. This movie did absolutely nothing to build the characters. The main tension in the movie is because 1. Light is a genius megalomaniac who hates attention and always plans 50 steps ahead. 2. L is a genius who can see and plan 50 steps ahead. The cat and mouse between the two has legs because Light and L both anticipate and plan every move that the other person would/could make. 3. Both characters are so stoic and intelligent that they know not to cloud their judgment with emotions. This movie did not even think of this. In this mess of a movie, Light is a just a teenager who doesn't even plan ahead enough to hide the Deathnote well enough just in case his home is searched. His dad is the freakin Chief of Police! Likewise, L would very very rarely lose his temper, because a) he has thought through all outcomes and issues, b) is he loses his temper, he knows that emotions would cloud his judgment. This is an insult to the intelligence of viewers and a clear cheap trick to make money."
anitsuj,Absolutely horrendous,01/10,03-Jan-19,"There really isn't much to say other than the writers and producers for this movie dumbed the anime story story way down. This story is for somebody in grade school; and it is way too dumbed down for anybody over 15 to want to watch it... and yet it is rated TV-MA. The anime was fantastic; this movie is terrible. I do not recommend ANYBODY to watch this.

And at last DEATH of DEATH NOTE.There is lot to say but i don't want to make review lengthy.I will say one thing to all NEW VIEWER of death note to not watch this movie before the SHOW. Firstly watch the show than go for the movie. 2006 movie is much better than this.

knicksjz,Wasn't anywhere near as bad as ratings suggest...,06/10,14-Oct-17,"I watch a lot of Netflix, so I've seen trailers of Death Note long before its release, and I've been waiting to watch it for some time now. Right before finally watching it, I saw the 4.6 star rating it got from critics. But after finally watching it, well, it's not a terrific film but its damn sure not terrible either (and definitely not worthy of the lowly 4.6 star rating). True, the Death Note manga story wasn't meant to be turned into a movie, it just works better in a comic book due to the many unrealistic occurrences regarding and within the story. But it is definitely watchable, that is for sure and I sincerely felt it deserved 6 stars at least.

danieltcvo,Plot holes everywhere *SPOILER*,02/10,27-Aug-17,"There was a scene where Light got upset in school because Ryuk killed 12 FBI agents, he and Mia were fighting about this loud and clear in the middle of the day in a school full of people walking around. When are killing people here and there, then I suppose they need to be more discrete than this.L are sure about Light is Kira, and in that scene where Light wrote Wataris name in the Death Note, Watari called Light a couple of times and I don't even know why L didn't even listen to Lights phone nor Wataris phone.There are so many plot holes to count and after this one, I've had enough of this movie.

thegreatdeserter,Good,07/10,25-Aug-17,"What I can see from this movie at the first time was a huge mess. But I know the type of Netflix. It had its own specialty. I do understand that Light had different contexts with Japanese and Seattle for sure, but yet, we were confused by these things. I saw some kind of feminist way of a wishful want-to-be death note owner, that was Mia. Masculines were presented by these two guys, Light and L. They showed their mess but Mia didn't show more but less action. In the end, this movie should continue in the series. I support you Netflix.

lololuvemma-665-728598,Reminds me of The Butterfly Effect,07/10,01-Oct-17,"The story is based on an interesting (if not original due to being an adaptation of an anime) high-concept. This is meant to appeal primarily to teens and young adults due to the main themes: lonely teen gets revenge upon his tormentors, gets the girl, is revered by the World and even gains the respect of his father.It's beautifully shot, the actors are OK and the plot is always understandable. It's a solid 7 in my book. Overall low score is influenced by all the anime fans not pleased with it."
swagathor,Dumb Note,02/10,07-Oct-17,"This seems like it was written by people who did not like or understand the source material. Mediocre acting and cliché dialogue aside, the main problem is that the movie doesn't focus on the strengths of the original story. The game of wits between Light and ""L"", which was the centrepiece of the originals, has been sidelined to make room for your average teenager love story. It just isn't nearly as intelligent or suspenseful as the anime series. We're also not given enough exposition to make us understand the premise or care about the characters. In the manga/anime the story starts with the death god Ryuk, being bored with his existence in the realm of the death gods, he decides to ""spice things up"" by dropping his ""death note"" on earth to be found by a human. To Ryuk, subsequent events are just for his personal entertainment - like a social experiment. This sets the whole premise for the story, and it is never even explained in this adaption. We never learn why Light (the main character) finds a death note, and Ryuk's motivations are unknown to us at best and contradictory at worst.

bhaberle,Great Manga and Anime Ruined,01/10,27-Aug-17,"Sad to say this is nothing at all like the Manga and Anime. Everything has completely been changed for the worse. The main character is a moron and nothing like how he is supposed to be in the series.L's character had a few flashes of brilliance but for the most part didn't live up to himself as well. I have no idea why they had to take a perfect story and completely change it. This is not Deathnote. They used some of the same character names and the book concept but nothing else is the same. Usually Netflix does a great job but this was worst I have ever seen.

xander89,Don't bother,02/10,08-Aug-18,"Let me start off by saying I love the original Death Note anime. However this live action rendition is absolutely horrible. I appreciate what they were trying to do but really NetFlix.. The main character is a bad actor with no talent whatsoever. I had to force myself to finish it. It just drags on and on with a confusing plot and bad acting in general. Do yourself a favor and skip this monstrosity of a film.

gagamuric,Worst try at live action movie adaptations since Dragon Ball Evolution,01/10,25-Aug-17,"When you have a great story, enough CGI to make it happen and a solid cast but you still make genuine crap. It's like studios miss the point with live action movie adaptations. Fans want to see the same stuff from the anime.Because that's what made it a phenomenon in the first place. As close as you can get. There should be no room for creative en-devours for screen writers. No love story, no angsty kid when the protagonist of the original isn't such. I really hoped they would actually get it due to Netflix being more daring than standard studios. But no, they want people to serve the image of what they think the people will like. There is a reason why the original was great and watched. It was hard to get the brutality and God complex of the main protagonist which was his trait from the beginning. It's the same reason shows like GoT are great. They are hard to swallow and hard to resonate with.That's what lacked here, mainly. That's what even viewers that don't know the original won't like.

krnbhogle,Life has so many beautiful things....,01/10,26-Aug-17,"Life has so many beautiful things so appreciate those things of beauty and ignore this bloody stupid movie. This is not even 0.001% close to the original anime. Light and L both had their intentions and were highly motivated. The anime was packed with suspense and intense music. THIS IS A TOTAL RUBBISH.So spend time with your family and love all instead of wasting your precious moments on this one.

lordDEMAXUS,A horrible adaptation and a horrible film,02/10,27-Aug-17,"The movie was worse than I anticipated even though I was actually enjoying it for the most part. A lot of the enjoyment came from unintentional comedy in the movie like Nat Wolff's horrible scream, the stupid character actions and the music choices. It works more as a comedy rather than a thriller kind of like how Alien Covenant works more a slapstick comedy rather than a horror film. That is really the only reason the movie gets a 3. If I take out the unintentionally funny bits, you get a pretty boring and shallow movie about angsty teens making stupid decisions. It becomes even worse when you have read the manga or/and watched the anime. The characters are nothing alike their manga counterparts. Even Ryuk is played of as being more scary than he should be. Even if you take away from the fact that it is an adaptation. The acting is hilariously bad. The characters are inconsistent and a lot of the dialogue is exposition. The directing choices are weird(a dutch angle was used in such a cheesy manner, there was a slide transition, cheap 80s music that does not fit in with the tone) and felt like he was imitating an 80s B movie and that is not what this movie should be. The cinematography is stylistic but in the same way a Bay film is stylistic. The shots are simple and flashy and don't require a lot of work and none of the shots last for more than 5 seconds.I am giving it a 3/10 and would say it is almost as bad as Suicide Squad(for similar reasons even) but the only reason Death Note is better is because I had a fun time(for the wrong reasons)."
madeharta,All mess,01/10,02-Sep-17,"This was the most awful movie I have ever seen so far. I expect a lot based on the original version of the movie. However, the plot's of the movie is all mess. I think the Director is out of mind to change the original plot. On the baseline, if the Director is not capable of remarking other;s movie, it is better to stick with the original version. NB: too many annoying music which are not appropriate with the scene. So don't waste your time to watch this crap movie.

bluebirdie0711,Brilliant Adaptation and Astounding Standalone Movie,10/10,26-Aug-17,"As a fan of the original Anime, and Manga of Death Note, I was familiar with the source material. So, after watching the first American adaptation of Death Note, I was beyond impressed. Adam Wingard, the director, is one of the up and coming greats in his field. With amazing camera shots and angles, a captivating tone and mood, and a chilling vision that transcends the story, Adam has proved that he is a formidable force in the director's chair. Nat Wolf captured the essence of Light effortlessly, and certainly has it in himself to continue the journey, becoming even darker as a character. Margaret Qualley enhanced the character of Mia, vs Misa in the Anime version, by bringing a stronger intention of power and control. Lakeith Stanfield, WAS L. He became everything L ever was and more, dedicating himself to every tick, mannerism, and quirk of L. Willem Dafoe, in voice and movement, created the intense, and frightening, Shinigami Ryuk. With quite excellent CGI and use of green screen, the movie was able to transcend our everyday life, and incorporate the dark world of death god's and their power. The death note itself, along with its repercussions, were exquisitely written and executed. The collabatory script was well- written, and well-adapted, incorporating the original story, as well as changing up aspects of the story, which lead to more or less the same end result. And lastly, the music. If familiar with the anime, the music of this movie, was every theme and feeling you could hope for. And on its own, it is simply genius. Atticus Ross, along with Leopold Ross, strung together an epic, bone-chilling, and heart pounding original score. As always, Atticus never disappoints with his creations. Graphically stunning, opening and credit sequences, begun and wrapped up this dark and amazing film. Whether a fan of the original material, or a new viewer, THIS MOVIE IS A MUST WATCH. From there make your own opinions freely ..."

PepeGranja,"Bad acting, bad movie, bad everything",01/10,31-Aug-17,"This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen this year, light turner screaming like a girl, wtf is that, light don't do that. OK not only the movie is horrendous, the actors are tremendously bad. why L is black. why you not make the prince of bel air with white actors or turn captain America in an Asian guy then? why you do that kind of things? be true to what the characters are. whoever made this film is really an idiot. he or they just want money. How can netflix commission the making of a movie to people without criteria. why ryuk walks behind like a cat, and where are his wings? (he had a huge black wings you know) if he is one of the most important characters in the story, you destroy death note.

caina_barros,"I drew a lady on a piece of paper and tried to sell as it was ""Mona Lisa""!!!",01/10,02-Sep-17,"I have no words to describe how frustrated I was by such deconstruction of the original Death Note characters. The main point of the story is precisely the battle of intelligence between Light and L. As the whole of the original work has always been shown, how the definition of the word ""justice"" is vague and subjective, always being intertwined with morality. None of this happened in the movie. All that could be seen was the film by focusing on ""awesome deaths"" as decapitation and mass suicide. It makes no sense to change so much a work as well written and executed as the anime and manga of Death Note. In comparison, what I saw was basically as if a child who had seen the picture of the Mona Lisa and decided to draw a picture of a woman on a piece of paper and run towards their mother shouting, ""I did the Mona Lisa I did Mom. ""

puniajat,WASTE OF TIME Movie,01/10,26-Aug-17,Don't watch this movie instead of this watch the anime too much in small amount of time not as good as anime character of light is shown as pathetic weak guy that was not true if you have watched anime then u can understand this Lwas also not good in the movie.. totally waste of money and time i just wasted my 100 minutes on this Don't WATCH THIS........
olaviej,"The anime was good because of its themes regarding psychology, philosophy and ethics",03/10,25-Aug-17,"Where do I begin with this review? First of all, the pacing of the beginning is terrible and rushed, and skips many important themes of the manga/anime. It's not just that it's lacking character introduction, the movie skips much of character development as well. As a result, the characters are shallow and their mutual relationships just aren't what they could've been.In the anime the show was about an extreme ideologist and a lawful good character, both geniuses, trying to outsmart each other; in the movie Kira f's up because he's just mediocre at best, and it doesn't really take any work for L to try to catch him, not that we'd see any evidence of him being capable of that anyway. Ryuk can't honestly be called a character. Kia is a terrible replacement for Misa and I don't see what her relationship with Light is supposed to, you know, ""mean"". In the anime, his exploitation of Misa tells something about his character. In the movie, Kia is the more murderous person and also more power hungry so that Light can be shown as a victim. We don't want our viewers to be confronted with ethical and difficult but important questions, right?What positive I can say about the movie is that it gets better towards the end. The pacing gets better and there's an actually impressive and intellect seeming plot twist."
keithpidd,Terrible.,01/10,29-Aug-17,"I saw the trailer for this and thought the premise of it was seasons and was very much looking forward to it coming out. I was not aware of the original, but became aware of it because of this film. I have not yet watched the original. I saw all the 1 star reviews and has shocked. Most seemed to be from people who had seen the original. I came across 2/3 reviews that scored it 8 & 10, which were from people who had not seen the original, so thought I'd give it a go. Please heed ALL the negative comments and DO NOT watch this film. It is terrible!!! The telling of the story is disjointed and one of the characters is so ridiculous it's crazy. Absolutely awful!!

monkeywithatie,M night Shamala strikes again!?,01/10,02-Sep-17,"Seriously, this is more dragon ball z and last air bender crap. You have wonderful source material to work from and then the director acts like it doesn't exist and mangles the entire movie with complete ignorance to what they're trying to mimic at some small level.Does it need to be different since it is set in a different country than the anime? Yes, but this isn't different. This is an entire re- write enabled by a cocaine high. Go watch the anime with subs instead and petition Hollywood to just stop trying to adapt cartoons to live action. This isn't japan, it won't work.

maria_candy,Worthless,01/10,27-Aug-17,"98% of this film was changed from the original story. Obviously the director only knew the gist of the original story, Googled the title and used the first 2 names he saw and made up his own story with his own set of characters and just copied the names. It's complete rubbish. Netflix and the director and his staff have completely failed. I'd rate a ZERO if I could.

hellocrocodile,Disappointing introduction to the franchise,05/10,26-Dec-17,"I had heard from several people that the Death Note anime was worth looking into. I had planned to eventually get around to watching it, but understanding that it was a series, decided to check out this movie form first since it would take up less time if I ended up not being thrilled. I came in with a fresh mind and no preformed opinions about Death Note so to speak.Things began rather OK- the concept of the story, which is of course very fantastic and requires one to withhold any thoughts of ""that could never happen"" (Well, duh) was intriguing for me and I got an immediate sense of how the storyline could be as addictive as I had heard. Unlike your typical horror film, virtually every character in this film who dies a gruesome and graphic death is someone who you WANT to die. This, for me, is refreshing, because while it is still over-the-top violence, I didn't have to feel for the characters whose deaths I watched. Also from the get-go the special effects were pretty fun to watch.Before I criticize the film too much, let me just say that I believe it must be an extremely tedious task to write and direct a film based on a comic and make live actors portray it a way that comes across as natural and coherent. As someone who has never been engrossed in comic books or manga, I have always noticed this strain. Even Spiderman or Batman movies which are some of the best in their genre have moments which seem a little bit awkward when trying to imagine them in ""real life"". (Like the Green Goblin...) However, Death Note has already been made into animation and that is probably where I should have gone first.This particular take on Death Note tries to force a detailed story into a short narrative and has a rushed feel to it. And while actors seemed as though they were putting a lot of effort into their roles, the characters they were playing felt so hollow to me. Some have quirks and idiosyncrasies developed quite extensively (One is obsessed with candy and always jumps into a crouching position like a wannabe ninja) but personalities not so much. Overall the film seems to have been lost in translation from the original. I get the sense that the original is better, and I appreciate the concept. Spending more time on character development and less on action scenes may have helped."
angelsnevercry,Don't watch it!!!,01/10,07-Jun-19,"If you loved the original Anime please don't watch this, you'll waste your time. The casting is unspeakably bad, the characters are inconsistent, Light is described like a poor bad haired idiot, L doesn't exist at all. Sorry but this guy is not L. I don't mention the soundtrack (?? Is there any??). Even the Shinigami is a total failure. Well done Hollywood!!! You succeeded in raping a Japanese masterpiece.

kakoskalapalikis,Title problem,03/10,03-Sep-17,"The title of the movie was the real mistake . if the movie title was ""a stupid kid and his girlfriend with a killing notebook"" then the movie should be better, but if you wanna take a masterpiece like death note to make it a movie first of all you should make it trilogy and you need to be same as the manga or even the series , also you need better cast but the idea to cast Willem Dafoe for ryuk was good."
libby-75255,"Light ""Turner"" Ruined Everything",03/10,28-Oct-19,"This remake was ALMOST good. It was ALMOST an interesting take on the original, but the character changes and character of Light ""Tuner"" ruined everything.The original was centered on an incredibly intelligent high schooler focused on justice who goes mad with power. This movie is about a ""smart"" (although his intelligence is never shown until the last 10 minutes) kid who wants to get laid and also kill bad guys I guess.In this movie Light is supposed to be smart, he's so smart that he's a delinquent who gets paid to do peoples homework. He's so smart that after realizing he has a magic book that can kill people, he immediately tells a cute girl in class about it to impress her, and spends all his time writing names while making out with her.His character is constantly flopping between ""I want to kill bad guys to help people"" to ""I don't want to kill people that's mean!"" his character is not at all consistent and most of his motivations focus on his girlfriend and making her happy.Nearly every other change in this movie was interesting to say the least, such as
-Having L, the head detective, be a more emotional person instead of the emotional stonewall he was in the original (portrayed by a great actor by the way)
-Having Lights girlfriend Mia (Formerly Misa) be a bloodthirsty psychopath
-Having the monster Ryuk (Also portrayed by the amazing William Dafoe) get more involved in the killing just for funThese were all different from the original but still interesting changes that could have worked. But sadly we had to spend most of the movie focusing on a whiny, horny teenager.The scale of the original has been HIGHLY downplayed. They speed through the police investigation, the killings, and the international panic so much that it doesn't feel like a serious case the FBI has to investigate, it feels like a local robbery in a teen drama.Finally the last 10 minutes were the worst part. The movie tries to make up for Light being a terrible character by pulling the ""but he planned it THE WHOLE TIME!"" card. Despite there being no hints or evidence that he planned anything throughout the whole movie. The movie seems to think this is a great twist and makes up for the hour and a half of pain it put the audience through.Don't waste your time with this terrible remake, if you've seen the original it will infuriate you and if you've never watched Death Note it will bore and annoy you beyond belief."
mgbxox,Wingard's Death Note Fails Due to the Misrepresentation of Crucial Character Qualities,02/10,03-Sep-17,"If you haven't read or watched the manga and anime series of the same name, feel free to have at this movie. You may enjoy it if you like the common teenage foils along with dark, explicit gore, and the story of the Death Note itself is what led it to become the phenomenon it is revered as. Although, if you are aware of the series and have followed the plot in its original depictions, this movie unfortunately disappoints. While elements of this movie were flawed from beginning to end from a fan's point of view in general, the aspect that bothers me the most is the misrepresentation of crucial characters. Please note, I have included a reference to the scene where Light first encounters Ryuk, and have also have alluded to the relationship of Light and Misa-Misa, and character identifiers of the anime/manga in the paragraphs following.Within Wingard's Netflix adaptation, the character essence of Light Yagami (now Light Turner) and L were made to be much more aggressive and hysterical in nature when their relationship is originally depicted and admired more correctly as a rivalry between two highly intelligent, effortlessly formidable individuals in the anime and manga. In the scene where Nat Wolff's character first meets Ryuk, he screams and acts erratically, and I literally burst out laughing at the spectacle because I couldn't picture Light acting in that manner. In the originals, Light sees Ryuk for the first time and faces him coolly, accepting his fate if his death is due as a consequence for using the power of the Notebook. But it's not about mimicking the original works, that's not the issue. What you get from that scene is a misrepresentation of character; the cool-headed, calculated, intelligent, and prideful Light Yagami exchanged for an emotionally unsettled Light Turner who does the homework of other students for quick cash as an homage to his vast intellect, screaming and shaking at the sight of Ryuk or any daunting situation throughout the film. Can you honestly imagine Light doing that? Mia was added as a romantic lead, but the real Light is incapable of love and empathy in the grand scheme of things. The one thing they did well here is present Mia as a different character, because Misa-Misa (Misa Amane) was a devotee to Light and would never think to betray him; Misa-Misa would follow him to the grave and slaughter a village if it would please him, but Mia isn't Misa-Misa. Still, Misa-Misa's character was missed as a crucial role as she is the one who amplifies Light's lack of empathy to the viewers/readers; his intentions with her were never honest and he uses her love as an advantage to deceive. Even Ryuk was uncooperative and deceitful in the film, when in actuality, he was in awe of Light and how fascinating and intriguing he was for a mere human being. The best part of this movie was how well Willem Dafoe portrayed Ryuk through his voice, and the animation of the character was also well done.If they wanted to convert it into an American film and follow a different plot, that's their prerogative, but I believe they should have gone a step further and just changed the characters as well, removing Light and introducing him as Timmy Turner and Ryuk to Ryan for all I care. They already stripped the movie of the major Japanese qualities other than for the quick utterance of the meaning behind the title ""Kira"", and even went as far as using a predominantly white-cast, which has sparked white-washing accusations. They replaced Misa-Misa with a new American character named Mia Sutton, and they should have done the same for the rest of the characters because the fact that each character wasn't reflected properly just makes the story unbelievable. Does anyone even know what Ryuk is from watching this film? A ghost? Or is he a Shinigami, a death God widely feared in Japanese culture? While he is originally recognized as the latter, it isn't reflected through the Americanization of the film.This series meant a lot to me and I was very excited to see it, especially after watching the trailer. I expected a new story and plot and welcomed the idea, but the trailer didn't show me that I wouldn't be able to witness the characters represented authentically. Imagine someone were doing a movie about your best friend's life and you were so excited to see it. You know your best friend to be extremely kind and humble, but then the movie comes out and they present your friend as an angry, heroin addict, and that's how the world will see them from now on. While those who know the person for who they truly are scream bloody murder, those who don't know your friend and don't understand begin to say ""I didn't know them, so the movie wasn't that bad. I don't see what everyone's complaining about."" Wouldn't that make you angry? Wouldn't you want to scream ""my friend was nothing like that""? Well, I'm screaming ""they're nothing like that"", and if they are to make sequels to this film, I hope they do us one better and use original characters this time, rather than further tainting the image of the original Japanese characters. Personally as a fan, I think this movie would have been less controversial if they had just presented this as a separate story and hadn't used scenes or characters from the anime and manga, and I'm genuinely disappointed because the original story meant so much to me. If you haven't a clue about the series, you may have better luck with this film, but I hope it at least urges you to want to watch the original manga and anime as well."
qeeqe,"Sparce, attempted cleverness",01/10,28-Aug-17,"If you don't know the source material, it's difficult to follow, with hastily introduced quirks and post hoc half explanations. If you do know the source material, it's hot garbage. Out of the two cognitive titans in the story, one is impulsive and willing to compromise, and the other is a bumbling fool; if that isn't dumb enough for you, there's a chase scene. They brought a chase scene to a chess match. And gore... but you'll cringe more at the plot holes and hand waving. This thing was so disappointing, I made an IMDb account just to say so.

mrzouz,go see the anime.,01/10,26-Jun-18,"So this anime is one of the amazing gems of psychological thrillers. the movie took that chewed it and spit it on the floor and pi**ed on it then introduced us with the result.in short forget this and go see the anime seriously there is no comparison. this seems like a 10 years old adaptation to the original 10 days after seeing it so he forgot it and started to try to add things up and making a story on his own.to make things better I think it was a good idea for the movie to make this a prequel to the anime easily by changing the names since everything about the characters is so different. sadly the movie makers failed at that so I took liberty to add that assumption to make this movie bearable, However the movie failed big time in the story, the direction, the acting the cheap camera tricks, CGI,.... and so on.
at the end of that supposed to be suspense of this movie I was waiting hoping to see some scenes in the credit that would attempt to lift it, yet I was shocked with scenes of the characters laughing while continuing the same song from the last scene oddly enough. which seemed appropriate as they were laughing at us the viewers who wasted their time and money on this crab.
Light is super smart boy loved in the class and didn't kill for fun. he and L dueled through the anime and even collaborated and it was a master piece.
here he is a bullied boy who doesn't seem to be able to handle his anger killing a guy for bullying others as a mere test.
L was a candy lover (wow they got this right) weirdo who is also super smart and a good rival to Kira, he could keep his emotions away in the anime and not being controlled by them. he suspected light but never threatened him or attacked him he played mind games and that was entertaining.
Ryuk was board and he was curious about what Light and L will do, he didn't hate Light like we see here. 
and Kira sure enough couldn't give orders to guys on the phone as he did in the movie.
zero character development, if anything they become worse overtime instead of improving. and Light being scared in school was really lame."
jjavierv,Watch it and decide for yourself,07/10,26-Aug-17,"I know, this movie may not be your ""all time favorite"", and there are differences with the Anime, but, I think it was a very interesting movie. I know it wasn't faithful to the original material, but its differences gave me the opportunity to not know what exactly were things to happen. You should consider this movies as it really is: a different take on the original one.Of course, it has its mistakes about story telling and all that, but it doesn't mean it is bad.At the end, it's your call if you want to hate it or like it, but first: you should watch it.

spelmo,A very disappointing adaptation,02/10,28-Aug-17,"Comparing the movie to the anime, almost everything goes wrong.The characters lack depth and are just plain boring. Light is supposed to be a mastermind, a very clever and popular kid that becomes a little crazy with ambition. Here we get 2 main characters, both lacking the cold cleverness of the original Light and sometimes basic common sense. And of course, they had to give us a tasteless romance.The story line isn't much better. What made Death Note so great in the first place was the mind games, the amazing plots from both L and Light, that were revealed and left us in awe. Here, L knows who Light is almost right away, using only his deductions. And the only plot comes at the end of the movie and it is quite predictable and unrealistic.Finally, the americanization of the whole thing just doesn't work. It's not about the cast or the location of the story, these don't matter much. But the movie just focuses on the usual American things (romance, simplistic visions of good and bad, action) and completely misses the point and qualities of the original.I am usually an easy audience, and I can enjoy mediocre movies, but this one was just too bad. I struggled to stay awake."
nenufairy,Terrible adaptation AND terrible movie.,03/10,06-Sep-17,"Let's say we don't know the source material and we watch this movie completely unaware of what it was inspired by. We'd notice the completely inappropriately matched music tracks, the main character's awkward reactions and actions that made it really hard to believe he is a ""genius"" as he is supposed to be and, along with many other details, the giant, obvious plot holes (like, L's nonsense first ""deduction"" and how much of the future not directly involving the death of the person can be controlled with the Note- final writing was ridiculous). I'm even writing this as someone who has never read nor seen the source material so as to be as objective as possible, but there's just no saving it. I feel bad that original Death Note's creators gave this a positive review; I didn't know they thought so poorly of their work.The 3 is for personal enjoyment, it gave me some laughs."
dansuper9,"Unpopular opinion: it's actually good, if you puts the source material aside.",08/10,27-Aug-17,"after 3 minutes i almost stopped watching it. i'm glad i kept watching.here is the thing: The artistic decision to choose lighter tone for this remake is not the best thing to do, in my opinion; but given that, when you ignore the source material and watch it as something completely distinct, it's actually very good fantasy-teen movie. the cast is very good, and same goes for the cinematography and the soundtrack. this movie in general has high production values, unlike many Netflix movies that felt like B-movies.i guess the problem of everyone here is the script. indeed, the story could be much deeper and smarter. the suspense level of this movie could easily be like ""Silence Of lambs"". the decision to select eventually flat story that skip many dramatic development and twists or simplify them is controversial for sure. but again if you look it as teen-fantasy movie, this script is still smarter than many other movies in the genre that came lately. the storyline has it's flaws, but if you ignore certain plot holes and changes in certain concepts of the death note, and treat it as a new different story, it could be fun ride. my rate:7.5/10"
ttttony-18640,It doesn't even know how bad it is!,01/10,09-Jan-19,"This movie is like someone wearing a scrotum hat and everyone saying 'dude you're wearing a scrotum hat', but they're like 'it's not that bad' cause they don't realise that it will never be a good idea. If you've read this far you understand my pain.Everyone is dumber as a result of watching this movie.Watch the anime, and the anime only!

lamerok,Entertaining.,07/10,04-Nov-17,"I see a lot of 1 star reviews for this and, for me, a 1 star movie would be something that I could not watch for more than a few minutes. I watched this to the end and I enjoyed it so, for me at least, this is definitely not a 1 star movie.This production certainly has some flaws and I would say the production values are generally what you would expect from a decent network TV show and not a major studio movie or HBO show. That did nor really bother me though. I didn't pay to see this in a cinema and I was not expecting blockbuster special effects. The production values were acceptable and did not prevent me from suspending my disbelief.The supporting cast were quite good. I particularly enjoyed Lakeith Stanfiled (who plays L) and Willem Defoe (the voice of Ryuk) was excellent as always. On the other hand, Nat Wolff (who plays the protagonist Light Turner) was a bit wooden but this did not bother me too much as I found the story interesting enough.I gather that the 1 star reviews are mostly from fans of the original anime. I am not a huge anime fan but I had tried to watch the first few episodes of the anime before I watched this and I did not get very far into the anime before I gave up as I did not find it all that interesting. Maybe I will try and give it another shot. In any event, I found this version to be entertaining and well worth watching."
shaunsomarajan,Bad. Baddest. Worst.,05/10,25-Aug-17,"Don't watch it. Just don't. I'm warning you. Stay away from it. You'll regret watching it. I know I did. I stayed up for hours since Friday morning, waiting for this movie to come out. Should've pulled the plug in the first scene. Didn't. Waited for something good, like L to show up. Haha, what a joke that was. This is legit the worst Netflix thing ever.

AshisanAhole,Made me re watch the anime,02/10,17-Feb-20,"The positives? It made me re watch the anime - and made me fall in love all over again with the original.
The negative? Too numerous to list.
Honestly I don't really mind the story as loose as it is, I feel like if all the characters were given totally different names it may have made more sense. As in it's still about a Death Note but just not Light vs L since these characters are not Light or L.
I mean knowing they're trying to turn a multiple episode anime into a one off movie I knew going in they would skip over some things, it's just the things they didn't skip over had far too many changes, from character motivations, relationships, killing Light's mom? Mia is not Misa. Light Turner is just a little to pathetic and afraid to be the god of any new world. This L too emotional. Maybe he should have been E instead. One second they are saying things like ""that's why I don't carry a gun"" to literally chasing Light with a gun. L would never.
Okay - so I'll take back my no positive things. I think Ryuk's casting choice was great. Dafoe makes an excellent god of death I think. AND (don't kill me) I do like the way the ending (not the very end - god no) but the end at the pier played out. Not in the terms of the plot, but rather the lighting and music and Mia's death scene. That was nice. Those are the two things keeping this from a total one star.
Honestly ? I've read better fan fictions than this and I was so bummed. Maybe we'll get a better adaptation in another two or three years, since it seems like that's what they're doing anyway."

onurucler1,Never watch it!,01/10,31-Jan-18,"I was really hoping that finally after all these disappointment over the years finally something decent is coming. As a loyal fan of the original manga/anime series i am EXTREMELY disappointed. The reason i watched this movie because of Willem Dafoe was in it. I have no idea how they talked him into this mess. Everything was sooo different than the original story. It was already beautiful story. Why change it? They incredibly managed to expand my expectation of a bad adaptation and ruin a masterpiece. Most of movie geeks remember the line from fight club ""I felt like destroying something beautiful."" Well, that's how you do it folks. Unfortunately there are no lower vote than 1. If there was i would give it to them...

vassock,Why are people comparing this to the manga/anime?,08/10,26-Aug-17,"Most of the bad reviews seem to be coming from people who say it's not as good or complete as the anime or manga. Of course not. Movies are usually around 2-3 hours long. The anime is well over 10 hours long. Mangas can be written over a period of decades (real time). Of course it will never be as complete as the anime, especially since the anime had almost no filler to begin with. That also means a good producer/director will ensure the script is modified to ensure they have a beginning, middle, and end. Otherwise they'll film the story of episodes 1-6 of the anime and stop.The love interest is not a teen idol because there isn't enough time to develop this aspect. She's just a schoolmate who becomes a girlfriend/accomplice. The mass agent execution is reviewed through a quick flashback instead of a long, steady process (like it was in the anime). That's just how it had to be.Many of the plot twists had to be changed likewise, but they are still quite good on their own and it all comes together quite well at the end, with a slight cliffhanger. Light is as ruthless as ever and there's no happy Hollywood ending here."

I am incredibly disappointed considering I have a much higher standard for Netflix when it comes to original content. Stick to the original works and don't try to put an American action spin on such a well written piece. This should have been a series with more thought and effort put into it. The lack of caring is blatantly seen and the cash in on a beloved franchise feels like it is the roots of this movie adaption.

OldManDusters,The worst thing Netflix has ever produced...,01/10,19-Sep-17,"This awful adaptation of one an extremely well-written anime is quite possibly the worst thing Netflix has ever produced. Atrocious structure with a terribly written plot, this whitewashed garbage seemed to list every good thing about the original Death Note, and REMOVE it from their production. You cannot take the ""anime"" out of an anime and expect it to be decent. The only decent thing about this movie was Willem Dafoe's performance as Ryuk, but even then, the character was barely used in order to save some money on the CGI (the only part of this entire project that was executed well. This production is a prime example of how NOT to make a live-action adaptation, I was extremely disappointed in this bitter attempt at a movie.

How are we even supposed to know that he's some genius when he is being spastic, running all over the place screaming like an idiot?I don't think that any of the casting decisions were the right fit.

kleo-63432,"Let's talk philosophy, character, and pacing.",03/10,25-Aug-17,"While fans of anime have come to expect Hollywood adaptations to suck (and even Japanese live-action adaptations to suck) Netflix's Death note was what many people hoped to be the exception. This movie comes off the heels of Ghost in the Shell, an adaptation that had many things going for it until it was revealed that it's core philosophical message was the complete opposite of the original. Death Note continues this trend. The original series has a philosophical message that can be summed up in two sentences. There is no ""TRUE"" justice, only personal interpretations. History is determined by the motherfucking victor. The movie fails to reflect on this, giving us no apparent philosophical message. The movie instead seems to focus on characters. It does so to a fault. Light Turner is an angsty teen who is angry and wants to punish people after experiencing a personal injustice (his mother's murderer walks away scott free) kind of like Misa from the original. Mia Sutton is a girl who steps in immediately to try and right wrongs. She is also willing to get rid of anyone who stands in her way, whether or not they are innocent. She is kind of like Light from the original. L is....complicated. The first few seconds of him seem great. but then it goes downhill, then up again. The major problem with him is his dialogue. Sometimes it sounds wrong. There are points where he is talking and it sounds like the writers were thinking ""what does a super intelligent person talk like?"" then another one was like ""ooh, ooh, make him use big sciency words."" Then other times he talks casually and it's fine. Maybe they were trying to hard to make him seem weird. They also shove in his love of sweets with the finesse of an angry ape with a hammer. But when the character gets emotional he turns out pretty good. The problem is that they tried too hard to make him weird. Ryuk is Ryuk with one addition... he is impatient. This leads to the major problem for the movie... that it is a movie. The movie just went way to fast it felt like Kira was caught instantly. L showed up and literally slapped a case 99% done on the desk the next scene. There is a saying I have, a philosophical movie can be made into a series but a philosophical series can not be made into a movie. The exceptions to this rule are very few if any. Watchmen is the closest I can give to an exception but only to a specific cut of the film. That cut (The Ultimate Cut) is 3 hours and 35 minutes long."

alexmichalski,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,01/10,28-Feb-19,"Death Note is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of the anime, so this was borderline offensive. None of the characters act like they do in the anime, there's nothing clever or strategic about the story, and all of the acting is awful (with the exception of William DeFoe as Ryuk.)Even if you haven't seen the anime, this movie still sucks. The story is so stupid, none of it makes any sense. It brings in rules then breaks those rules within less than an hour. None of the character's motivations make sense.There's a point in the anime where you begin to wonder who to root for: is Light doing the right thing, or is he the true villain? In this movie, none of that matters, all you know is that you want every character to die because they're all the worst. Don't watch this.

howtobuyalife,Not terrible. Just a huge waste.,03/10,25-Aug-17,"Is not terrible. I just boring and a huge waste of material. But come on. It could be even worst. Not bad camera and effects Not terrible acting. Is just the story if you remove the basic idea, the development is poor, and kill basic characteristics of original characters does not help. I simply hope they never hire the writers never again for this job. Maybe they are good for something else

plc_flame,Two ways to see this movie,07/10,25-Aug-17,"So, I started the movie thinking ""this will really be bad"".They took the main idea of the anime, changed a lot in the story, and there are two ways to see this movie.1 - If you see this movie expecting exactly what anime is OR following the same plot / characters, you would be disappointed and think that this movie is totally trash.2 - If you see this movie expecting that the ""main idea"", but with really plot differences you will think that is really good movie.If you never saw the anime, this will be a good movie, with a good plot twist, tense scenes and good emotions.If you're a fanboy of the anime and expect that the movie will follow the anime, you will think that the movie is bad.You're eyes changes the movie."
rubeloxlolol,Great Film For What It Is,08/10,25-Aug-17,"Although this movie is not a very good adaptation to the original anime(of which I have also watched) this is rather a great movie. Cinematic shots were well executed and the plot flowed quite satisfyingly. I understand that it can be a challenge to please fans by making adaptations these days. The characters were not very close to what you would expectation from the anime, HOWEVER, I still hold up to the principle that fans need to understand that you have to change things up in an adaptation, SPECIALLY if it is live-action or otherwise, you might as well watch the anime. In a word or two 'Well done'.

alekslarsen,Why?,02/10,26-Aug-17,"""Why?"" is the biggest question for this movie. Why keep the plot about a smart schoolboy? Why have a deathgod thats exactly the same as in the Anime? About 15mins inn I already hated this movie. They have kept the universe. The school, the characters names....but thats all. The personality of the main character is so changed its not recognizable. The way he discovered the notebook was suppose to be random. The way he discovered that he could decide how people is gonna die was suppose to be discovered by hes huge intellect. Im 15 min inn and I already so disappointed that I don't want to watch this anymore. But I tried. The deathgod tells Ligth that he chosen to get it. Light is also suppose to be supersmart. And the first thing he does is to tell the girl hes been eyeballing about the deathnote, telling her that he was the one responsible for the death of the school bully. He is also not smart enough to figure out that hes the only one who can see the deathgod and brings her in to a situation where he believed she could see her. Remembering how scared he was himself when he saw the deathgod I would think he would prepare her a little more than ""when you see him, try not to freak out. I freaked out a little"". If that was a little this is some of the poorest writing I have ever seen.Im amazed about writers trying to ""create"" something new and fail with popular anime. This is so poor and lazy I stopped 25 min inn. When a deathgod destroys almost everything in a classroom when you are in detention and its not even mentioned afterwards I think its damn lazy. Normally I would think the school would suspend for something like this at least mention this to the parent. But no. This was not mentioned around the dinner table when he was confronted about this from hes dad.If you liked the original, I recommend not seeing this. If you are new, maybe you find it more enjoyable. But if you like good movies I don't think this is it. It gets a 2 because I liked the idea of Willem Defoe as the deathgod."
robiu013,Probably wasn't thought-out enough,04/10,25-Aug-17,"So since Death Note is one of my favourite anime series, I guess I could try giving my opinion on the new Netflix film adaptation of it. The production of the film was already riddled with controversy since day 1; from the poor track record, that western anime adaptations hold, to the casting of Natt Wolff as Light Yagami and all the way to the name changes into generic American; there simply was no way for any announcement on this film to not stir up internet discussion. Regardless of that, I actually wanted to see the finished product for myself before writing it off as bad. Personally I'm not as strongly opposed to terrible anime adaptations as others, since I don't think, that a potential terribleness could soil the name of the original. Taking the worst as an example; Dragon Ball Evolution still had a smaller audience on IMDb, than DBZ (20,000 less votes, not to mention DBZ also has a Japanese entry here as well and people likely didn't bother rating both entries, not to mention the DBE rating suggests a lot of disappointed DBZ fans as well within it's over 40,000 votes) and IMDb isn't even a major place for anime fans to come and rate anime series (f.e. DBZ has more than three times as many votes on MyAnimeList than on IMDb). Most of the audience for this movie are probably already fans of the original and other people will either just turn the other way or not care too much about the terribleness of this particular adaptation. But off to the review; the first thing I noticed is, that there was a sense of too much and too fast. The original Death Note was a slow burn. If you rush things too much, people won't be able to swallow the premise and I guess it's not controversial to say, that the early 21st century horror film premise of Death Note is a bit silly on its own. In general I felt, that a 100-minute film simply isn't a medium in which you could adapt the source material in a good way, well at least not in the way this film makers went about it. There were a lot of things, that the film could have established better and at times it felt really rushed. Somewhere towards the end even the main character exclaims, that there are ""too many god-damn rules"" to the death note and justified so, in the series' total of 37 episodes, you could gradually present how it all works, here I can imagine being confused about some aspects of the note's use, had I not been already familiar with the source material. As far as characters go; there's Natt Wollf as Light Turner, who doesn't quite pack the charisma of the mad genius from the source material, but instead comes off as more of an edgy self-righteous teen. There is some idea of the writers trying to capture the genius towards the end, but with little actual genius to show leading up to it, it seemed slightly off character for Light Turner. Instead of Misa Misa Amane, we get Mia played by Margaret Qualley, who similarly to her conceptual mother develops a crush on the main protagonist, but is contrary to her, less of a tool, now coming with a twist and less of goth eye candy for the audience. As far as L goes, I was actually pretty satisfied. For the first half of the movie, that is. Lakieth Stanfield does the source material justice, though the hoodie and turtleneck seem a bit too silly. The edgy anime character designs simply don't work in this particular live-action adaptation, especially considering, that the source material with the exception of some ""J-pop""-haircuts and Misa's outfits lacked the otherwise popular trope in other anime. Unfortunately the writing surrounding L is less than stellar. There's too much of an idea, that L has things figured out and too little of him backing his genius up. For example, if I may allow a spoiler; how does him not getting killed on TV prove, that Kira requires a name to kill him? They obviously wanted to do a different spin on what happened in the anime/manga, but clearly didn't think things through enough. There are a handful of pretty obvious variables on why Kira didn't kill L right there other than what L deduced in that instant. In the anime Kira at least made his presence clear by actually killing someone on live TV. Here nothing happens at all and that's supposed to prove something? In the second half L strays from his source and proves to be more emotional than his anime counterpart, which would be fine, if it didn't make me question whether he is actually fit for his job psychologically because of it. He also has a goofy sci-fi gun for some reason, which I found funny. On the plus side, Ryuk is voiced by Willem Dafoe, which is pretty much perfect. If only there were more interactions and chemistry between him and Light in the film. There's also some goofy horror gore in the film, which I probably wouldn't like in my source material, but since I left my expectations low, I found it funny and an improvement in this film. Another thing, that was brilliant in the original was the soundtrack. Here the soundtrack choices are so bad, it's good. Not to spoil too much, but there is a significant death on a ferris wheel in the movie and due to the song played in the background, I couldn't help not laughing throughout the scene. So is Netflix's Death Note worth watching? I thought it was fine for a single watch and there are definitely some strong elements in it, but generally I found the format mismatched and the writing poor and inconsistent."
homeiswherethehoneyis,"death note ""spoilers""",07/10,26-Aug-17,"7 out of 10 because....""spoilers"" A. who was the person before light that wrote the warning message and why didn't we find out? B. ryuk was never this persuasive. C. why use original names and not give Mia they eyes. D.it is widely known that when someone comes into contact with a piece of paper from the death not,the death gods will become visible.yet Mia saw nothing, remember the bus scene where the guy freaks out after seeing Ryuk would of been nice to see that.all in all great death scenes and chilling first appearance of ryuk, id say watch this first then the anime,for watching the movie after the anime it doesn't give the Japanese show what its worth.would of been nice to see this made into a TV show where they could show depth and really grab the viewers. Even changing the plot and not having it about some high school kid."
bananamelon-07833,"Disgusting, sh***y film",01/10,16-Sep-17,"Awful! Awful! Awful! As a person who has watched the original anime, this totally sucks! It shows absolutely no loyalty to the original source material to the point of becoming completely unwatchable. Seriously, how could Wingard turn Light from a top student to an emo delinquent? This totally ruins everything. Be warned, if you have watched the anime then don't watch this. You will be absolutely repulsed by the level of white-washing that Wingard has done. Don't waste your time on this crap!

fahdupsidedown,Departs from the best of the original,02/10,17-Jun-21,Why is Light a loser? Why do Light and Kira take such obviously stupid decisions? They took an exceptional story and made it into a teen angst drama? Why can't L trace Watari's calls to Light's phone and finish this entire fiasco?This is stupid.
Honu-86,The effects were good...but that's about it,02/10,09-Feb-18,"Ok, where to start? There have already been plenty of reviews but I wanted to add my two cents. I knew this movie was going to be bad going in but curiosity and my appreciation for most things Wilem Dafoe lured me in. For anyone who has seen the original series Death Note, this movie is an obvious atrocity and for anyone who has never seen the original source...should, preferably without seeing this movie.Firstly, the film opens up featuring our two main characters: Light, who is quietly doing someone else's homework at an outside table for the evident purpose of earning pay, and Mia, a cheerleader who is clearly not in the cheery mood, a painfully obvious testament to her different and rebellious nature, furthered by her need to smoke a cigarette on school grounds despite the fact that this is the one and only time we see her do so. Enter main title. Talk about a compelling intro.Then it begins to storm and Light sees the Death Note mysteriously fall to the ground. In the original series he stumbles upon it at school, not knowing where it came from, but here he witnesses it actually falling out of the sky, leading viewers into a painfully obvious conclusion that the notebook is paranormal in nature. No mystery there. He encounters some bullies and 'attempts' to stand up to them, appearing more like a meek geek than a smooth operator, choosing to rely on faux grit by inserting some carefully chosen curse words before he's knocked out and sent to detention because the teacher found his cheat sheets in his backpack. Alone in detention, he's confronted by the Death God, Ryuk, who, not so discreetly, makes a huge mess out of the room for no apparent reason and scares Light shitless, rendering him into a wailing high-pitched sissy pants who, in that moment, voided any empathy I had for him for having just gotten beat up. Ryuk has Light test out the Death Note, coming across more as a manipulator than the bystander he was in the series (there, he simply wanted to see what happened and let Light, who already had a deeply ingrained sense of justice and vengeance, do all the work...the first bit of which was done even before Ryuk appeared). Bully from before, meet construction ladder, goodbye head in a glorified display of gore and, frankly unnecessary, bloodshed. I swear, this movie was just an excuse to see how much blood could be sprayed at any given moment.
Light eventually reunites with Mia after conducting further experiments and tells her about the Death Note, starting out with 'I have a Death God'...as if that's any influence on what he's doing besides the fact that he has an actual book that can kill people. A few things at this point that are just not explained, or properly so...Ryuk's obsession with apples, what a Death God even does, who the original owner of the Death Note was (wouldn't it have just been easier to say it was Ryuk's??), or why it should take a week for ownership of the notebook to transfer, among others. Oh...and the reason a caucasian kid from the US has a name like Light is because his deceased mother was a hippie. Ok.Now, I have no complaints whatsoever about the races of the characters cast...as long as they act according to their characters. Enter L, the world famous detective who, for some reason, does not act like a world famous detective. His eccentric personality (obsession with sweets, the way he sits or speaks) is NEVER enlightened upon. The viewer is simply left to assume that he's a weirdo, so he must be super smart. Sorry, not smart enough to keep his mouth shut when holding a Kira suspect at gunpoint knowing full well that Kira has a mass of public support. For those who saw the movie, you know what I mean. I could go on about how his messy work stations were out of character, how this super detective's behavior was rather uncollected and how he lost his cool on a number of occasions, but that would take too long in an already long ass post. Altogether, for a movie spanning two hours, the character development was lacking in all spectrums. The romance between Light and Mia was empty; they only thing they shared was getting turned on by killing people, and Mia's psychotic behaviors were never explained (in the series, her alternate had her own Death Note and God and had been a Kira supporter ever since her attacker was killed). We are forced to acknowledge L as a super detective, having been raised to be the perfect one after strenuous testing at a worn down facility in upstate New York - on that note, how the hell do jelly beans stay perfectly colorful and fresh looking while sitting exposed on the floor of a building that looks like it's rotted over 20+ years?! In closing...don't watch this movie unless you're like me and just morbidly curious. I wasted two hours of my life and more time now just to vent about the experience. If you're into a movie that has visual effects that aren't half bad, moving shots that could impress a film studies college student, and runs an acceptable amount of time before you're running to pee out that gallon of pepsi you just drank, then this is the movie for you. If you want something with depth, true to the original content, even in part, character development, and just something that makes sense, then this is not for you."
deii-968-444555,Death Note in USA,07/10,27-Aug-17,"I don't get why this movie deserves such hate. It was a good movie to watch. I enjoyed it every minute. People who want to watch this should not compare this to the anime or the manga. It's an adaption guys. That means: We take a part of the story and make our own story with it. Fanfiction writers do the same and they do not such hate. I think they nailed it with the story. It would have happened exactly like this if it would take place in the USA.I liked the characters and the ending much. Ryuk looked really cool! Willem Dafoe was a great choice for this to play.

blakewayne,NON-MANGA READER'S OPINION,07/10,16-May-20,"I found this movie to be fairly comical in a person-controlled final destination plot line. The acting was cheesy at times, but that's the point in a manga to film adaptation. It was easy to tell that they had aimed for that sort of outcome and I don't know how this movie compares to the original storyline, but the entertainment value was there from early on and throughout.

darksaga2006,It was an OK movie,06/10,27-Aug-17,"Most people seem to be complaining about the movie not being like the anime in some aspect or other. I wonder why not re-watch the anime if one is expecting the movie to be similar. In any case I was happy to see the cringe worthy exposition of the anime gone in this movie. The script and plot are not perfect but they are decent and fairly well suited for western sensibilities, and most importantly different enough from the anime. Kudos to the producers for not making a fan film.Another aspect of the movie I quite liked was that Light was not portrayed as the morally grey hero who makes controversial decisions, but rather as the psychopath with a thinly veiled fascist moral compass that he is in the anime. Finally I think it is worth pointing out that this is a teenage movie and should be judged as such. The concept wouldn't fit any other genre really without disconnecting the audience from having any sympathy with the atrocities the hero commits. As a viewer I like that I could pin the misguided morality to immaturity. It kept me engaged."
austinthep,"Not the same, but not terrible",07/10,29-Nov-21,"This is a film that does well on its own, but when you compare it to the source material it's not really that loyal. That doesn't mean immediately it's a horrible movie. If you want an adaption more like the source material watch the Japanese live action adaptions that happened before this movie was made.Everything is different, even some characters names, but it's at least entertaining.

I am a true fan of death note ........ it just don't fit well ...... they made bunch of kids show like light want attention from girl and L is just a kid who act on emotions but i have gave 10 stars because i love death note
marius-reonico,Take it as a different power taken by different people... brilliantly done.,10/10,26-Aug-17,"I just saw it--we saw it--me, my brother, and my sister. ... Now, firstly, all of us are absolute fans of the anime, and after viewing this and then seeing its rating on IMDb, I am disheartened to know that so many people have given it such low ratings bringing it to a score of 4.9. ... Adam Wingard's Death Note DOES NOT deserve a bad grade. It is a well-paced, dramatic, thrilling, horrifying, intellectual, and emotionally-loaded adaptation of the original. It deserves praise and not the bashing that so many people are doing right now. True, it is different from the source material, but if the disparity from this one and the one it comes from is the only reason for others to criticize it, then I am sorry to say, but those critics are at fault. Netflix Death Note is brilliantly written, twisting it in its own terms, changing the rules of the game, and giving the game to different characters, altogether creating something new, unexpected, and on its own immensely good. ... I praise the makers of this for their will to adapt something that many fear to do. I also praise them for being able to compress as much as they could into something of their own. This version is placed in America with American characters, and it does it just well. I wish to go into more detail with the choices that the makers have made and how it works, but I sincerely wish to give the makers praise more than anything else. ... For an anime adaptation, this is better than most. To cut it short, good job, guys. Good job, Sir Wingard. Nice one, Nat Wolff. Keith Stanfield, you did great as L. ... All in all, kudos. ... PS. Willem Defoe was frightening. ;) All the LOVE to the team. Beautiful, beautiful masterpiece."
instantaneouswisdom,"A realistic interpretation of ""Death Note""",05/10,26-Aug-17,"I personally believe that is indeed what they were going for. A situation in which a real living teenager finds the ""Death Note"" and the actions from the movie correlate with what real people would do.It's got the core of the story, with a lot of fluff removed to keep it at average movie length. (Possibly spoilers) In this movie there are cases of the megalomania that would transpire if a real book such as this existed. The power it would give young teenagers would be intoxicating and when things get rough they spiral out of control as they would. The main character, Light- is slightly smarter than most people but not on the ""Genius"" levels the Manga or anime adaption totes around. Which makes things more believable to me. I don't think it was a particularly good movie but I do not think it is as awful as people are proclaiming unless you try to compare it to what ""you"" want. I presume most people when seeing this movie would slate it as not what they wanted, as most people who'd be watching it are those that are fans of the manga/anime. We need to remember to separate expectations with reality. That is not what this movie is, this is a digestible story. That is all."
coreyrocks-cr,Brilliant!!,10/10,24-Aug-18,"This movie is Action-Packed and brings a lot of good vibes along with it along with the characters that you also get tied up with. 
SPOILERS!!!
I especially love the part where Light and his girlfriend are hanging from a Ferris wheel at the end and the story after when Light survives is surrealI suggest this movie to everyone because it is so good and I know you will all enjoy it too!"
antonismagdalinidis,God awful.,01/10,28-Aug-17,"Simply terrible. They missed everything about the original that made it good. The original was about intelligent characters taking well-thought out steps to move around each other without revealing their identities. This film is simply insulting. When will American film makers finally get it right and stick to the spirit of the originals?

rainbowcupcakes-12417,I Don't Know Why Everyone Hates This Movie,08/10,03-Jan-21,"Keep in mind that I have never seen the anime adaption of Death Note, but I plan on watching it soon. But in the meantime, I decided to watch the movie which was conveniently on Netflix.
Now I saw nothing wrong with this movie, I thought it was fascinating and I liked the actors. Sure, the pace could've been slowed down, but it's a movie for a reason. Movies tend to be more fast-paced than shows are.
And of course, compared to an anime, it's gonna be hella different. But that's no reason to bash this movie. I thought it was a pretty damn good movie. Maybe my opinion will change after watching the anime, maybe it won't.

deusdocu,Gets too much hate and comparing to original.,05/10,09-Sep-17,"I think this gets way to much hate.. if you look at ratings you can see this gets more than 20% votes as 1/10, this is clearly haters and fanboys and little kids what do not get what they want. There is honest review from person who have seen original and do NOT want this to be copy paste of it. In general movie is OK, I would give it strong 5.5/10. I like to think of it as inspired of original, rather than movie version of it. If you keep that in mind it is OK. No need to compare it to original... original had something like 20+ episodes, this have one movie. You have to live with what you got and they did pretty good job with it, it is not masterpiece, but still worth the watch, just stay open minded if you are big fan of original.

alkholy81,comparison,07/10,30-Aug-17,"even though it is a remake of another great work I watched it avoiding falling in a comparison to the original works,and if you never see any of death note movies,anime or other literature you will be interested in this movie, that's said the movie makers themselves haunted by the original works which affected the movie in bad way, they should try outside the box but I think they were afraid!

cixzejy,Much Better than Reviews would have you believe,06/10,20-Jul-23,"Let me say first that I have read the manga and seen the anime. (wont be spoiling these go watch them)The direction and effects are some of the best that you'll ever get from a live action anime so I wont touch too much on that. But they are great that alone puts it above 3/10. Its a good looking movie.What I do want to say is that this death note is a Different story from the original. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING. Trying to fit 10 hours into one and a half does not work and is how you get the truly awful adaptations.This death. Note focuses more on the deathnote as a political tool and what one can accomplish with the tool. In this it becomes a more relevant tool for the message it conveys which instead of being about strongly punishing criminals and eradicating crime it focuses on global ""peacekeeping"" and interventionism. It also shows that a large part of the US cultural zeitgeist would largely support someone who kills their geopolitical rivals. Thus becoming a much better theme for the primarily western audience.Overall there are still some shortcomings that come mostly from the fast pacing and general chaos. With most characters and actions being poorly fleshed out. But overall I don't really think it's a waste of time and frankly the fans shouldn't be this pissed about this movie."
mannatjain-45514,Worst Adaptation Ever,01/10,04-Oct-18,"Being a big fan of the Death Note anime series , I am very disappointed by this adaptation of the series. The Netflix movie has changed everything in the story from the very basic nature of every character to even the way they look and thus , ruining the intelligent and elegant storyline of the original series.Netflix has done it again, making one of the best anime series ever into a cliché high school love story with shallow characters and plot loopholes. There is no sophistication in this movie and is not recommended for people who are actually looking for a good storyline.
Ps - It's Light Yagami not Light Turner .

doublee-12635,Worst film ever created,01/10,19-Jun-19,"This is the first review I've ever written for anything...ever. You could honestly watch the entire movie and it would spoil nothing about the anime. Acting was terrible all around. They overplayed the sex scenes, cursing, and gore in a pathetic attempt to cover up the awful production of this film. The actual anime has no sex scenes, no cursing, and, simply put, was good. The main character doesn't even have the same last name. I thought I'd watch it to get a good laugh, but this is honestly offensive. I'm glad to see that this film was a flop. $40,000,000 would've been better spent by burning it than creating this film.

This movie deserves a 10 but it is after all a copy/extension to the original source.So before you leave your hopes with the negative top comments, please I beg of you watch it for yourself, even if you don't enjoy the first minutes watch it till the end and you will either have had a good time or learned what a good movie can give as an impact.

everythingbagelvideos,A competent American remake,06/10,25-Aug-17,"Sorry, this review is kinda rambly and word vomitI do not care that it strays from the original source material. Simply because a remake is different does not make it bad. In fact, if it manages to surprise the viewer by making interesting and unique changes, then I believe it is for the better. Death Note (2017) is not a bad movie. It is well cast for the most part, and the performances are convincing at best, and merely mediocre at worst. The death scenes are by far the best part of the movie. Not only are they gruesome and creative, but they are shot very well. A death scene where the character 'L' is introduced was a standout shot for me, and was very reminiscent of the club scene in Blade. The story is competent, and the idea of a Death Note that can kill anyone in anyway will always be compelling. However, the movie falters when 'L' deducts things. In the anime original we were given most, if not all of the information, and 'L' could actually back up his claims. There is a scene early on where 'L' goes on TV and challenges Kira, the person committing murders on a mass scale, to kill him. After not dying, he says ""Kira wanted to murder me, but couldn't because he didn't know my name"" or something along those lines. There is no way he could know Kira wanted to kill him though. The original anime addressed this by sending out a decoy 'L', which Kira does kill. There are leaps of reason that 'L' make that really kill my suspension of disbelief. Another place where the movie falters is the ""romance"" between Light (Kira) and Mia. While this is definitely not awful, it comes off as a loveless relationship and has no subtlety or originality to it. Unlike the complex relationship of the original anime, there is really nothing here worth thinking about. The decision to make Ryuk cgi was another mistake, as it is he looks right out of a video game, and not a real being. Even though Ryuk doesn't look very convincing, his character has definitely been changed in an interesting way. Originally in the anime Ryuk played more the role of a neutral observer, but in this incarnation he encourages Light to kill his first person. This was an interesting change at the least. I also enjoyed the relationship between Light and his Dad, who's a cop. This was something the original anime did okay, but it wasn't explored as much as I would have liked. It is much more central in this remake, and because they share the loss of a family member, Light's mother. It makes it much more tense when his dad is close to figuring out that Light is Kira.Death Note (2017) is a popcorn flick, and nothing more. It is enjoyable, and the concept will always be entertaining, but don't expect any philosophy or interesting ideas to come out of it. It's worth a watch, and because it's about 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome.6/10Also, Light is kinda dumb in this, but that's okay. It's refreshing to see someone who isn't an ""evil genius"". Mia's pretty dumb as well. So is 'L,' but whatever."
if_u_can_know_me,Hard to imagine a worse film than this,01/10,28-Aug-17,"I think this film clearly shows the difference between the American and Japanese culture. While Americans tend to think smart people are losers, have no social life, aren't accepted by others and are often bullied, the Japanese value smart people and depict them as the cool ones that everyone wants to hang around. Just look at the difference between Light's character in the anime and the movie and you'll know what I'm talking about.

kylemauth,Terrible Movie Adaptation,01/10,31-Aug-17,"The anime was amazing, yet this movie left out all which made the story interesting. Never did the movie reveal Light's motivation, nor did it hold true to any other character.This movie turned an amazing, thoughtful and suspenseful anime into a teenage tragic love story.If it was an original idea the movie would be mediocre with a basic story line and general teen romance drama, but that was not what it should be.There was no character development which made it worse. In the anime there was so much character development you were always questioning everybody's motives and understanding them all.Also, they chose the movie to take place in Seattle, yet only the one or two skyline shots represented the city. After living there it's very annoying there is no accurate representation of the city.Only watch this if you are into teen drama; otherwise, spare yourself!"

mburgerman-382-924751,Had high hopes but was disappointed,04/10,29-Aug-17,"Death note movie... I give it a 5/10 or maybe a 4. This movie is pretty much like the Final Destination movies. Predictable and weak story line, cheesy bad guy and stupid ending. Could have done so much better by making it a mini series. Even the roll of the main detective was weak and had no foundation Come on Netflix, you can do better.

aaroncohick,Death note is fantastic!!!,10/10,26-Aug-17,"Watch it please. These people are over cynical. Nothing makes them happy reviewers. I want a sequel don't let other people ruin & influence your opinions, like they did with ghostbusters remake witch was awesome, you boys need to grow up & get a life. Stop ruining these movies chance for everyone. This is a adaptation of the Japanses movies, look on YouTube. This is not based on the comic versions. Its based on the Japanese movies. These people on here & rotten tomatoes. Are Board, selfish people. Ruing chances of franchised based movies like The lemony Snicket, ghostbusters remake, many movies that were good, just like you people that read books, and don't give movies a chance. Thank god Netflix came long. If people just stopped going into the past, watch something with fresh eyes, your childhood isn't coming back you big baby's, Im so sick of these rotten reviewers. Who have no life. I watched this movie twice loved all the actors. Watch it please! 50 million it Cost to make. employed 1000 people! Thank all the people that make movies / shows available to us

cubic2002,Wow.,01/10,31-Aug-17,"I don't often review it's been years since I have, however, after watching this last night I feel compelled to say that this is awful, really awful. I am a fan of the original anime, which I have seen twice as it is that good, so what makes this particularly bad is that despite having great source material, it somehow misses the mark by miles.I can't really think of one single little thing that I liked about it, I really cannot. What I didn't like about it would take a long time.This is simply a bad bad movie, that is all.

jessicabruhl,Beautiful creative work of Art,08/10,25-Jul-20,This is in my opinion better than the anime. If you want a drawn out story spread out watch the anime. I've watched both I cant say I've seen a better movie adaptation. If you watch the Japanese movie adaptation you'll find they also stopped the story with l vs light.Love the cliffhanger I hope they do even better with the second one.If you really want cheesy go watch dragonball Hollywood version.The anime in my opinion is less realistic offering cheats to learn a person's identity by giving a part of your life up to gain eyes that can read people's names.This movie put more thought into strategies for how light could learn of ones identity to try and kill them.This movie put serious thought of how ones emotions could cause someone to behave in an irrational manner. Watch the movie and expect a good realistic approach to an adaptation of an anime In my opinion done really well.
stfitzg,Lots of the bad reviews are from people who liked the original material,10/10,27-Jul-20,"Look this is a good movie following the premise of a boy who finds a notebook that allows him to kill people. The original source material include a 37 episode anime and a 13 part manga. Based on this the movie producers made a movie that is 1 hour 40 minutes. Of course not all things in the original source couldn't be added. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. Just because it's different from a version you know does not make it bad. If you have never seen the original source material and are interested in the plot this is a good movie. I highly suggest it if you like the plot of the story.

mcrobbbeth,Perfect for dumb monkeys,01/10,28-Aug-17,"No. Just no. Don't even watch. In fact, go and watch the anime, then watch this just to see how bad this film is.They've dropped so many important parts, making the film jumpy and difficult to follow if you have not seen the anime, and changed so many things just to make it fit in with the standard American film, which just makes it bad. This includes the crappy romance going on, the teen angst, and just getting Light's character completely wrong, all just to make it a load of bs just to keep people occupied, but not make them think."
sankriti,absolutely awful,01/10,04-Oct-17,"This movie is cringe-worthy and a total disservice to anime fans. Furthermore the people who made this movie seem to forget Asian American actors who speak perfect English exist. And oh Light Turner..a total character assassination of the incredibly intriguing Light Yagami,nothing can be more cringe-worthy >_<

paulpach,"Disappointing, especially for fans of the anime.",02/10,04-Sep-17,"If you enjoyed the anime, you will hate this movie. The reason the anime works so well is the psychological chess game between Light and L. Each one outsmarts the other at every turn and build up the anticipation for the final face off.All of that is thrown away in the movie. Light is your regular teenager thinking with his genitals. A far cry from the cool and collected genius sociopath in the anime that uses everyone around him and weasel himself out of tight spots.The entire point of the anime is that humans are the real monsters. Ryuk is just there to enjoy the show and eat popcorn (apples). In this movie, Ryuk is the source of evil. So much less compelling.I understand they have to condense the entire series into 2 hours and that is challenging, but in the process they discarded most of what made the anime interesting in the first place.Do yourself a favor, watch the anime instead of this C rated horror movie."
augustinmonrreal,Death note live action film is good not as great but definitely didn't disappoint,09/10,11-Sep-17,I fell in love with the death note series when i had recenly watch it in August. I then was excited to see the movie on metflix. I love the movie. It wasn't that great because it missed a lot of stuff from the anime but i have to say that it show the main idea of how the death note works. You Dee light write the name of the person he is going to killed and you see that there is a force of death that kills the person. Over all good acting from Willem defoe. And great shimigahmi costume.
kodadimet,"Come on guys, relax a bit!",07/10,10-Nov-18,"I personally neither watched the original anime nor read the manga. But i like the movie very much. It's entertaining, suspenseful and dramatic as well. What would u expect more from such a movie? I'm sure if watched the original anime, i would like it very much too. So, don't be so judgemental, leave your prejudice, chill out and enjoy the ride.

donkeycity,Incoherent.,03/10,15-Feb-18,"While I was unfamiliar with the manga, I do have a generally good impression of Adam Wingard, but this was just awful. Very similar to the excellent book Lullaby (which I see predates the comic), and trying to coast by on being kinda Final Destination-y, its far ranging plot never congeals into anything entertaining or particularly comprehensible. Easily the worst film I saw in Oct. 2017 (even though Willem Dafoe was fun, as ever).

rexpectme,This is the worst,03/10,19-Jan-19,Mixed teen drama. The original anime is a masterpiece. This doesn't even come close. They shifted so much from the main story and lost the essence that both Yagami and L were geniuses and not open mad bulls.

If you're looking for a decent movie, (if you are on Netflix it's one of the better ones I've found) this movie is a great thriller. Obviously a B movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. It kept my attention and had a believable ending. Overall I enjoyed watching it

noeawa-92843,"Even taking it as its own, original movie it's complete garbage",01/10,05-Oct-17,"Whatever this movie was going for, it missed the mark completely. It tried to cram too much information that it ended up doing nothing. The characters aren't likable, everyone is impulsive, and no one is grounded in reality. Light is supposed to be smart, even in this universe, but he doesn't show that till the end, and even then it's impulsive. No one is human for this movie that's supposed to be grounded in slight reality. Don't watch this."
tyler15368,Death Note is a failure in the eyes of fans but is a decent film on its own,06/10,28-Aug-17,"Lets just get this out of the way right away. Is the Netflix Death Note as good as the original manga/anime? No.Is it as good as the Japanese live action movies? Well, in terms of staying faithful to the source material, no as well.When I watched this movie for the first time, I found myself enjoying the first half, even with all of the changes made, and there are a lot of them. I find that the complaints about whitewashing are moronic to say the least, because this is a western adaptation and white actors are to be expected and they aren't even the issue with the movie.The second half of the movie is where things begin to fall apart. While the first half has issues as well (mainly with rushing through plot points that were from the source material), the second half is where characters just start to change and everything begins to feel even more rushed than the first half. Some of the things I liked about the movie was L's portrayal. L was done right (for the first half). His mannerisms, how he talks and everything was spot on and I can easily look past the ethnicity change. Willem Dafoe as Ryuk was perfect casting and his portrayal is spot on as well. The movie is also appealing to the eye. It is well shot and directed for the most part. My troubles with the movie come down to a few things.1. It feels rushed because of the short running time. It really should have been 2hrs or longer or an 8-10 episode series instead. 2. Inconsistent tone and characters 3. Cheesy scenes that I'm assuming were unintentional (slowmo and bad acting in certain parts) 4. This is just a personal thing, but I'm not a fan of all of the changes made from the source materialWith all of that said, I gave the film a second viewing to give it a fair shot and to view it as its own thing without so many comparisons to the original. I can say that as it's own thing and for people who aren't familiar with Death Note, it's not a terrible movie. I would say it's average and does have some interesting elements to it.I am interested in seeing where the story could go considering all of the changes made and perhaps Lights character can become the one we all know he is and wanted him to be in this movie moving forward, so I'm not entirely against seeing another one. I feel like everything just boils down to the writing more so than anything else. You can tell that the people involved behind the scenes are fans of Death Note and changes had to be made, but the changes they made take away a lot of the tension and suspense as well as most of the cat and mouse game between Light and L. It tries to be a more ""realistic"" version of the story we know and in some ways, I can understand that and see a more realistic Death Note story being this way but at the end of the day, I feel like following what Death Note is closer than adding new ideas and elements and changing things would have been for the best.This could have been on the level of Breaking Bad or Hannibal in terms of suspenseful story telling and mystery. You see, Death Note is a mystery story (even though the audience knows that Light is Kira). It's about watching Lights journey from trying to do the right thing to becoming an psychopath with a god complex and watching the other characters in the world try to piece together who Kira is and watching Light trying to hide his true persona while being investigated and in some ways, that story translates over but it isn't explored enough because the story is more about Light and Mias relationship instead of just Light. Mia is a fine character, and their relationship matches Lights and Misa's relationship pretty closely except for the fact that Light in the anime was more abusive and cared very little about Misa and only used her for his personal gain. In this movie, they take some of Lights traits away and give them to Mia and I think the only reason for this is because if she didn't have these traits, she would just be a damsel in distress, pretty woman without any real characteristics (which would have caused SJW's to freak out and there would be a huge backlash not just from fans, but SJW's and white knights everywhere).Moving forward, if there is a sequel, I would like to see Light develop into the character we know him as (as the events of this film can certainly change him into that person). More of a mind battle between L and Light (even though L knows without absolute certainty that he is Kira at this point). Light and Ryuk's ""friendship"" explored better and tone down the high school coming of age story as well as tone down painting Light to be a good guy. Light is a good guy that loses his way and becomes the very thing he wants to destroy. As an adaptation, I would give this movie a 5/10. As it's own thing, I would say a 6 or 7/10 is a pretty fair score. It's not nearly as bad as some people are saying but it's not the perfect adaptation either. Give it a chance Death Note fans, maybe you'll find something in it you enjoy."

tamtubeoo,Just awful,01/10,10-Oct-17,"This is the kind of awful movie, that makes you create an account to rate it as low as possible. If you watch it, you are going to have a bad time! The actor choices were poorly chosen. Ryuk was the only good actor, where as I liked the actor playing L, but the director also managed to screw that up. Light however was an all-round awful actor playing an awful made character.And what is up with the 1980 music? Just because Strangers things did it, suddenly you have all these talent-less fools copying successful movies... And it makes no sense to implement 1980 music at all in this movie. I for once can not follow how the movie should take place in the 80's? I guess everything has to take place in the center of the world, implementing used up clichés - 10/10 in originality, bravo Netflix! - Kinda sets a bad mark on the Netflix ""Originals"" theme."
leilarem-76971,literal garbage why was this made,01/10,04-Mar-21,"I just made an account to say how bad this movie was. I wasn't even 30 minutes into the movie and I dropped it. It absolutely sucks. The acting, casting, storyline, the only good thing about this movie is Ryuks voice. And ryuks character sucks as well. In the anime/manga ryuk is bored and in this garbage he enjoys seeing people get killed. That's not even close. Mia who I guess is supposed to be misa is your average basic cheerleader following their crush. And then she turns into some crazy person. This is embarrassing for the anime/manga, it shouldn't even have the title Death Note. I don't even have words for this so called movie it shouldn't even have been made I would give negative stars if I could. Don't waste your time on whatever this is.

nicolazingg,Took everything and made it American,01/10,26-Oct-17,"I am a really fan of Death Note. I read the Manga and watched the Anime. A lot of people told me not to watch the movie but I didn't listen to them and said I have to watch it for myself to make me an opinion. I should have listen to them. They where right, they where so right about that. They took this masterpiece of a movie and made basically an American version of it. I mean I understand if you set the whole movie in America instead of Japan but you don't have to change the attitude of the characters. They didn't represent the characters like they where. The thing that shocked me the most was the main character Light Yagami or now in this American version Light Turner. He is just such a douchebag in this movie.Spoilers: He is afraid when he first saw the Deathgod Ryuk and didn't wanted to use the Death Note. I mean are you serious? In the Manga/Anime even Ryuk was surprised how fast he figured out how the Death Note works and how many people he had killed before he introduced himself to Light. And if the movie wouldn't be bad enough, they had to give him a girlfriend, who ended up having more balls to use the Death Note and be the villain then Light.All in all it is a bad movie and I don't recommend you to watch the movie if you are a fan of the original one."
trashmail-72817,Ignore the hype of bashing video game and anime adaptations. This movie is OK!,06/10,27-Aug-17,"Critics tend to be harsh when it comes to anime and video game adaptations. Ignore that! This movie is not perfect... it's not great... it's not very good... But it's OK. Good for a boring Sunday evening at home. Note: The actor portraying L did a very good Job.I wonder why critics say this movie is that bad. Is it because they've seen L being portrayed by someone they didn't want to see as L? Or because it genuinely is a bad movie? Do critics say this movie is that bad for the sake of bashing anime and video game adaptations? Or again; because it genuinely is a bad movie? I personally think it is the latter.I enjoyed it! 6,3/10"
mkobriens,too rushed,05/10,26-Aug-17,"It plays out like an average psychological drama and then it randomly shifts into mystical drama saying that the kira kills with psychic powers just does not seem to fit with the movie and sounds like it was a joke. It only takes L five minutes to figure out Light is Kira there is no build up or actual detective work he just shows up and decides yea that's the guy. The only plus I give to it is that it is filmed well and interesting to look at though I would have preferred a practical Ryuk.

Leah1387,This adaptation is a disgrace to the manga & anime,01/10,19-Jun-21,"Awful. Only live action anime that's worst than this dumpster fire is Dragon Ball: Evolution.This adaptation was just horrendous. It's one of my favourite mangas/anime. Only thing I was alright with was Willem DeFoe's take on Ryuk. Even then it just wasn't the same & I love DeFoe.So I highly recommend reading & watching those instead.

Eldritch,Missed opportunity,04/10,28-May-21,"Of course, fans of the original anime and of the manga have many bones to pick with this production. It deviates from the canon and not only it doesn't add, but it also subtracts from a well told story. That is not why this movie failed miserably. It failed miserably on its own. The production clearly has some talent behind it: Atticus Ross on the soundtrack and the dark cinematography, which in spite of playing some clichés, it give an interesting atmosphere to the story. And there's the rub: the story. The screenplay is the weakest and there's no reason for it being so poor given that the manga offered so much material. It was sad to see this movie implode.

novaguo,Cringy and Whitewashed,01/10,04-Jan-22,"I'm not adding anything new so this is kind of pointless but whatever. So, I get that not everything has to be about racism, but I feel like casting non Asians for this is a bit... whitewashy. Especially since the originals were clearly Japanese(I mean come on, how is Yagami NOT a Japanese surname?) And I'm not speaking from the perspective of an SJW, I myself am East Asian so I should be able to speak on this. Casting white people for the roles is taking opportunities away from Asians, which already barely have a presence in western movies. Anyways, enough with the race thing. I have things against the movie itself. The acting was quite poor, watching it made me feel very uncomfortable. It was forced and some things were way overplayed. It also deviated a lot from the original source material.

nickgee-25390,How did they think this is what fans wanted?,01/10,13-Jan-22,"(Possible spoilers may follow, but the movie isn't worth watching anyway. Read below to find out why)I'm not a huge anime fan to be honest. But I incidentally found and started watching the death note anime this week and finished it within a few days. I absolutely loved it; I haven't watched another show as good as this.Naturally, when I was done, I needed more. And I found this movie. There are three other live action movies made in Japan that I believe follow the source material pretty well, but I haven't watched those yet.I like other Netflix movies, like arq, and iboy so I had some level of faith that this would be a decent movie at worst. I've never been more wrong about anything in my life.Everything about this movie is wrong. What they've done is taken the basic premise (somehow even botching that), and created a new, much less interesting or engaging story. The characters have next to no motivation, and absolutely no depth.""Wrong"" counter:1. They changed character names to be American.2. They changed character motivation.3. They changed character personalities.4. They completely didn't include many supporting characters.5. No second kira.6. Kira's personality has been changed so that now he is a bullied nerd, who actually doesn't even want to kill people, unless they are a criminal. My guess is that they wanted to present Kira as more altruistic than he is. But what that actually achieved was the existence of a one dimensional kira, who had no sense of self preservation, which in the anime, played heavily into how the events of the source material flowed.7. Stupid foot chase scene.8. In the source material, L was presented as very slow moving, articulate, rational, and highly intelligent. Almost devoid of emotion type of genius. In this movie, he jitters around a lot, jumps awkwardly, and not shown in general to be very articulate or rational.9. Music doesn't fit.10. Ryuk doesn't grow somewhat attached to kira and is much less present. Also, nobody else can see him even if they touch the book. He does still like apples though.11. There is no cat and mouse or battle of wits between L and kira and when they do meet, it seems rather abrupt and nonsensical.12. The movie just paints everything wrong.Whoever wrote this should be banned from making any adaptation movies. This is so bad that I want to rate it 0 but I can't so it gets a 1.Apparently Netflix is working on a sequel and the new writer says he loves death note and wants to bring it back to the source material, but honestly I really don't see how they're going to dig their way out of this one.This is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I watched the one warrior, and hobo with a shotgun."
leorojasma,"I discover that the haters are hating it because they already saw something from death note before and compare it, its not fair",10/10,02-Sep-17,"I generally never write on these reviews, but today i was compelled as i discover something.I know death note for a long time, but never has seen the anime, nor the other movies, nothing...This movie was my first approach to death note and i LOVE IT!!! I fall in love with the history and the movie in general was between scary and funny, was very good in my opinion.What did i discover?That you will love the movie if you haven't seen anything yet about death note, but all the haters that i saw on these reviews, always compare it with the other titles.Now i do want to see them, but for now, this is my first approach and i love it so far.You have to try see this kind of adaptations the most objectively possible to make a good review."
Stormrain90,Death Note but not?,08/10,25-Jan-18,"Is it a straight up adaptation changed slightly for an American audience? My answer is NO. While keeping a similar theme to the Death Note that we all know the characters I find is where the biggest difference lies. I don't mind these changes as they make a story I know all too well having watched the anime, Japanese movies and read the manga a bit different. Light Turner is NOT Light Yagami (popular, brilliant, heartthrob) instead we're given a boy who does others' homework for money because why not, he's clever what else should he do with that intelligence perhaps he plans to use that money to get away from his home life which is made uncomfortable by his relationship with his father.When he finally gets going using the note, he reacts as I'd expect any normal teenager to do; thinks he's doing good getting rid of people who hurt others and now that he has this power and is finally somebody perhaps he can even get the popular girl he's got his eye on. Ryuk was perfect in that throughout the entire movie he's never straight with light on his intentions and allows Light to question whether he's just uncaring or outright playing him. Light too is a lot more concerned with the morals of his choices; killing bad guys is one thing but when it comes to people just doing their job who could threaten him he's a lot more hesitant which I hope most people would be. Mia is an interesting character in that she's completely devoted to her way of thinking and is able to do things that Light isn't because she's only concerned with the ends justifying any means.The original is focused on the cat and mouse drama of two super intelligent people trying to outdo each other from opposite sides of the fence. Whereas this Light when cornered panics like most would and reacts with half thought out ideas to get him through. The L here, although as intelligent as his counterpart, is still human enough to be swayed by bursts of anger and emotion. Many will feel that straying so far from the original source material is inexcusable but I personally was able to enjoy this in a way that was different from the anime and manga where my main concern was how Light would counter whatever clever trap L had for him. Sometimes I'd forget that they are supposed to be real people dealing with ethical issues people have grappled with since society began."
jistbinw,Not bad,10/10,17-Feb-19,"I am a fan of the death note anime and believe this movie was trying to put their perspective on it, rather than trying to make it exactly like the anime, if anyone gets what I mean and I really enjoyed the movie and so did my friend.

matthew-schon-morgan,"simply put, not for fans of the original",01/10,05-Sep-17,"Death Note has a handful of characters and plot points in common with its source material, but it's not the same animal. Ryuk is portrayed as a villain. Light is just a mixed-up kid here. ""L' is made into a mostly still L amalgam of all the detectives. The fun Mensa challenge of using established lore to figure out the next move if you were fast enough is gone. There's none of the fun comedy relief, either. Does the thought of Ryuk eating an apple make you happy right now? Then don't watch this. Furthermore, as a standalone experience to newcomers, there isn't much of anything here to enjoy. Everything but Ryuk's look and the satisfying portrayal of ""L"" feels lazy."
iamjebee,Being different from the original is not wrong,09/10,22-Feb-18,"As a fan of the original Death Note anime I am very pleased about this film. They have completely different lengths and dimensions, so it's not surprising that the film would have to abandon some details or make some changes to tell the story. I loved the fresh CGI of Ryuk and Lakeith Stanfield verison of L. I also found Americanised background fun and it gave Death Note more possibilities, like it could work in different cultures. Some of the acting could be improved, but overall it was still entertaining. Being different from the original is not wrong, after all.

SoulReaper13D,"If you defend this atrocity, you're part of the problem.",01/10,03-Apr-22,"Wow, wtf happened with this movie? Death Note is one of the greatest anime/manga of all time, so why was such a terrible live-action version ever green-lit? I knew this film was an epic fail the moment that Light screamed like a little girl at the sight of Ryuk. That scene was both depressingly painful and unintentionally hilarious to watch. Almost EVERY decision Light and L make in this movie are completely out of character from their anime counterparts and stupid beyond reason. Mia is essentially the exact opposite of her original version, instead of a light-hearted goth girl we get a psychotic cheerleader, ugh. The characters, the style, the plot, the intensity of the cat-and-mouse game, basically everything that made the anime so great is ruined in this film. Some of the death scenes are absurdly over-the-top as if the director just binge-watched the entire Final Destination series and thought the same formula would work here. Unfortunately Death Note is even worse than those films. The 80's music only makes it feel even cheesier, as they try to mimic Donnie Darko as well and still end up with a trashy teen horror flick. The movie even breaks the very rules of the Death Note itself. This isn't only a bad anime adaptation, it's just a bad movie period. Cringy dialogue, lame action set-pieces, terrible movie logic, and worst of all Ryuk is hardly even in it! Willem Dafoe is actually a good choice for Ryuk but he's portrayed as some kind of maniacal puppet-master, which is NOT what he ever was in the show. Do yourself a favor and skip this hot mess."
kaiklose,disappointment,01/10,25-Aug-17,i've watched both the anime and the movie and no i will not be comparing them because the movie does not give the same feel as the anime and is not even close to the original story. i'm writing this just to describe how much of a crappy movie this turned out to be.. the story went on too fast light seemed like an idiot + Light is supposed to be a sociopath not a kid who falls in love with a cheerleader..i honestly was very disappointed in how this movie turned out..

danielachoreshmv,Awful and disgraceful.,03/10,27-Aug-17,"They took the classic, philosophic masterpiece and turned it into a typical Hollywood movie. The actor casting is terrible, not to mention they're just bad actors in general. And I'm not talking about L being black or actors not being Asian, that's just called diversity. They just genuinely don't fit. For example, Light is supposed to be the popular successful handsome kid that has a bright future, a kid that is getting all the girls, a kid that blends in easily, and a kid that no one will ever assume to be a killer.Hollywood, stop making movie adaptations!BUT! There is a big but. For someone that has never seen the original anime or read the manga, that is just a nice movie about a crazy kid that gets the ultimate power. I won't lie, it is a decent movie, but It's not AT ALL Death Note.

anastasiasmarandi,Really exceeded my expectations,07/10,27-Aug-17,"As a fan of the original anime, I was prepared for the worst. Despite of that, the movie actually surprised me. I did not read the manga, but I am certain the movie was inferior to the original story. However, it was not a complete disaster for a 2 hour action movie (compared to the long story depicted in the manga and adapted in the anime). One of the things that bothered me was the character of Light Turner. In the anime, Light Yagami was a brilliant, high-functioning sociopath with a God complex and I would've liked to see more of that, instead of the misunderstood edgy teen, although it worked with the plot of the movie. I think Mia's character was quite well built, as opposed to L whose back story could've been exploited a little more. There are also some Hollywood clichés throughout the movie, but nothing bothered me too much. I actually prefer the cheesy love story between Mia and Light instead of Misa and Light's relationship in the anime.The worst part about this movie is how lightly (pun not intended) it treats the whole concept behind it. I would've liked to see a more in depth analysis of this fight between Light's justice and L's justice. It ignored the psychological implications of the Death Note in Light's life which was a big part of the story: the way he becomes alienated by the power he holds. Instead, it showed the destruction of his relationship with Mia. While being a relevant point, it's not nearly as moving and powerful as the original. All in all, I believe that Death Note(2017) is enjoyable if viewed as a story inspired by the manga and the anime, instead of an adaptation. It kept me on the edge of my seat and was an overall good experience."
tigerdyr2004-646-627036,Brilliant Movie,08/10,28-Mar-19,"What an awesome brilliant movie. I really liked it, because it's of the suspension, the caracters and the plot itself. I have not seen the manga/anime series, so I cant compare them, but if you're looking for a movie to entertain and capture you, you have to see this movie.One of ""Netflix Originals"" best movies.

punkygirlanne,Garbage,01/10,05-Jan-19,"The actors are kinda bad, the story is very low and the movie is so boring, that I thought it will never end. Hated it.Ryuk is the best, come over and give me the death note to write some names in it"
alexlunabunny,Not worth watching,01/10,15-Sep-18,"As a huge Death Note fan, at first I was half looking forward to watching this movie, and half dreading it. Turns out I was right with the latter. The acting was just about B- movie worthy, the plot was beyond predictable, and seemed to be really dumbed down compared to the Anime, manga and Japanese films. The only good thing was Ryuks voice by William Dafoe. All in all I really wish Americans would stop remaking Japanese/Korean anime's/films as they just butcher them.

Jamarama97,Absolutely Awful and Unnecessary Live Action Adaptation,01/10,08-Sep-17,"This is the first review I have ever written on IMDb and have been compelled to do so because of how dire an adaptation of the much beloved 'Death Note' manga series this film is. I have watched the 2006-2007 TV series and that was intelligently written and beautifully made, it ranks as one of the best TV series ever made, live action series included. With that series we didn't need any remakes as we had already been given an incredible and faithful adaptation of the manga series. Yet since then we've been given remakes and none worse and more unnecessary than this 2017 abomination. The characters have been defiled with an abysmal script and poor acting. Nat Wolff (Light Turner) and Lakeith Stanfield (L) are particularly awful. The character of Light Yagami is now Light Turner and he comes across as painfully ignorant and reckless. The sophistication of the original character who only cares about achieving his ultimate goal is forgotten and thus begins a ridiculous Hollywood cliché relationship with Margaret Qualley (Mia Sutton). Whilst I appreciate this is a film and not a TV series so there isn't the same time allowed for more detail, that just begs the question of why did we get this remake other than quite obviously, it's a successful franchise holding the key for a safe return of money if remade regardless of the outcome. Even with considerably less time for a fully detailed adaptation the writers Charley Parlapanides, Vlas Parlapanides and Jeremy Slater have completely altered their screenplay to cater for western mainstream audiences and in turn have defiled a great series. Too little detail given, too many plot holes and the decision to change the characters names and setting destroy any of the charm that the 'Death Note' series has. The soundtrack is terrible not suiting the moods of the scenes alongside a particular decision to overuse slow-motion technology which leads to you wanting the nightmare of this film to end. Willem Dafoe (Ryuk) and Shea Whigham (James Turner) give the only redeeming performances in the film and even they are having to try their best with an atrocity of a script. It really does seem that Willem Dafoe was brought onto the production for his trademark Green Goblin laugh from the Tobey Maguire Spiderman films. The cinematography was decent but with everything else so poor it gives little to the film if anything. The film feels it lacked any real direction and everyone was hoping for a quick turnover, talk of a sequel film should be quashed instantly, no thank you. The CGI of Ryuk was alright and I suppose credit should be given there but not to much else. To conclude, this film was completely unnecessary and should be shown in film studies classes for how not to adapt a written series to film."
jsalinas-22364,Either watch the scenes with just Ryuk or stick to watching the original,01/10,29-Dec-19,"If there's one thing most people can agree on, there are two kinds of things Hollywood sucks at making live-action adaptations of: video games and anime. And it's more painful when the original source material is just so damn good. So long story short: Death Note (2017) is absolute crap.The characters are poorly acted and way too Americanized. While Light Yagami was admired for being a nerd, Light TURNER (yes, like Timmy Turner) is made fun of for being a nerd because this is America. L is played by the admittedly talented Lakeith Stanfield but was so horribly miscasted, appearing more as a self-parody that exists only to show how much Hollywood loves diversity. This movie's version of Misa Amane (now named Mia Sutton) is some emotionless control freak with dominance over Light because once again: America. This movie simply wasn't brave enough to show the damaging psychological effects of an abusive, manipulative relationship as the kind between Light and Misa in the original anime did. Instead, it comes off as laughable, much like most of this movie's attempts at being serious. Even the death scenes are laughable, especially since they're more reminiscent of Final Destination than the original show's method of heart attacks, which made it that much harder to see the supernatural elements behind Light's hunt.However, this movie had exactly ONE redeeming point: Willem Dafoe as Ryuk. While Ryuk suffers from slight personality changes (mainly that he's more sinister here rather than a neutral onlooker to Light's crimes), he's undoubtedly the most fun thing in the movie, and Dafoe was the absolute perfect choice to play him. He's creepy, shrouded in mystery, and enjoyable mischievous; and you'll probably enjoy watching a compilation of just his scenes on Youtube WAY more than this movie as a whole.In conclusion, this is a disappointment to anyone who's a fan of the original anime, but Willem Dafoe's presence was a treat."
nickschweiss,Everything about this movie is garbage but it gets a 4 for it's production quality.,04/10,11-Sep-17,"So instead of Light Yagami, it's now Light Turner. Instead of Misa, it's now Mia. Everything takes place in Seattle, Mia and Light fall in love in the first five minutes of the movie, L figures out Light is Kira about 15 minutes in, also instead of Ryuk being completely apathetic he is actively attempting to sabotage everything Light does. It would've been a bold adaptation if they attempted to scrutinize the themes of the original anime in American context, but they never attempt to do anything beyond yet another Hollywood-ized knock off of great Japanese entertainment. The only reason I give this a 4/10 is because the cinematography was really good and the mise en scene for all the shots were really well done. On top of that Ryuk's CGI was really cool and of course Willem Dafoe never disappoints in anything. Other than that, don't waste your time.

kwing-69245,Decent Film (Don't believe the Manga haters!),07/10,05-Sep-17,"I saw the score for this film and thought ""Wow"", it must be bad! However, it turns out the vast majority of reviews are written from Manga folk, lovers of the original. If your like me, you don't watch manga cartoons and have never heard of this film before, this is what I am basing the review on.In it's own right, this film is worth a watch. It's definitely different with a unique story line. The characters are likable, and the story line is more than enough to hold your attention throughout the film. The ending was decent and more than that I like the soundtrack to the film, it's very well done.You don't need to know a gargantuan amount of details just that this film is much better than the overall score currently allocated, and well worth a watch if you fancy something different. Just don't believe all the manga haters who think everyone is into cartoons and have seen the original."
itaieinhorn,The worst movie i've ever seen,01/10,28-Aug-17,"I never felt the need to write reviews in this site but after seeing this sorry excuse for a movie i just had to sign up and warn peopleTL;DR: I feel like my TV needs to be quarantined and sanitized for 60 days before i can watch anything on it again. Save your soul (and time) and stay away from this piece of crap!I watched the anime, i liked it, but i don't consider myself a fan boy. I also have problems with fan boy reviews and i tend to ignore them simply because they are over protective of the source material and tend to complain about irrelevant issues. I knew that this movie can't be a complete replica of the anime because it's just too short. I also knew there were going to be changes so more people (and not just anime junkies) can relate to.So i decided to ignore all the whiny reviews about how different the characters are and the changed plot etc etc, And watch this as a stand alone movie, i mean a movie about ""a mysterious notebook with the power to kill anyone whose name is written inside it"", can't really be that bad, right? I was so wrong...I'm not going to compare it to the anime (unlike most of the reviews here), but here are some inputs:The characters are bad, i couldn't relate to any of the characters: - The main character (light) is a whiny spineless teenager who somehow everyone think is smart, but he just makes me want to throw up every time he pops on screen - His ""girlfriend"" is a homicidal maniac with no real motive - L, the ""brilliant"" investigator is just someone who had a mental breakdown. The plot is BORING, inconsistent, looks like someone just puked on a piece of paper and they took it into production. a LOT of cringe moments. My eyes still hurt from all the flashing lights in this movie (probably to disguise the crappy production). And the music... Are you guys deaf? what the hell is wrong with you?Even if someone tried really hard to create the worst movie ever, it wouldn't even come close to this piece of crap. How can any person with some dignity can take any part in this? how can anyone in their right mind agree to participate in this hall of shame entree?The score (4.7 when writing this) is an insult to any movie above 2, i can only guess that the people who gave high rating to this thing are getting their paychecks from Netflix, So, Netflix, I would suggest spending your money on other things (like the movie itself) instead of wasting it here.To anyone reading this, Please, Please don't watch this, if i could save just one innocent person from wasting his time on this garbage then the time i wasted on this movie and the review was worth it."
Badranchi,If Light was a little bitj,05/10,13-Feb-21,"I think this movie is quite funny. It's very different from the original manga, but I think they did that on purpose since they want to target different audience. I notice they make Light Yagami a little cowardy and comical in the movie which was weird because I'm familiar with the cool level headed Light. At some points its funny but I get how people are mad because of that alone. Apart from the differences from the popular manga I think it is an okay but below average movie. If you're a teenager who didn't know about the manga/anime I think you will find this movie okay. But try to check the original anime it will blow your mind away.

db-10970,A disappointing attempt to recreate a fantastic Anime/Manga,04/10,26-Aug-17,"Positives: A somewhat talented cast. Decent Cinematography. Distinctive Direction by Adam Wingard. L's character (at least until the last 10 min) Ryuk's character. Half of Watari's character. At times paying homage to the Anime/Manga. Half of Light's character. Negatives: Light and Mia's Confusing relationship. Very rushed passing. Bad script with many plot holes. Other half of Light's character. Mia's character. Other half of Watari's character. Terrible ending. Conclusion: A disappointing (although not terrible) attempt to recreate a fantastic Anime/Manga

Amifterbifty,Most people are untimately sheep,07/10,15-Sep-18,"Many reviewers write about how this movie isn't true to the original story. They have absolutely compelling reasons for their opinion. They're great at 'selling' their views. More people get on board and truly believe in the original reviewer's vision. Because, of course, the reviewer is superb at 'selling' their opinions. It's such a shame. It's almost a travesty, in the wider view. The original anime is truly awesome. 
This movie is good in it's own right. Not awesome, but definitely enjoyable.The stupidly low user-rating is a shame. 
This is not a bad movie.
It just made me ask the eternal questions - why does the majority of civilisation act like sheep? Why is it so difficult for the majority of people to think with true perspective?

windsoflight,Why ruin a great thing?,03/10,30-Aug-17,"TLDR; Don't watch this. Even if you have no familiarity with the original story, this is horribly done on every level.** SO MANY SPOILERS ** I loved the manga and the anime. I'm excited for the Japanese live action. When I heard Netflix came out with this, I was excited... til I actually saw it. I'm writing this as I watch it. Let's break it down: Now, I'm going to ignore the changes that technically have no bearing on the story, such as this takes place in America instead of Japan. While in the Japanese, Light's last name was a sort of pun, they changed it here, but it's not important to the story, so I'll ignore it. Here, his mother is dead and there's no sign of his sister, which isn't necessary to the story, but seems like an odd change.The movie opens with Light selling test answers. Already, this is a major issue. Original Light does what he does because he believes in right, in justice, in the law, and wants to pick up where the law leaves off. Selling test answers goes against everything Light is and believes. New Light swears frequently and violently, gets into fistfights, gets detention, and rather than test out the Note, he dives right in with a violent, gory death. This is just the first few minutes! Willem Dafoe makes a great Ryuk, although they creeped him out and took away the humor from him. They changed some rules of the Note and added some, including that touching the Death Note no longer enables people to see Ryuk; they have to actually be the keeper of the Note. Apparently, Ryuk is the one who does the killing; Light just orders him around by writing in the book and forcing him to do things, which ticks Ryuk off, so why would he want to drop the Note? 20 minutes in, Light decided, why be secretive? The first girl who looks at him --Mia -- gets to know about the Death Note. She's a ""rebel;"" you can tell because she smokes during P.E. So hardcore. Even though she's a... cheerleader? Because sure.Light isn't the intelligent, calculating young man that made Death Note so interesting. He's an easily-terrified, horny teen. He actually asks Mia how he's supposed to kiss people! He and Mia seem to get off from killing people. Seriously; they make out or have sex while talking about who to kill or while actually killing people. When he stops killing, Mia leaves him. She decides he can't handle it, and will kill him unless she gets the Death Note.He isn't well-educated or from a good family; his father's a drunk and they live near the train. Rather than consider every move and possible outcomes, Light kills without discrimination and then panics when he realizes it's possible to get caught.Rather than the world come together over Kira, Light forces people to write ""Kira"" before they die to push them into worshiping him as a god.L is played by a black dude, which I have no issue with, and he speaks Japanese really well, so Netflix gets points for that. He keeps the pronunciation of ""Kira"" throughout the movie. He moves and holds himself like L does. I like Watari as well. Masi Oka gets to be in it as Detective Sasaki, for all of 3 seconds.The entire movie is overly gory. L and Light don't go back and forth in a battle of wits. L doesn't follow any sort of logic. He just magically knows things, like he knows Light is Kira, although he has no evidence, no thought process to back it up. He shows up in front of Light, and Light doesn't keep his cool, doesn't trick L, doesn't do anything except freak out and basically admit that he's Kira.One change I like is that this Light thought to use Watari against L. L's response when he realizes it is great as well, but then he loses his cool and flips out. He manages to suddenly know what happened to Watari, even though they, again, never explain how he knows. Seeing L struggle when presented with the opportunity to use the Note was interesting, but still felt out of character.You'll get sick of Light complaining about all the rules. In the manga, the rules were few and they made sense. Here, there are about 100, and Light constantly whines about the loopholes and how hard it is to keep it all straight.** ENDING SPOILERS ** How is the great L taken down? By a dude with a 2x4. How does the amazing Kira go out? By a lover's quarrel. The music that plays as he and Mia fall from a Ferris wheel makes this movie a parody. No Misa-Misa, no second book, no Near. His father finding out and being like, ""Oh, okay"" really irks me as well.Horribly done. Incredibly disappointed. Even as a stand alone, this movie makes no sense and is terribly done."
mourningryze,Do not watch this if you've you seen or read the original source material..,03/10,25-Aug-17,"(The following is relative to the anime) Pros: -Ryuk special effects (kind of) -At least has a watered down version of when Light expertly plans his reconvene with his book again -Also the watered down version of how L pinpoints the location of 'Kira' (Debatably a pro) -Willem DaFoe was a great cast for the voice (imo)Cons: -Cast is completely changed from the original material, 'Whitewashed' as it's known -Light is weak and nerdy teenager, not an intellectual prodigy who is also an elite sportsmanThe only links to the original source material are the characters names and the fact Ryuk eats apples. This reproduction completely throws out the main idea, leaving the killing down to a homicidal character known as Mia and a 'down on his luck moody teenager', of which they somehow manage to kill 400 people in a matter of minutes in the movie? Yeah, the time-line is a little broken but this coincides with L tracking down Light in a very short time frame as well. I found Ryuk to be a mysterious figure for most of the movie as he never really reveals himself and generally is supposed to have a scary demeanor which I don't really agree with; The movie sways between a flicker of the source material and doing it's own thing, and if it had of done it's own thing I would have praised it a lot higher but instead they generally just incorporate the notable scenes from the anime and loosely link the rest of it together through scenes of utter disarray. Trying to put such a narrative into a 1 hour 41 minute viewing is just impossible and really should've been taken with a different approach, for instance if they had made it with a different story-line it could've been interesting, but trying to cram the 'entire' series into a movie was a foolish move.."
mail-58377,Watch the Anime,01/10,25-Aug-17,"This movie was just terrible, the acting for Light and L was bad, they changed things from the source material that didn't need to be changed, but made far less sense in the movie. I am a big fan of the anime, but didn't have high hopes for a live action movie, I am still disappointed. It was more gory horror movie than anything, except it wasn't scary. The first interaction between Light and L was just nonsense. Do yourself a favor, save an hour and a half of your life and skip this.

vectorequinox,Terrible,02/10,20-Feb-18,"This mess of a film is worth watching if you thought that death note was over-rated. Or you could watch it as a comedy then it becomes quite good sadly. Just don't go into it expecting any quality. Oh and don't complain about the white washing if that is your problem here then you haven't watched the movie.

mbb-24511,Completely Unnecessary,02/10,12-Oct-20,"If you wanted to watch this then you probably were a fan of the original anime series or the manga which it was based on. This movie has little to nothing in common with either of those. It has some similar characters and a couple of similar ideas and scenes but it takes a bizarrely different tone while trying to behave as if it's on the same level as the anime series.The most baffling thing about this movie to me is why they chose to try and re-create the original series when that has dozens of hours of story told over 2 seasons of television in a film format in about 2 hours. The premise is simple: An intellectually gifted high school student is given the power to kill whoever he wants by writing their name down in the Death Note, a power granted by a chaotic neutral entity named Ryuk. The original series was a cleverly written game of cat and mouse between Light, the owner of the Death Note, and L, the equally smart detective who's out trying to find him. This movie tries pretending it's clever while also presenting itself as a pseudo-Final Destination type movie.The question I was left with after finishing the movie is ""Why bother trying to retell the anime's story? Why not tell something original within this universe?"" The setup is simple and can go in any direction. If from the get go the film made it clear that this would be a unique spin on the Death Note story with little to no direction being taken from the source material then I'd be more willing to give it some leeway. Why bother setting up a similar story with similar characters in the movie if you aren't going to pay respect to the source material and make them behave irrationally? That isn't the way to please the fan base, and you aren't telling a good story while trying to tell the original Death Note story and a thriller at the same time.Every action the main characters take is questionable or laughable by the end of the movie. The plot comes down to contrivances which get so convoluted it's ridiculous, all based on one relatively obscure rule within the Death Note which the writers greatly speculate on in order to make the plot happen at all. I want to applaud the writers for trying something different but at the same time they ruined that by dragging in characters from the original which only opens this up to criticisms by allowing direct comparisons to the anime. Ultimately this is just a waste of time and not worth the frustration of sitting through."
Hollis87,horrible movie,01/10,28-Aug-17,"this movie is nothing like the Anime. How Light is portrayed is this movie is completely different than the Anime, for 1 he seems like a whiny teen instead of the sociopath he actually is. How L was portrayed was OK until about the middle of the movie and then he got to emotional and did things that if you area fan of the Anime you know wouldn't happen. they also only covered about half of the series which was kind of annoying. All in All the movie sucked and I had to watch the show to get the movie outta my head.

konradabramczuk,Abysmal remake,02/10,26-Aug-17,"While the originals managed to grab people's attention; Japanese movies, manga, & anime, the remake manages to artfully destroy beautifully crafted world created by the Mangaka in a true western fashion. The characters are easily forgettable, the plot itself only grasps the core concept, while omitting details which made death note a hit in Japan. Please be aware that this is my personal opinion and some people may find it at least entertaining, however most who at least read the story or seen the movies will at least, partially agree that western remakes just fail to recreate the original plots to expected standard/"
doritoxxx,This movie isn't that bad,06/10,06-Sep-17,"It's by no stretch of the imagination a masterpiece, however it is definitely not as terrible as people will make you believe. Problems arise when people compare the protagonists from the movie (Light Turner) and the one from the source material (Light Yagami). They are in the end and pretty much from the beginning completely different characters. I believe this is the deterrent that has put off the Death Note fans (and there's a lot of them) from enjoying this film as Light Turner is a lot less likable than Light Yagami for many reasons. At times it's way too fast paced and they try to make this edgy teenage tumblr 2012 gore blog relationship happen; even to the extent that they add in a normal people scare me sign in the locker of Light's girlfriend. This in my opinion is the greatest crime the film commits. It's cringe inducing and feels forced, it has the feel of a 40 year old man trying to understand teenagers on the internet. However the negatives aside the film is shot absolutely fantastically, it's glowing effects and stunning visuals would make this film watchable by themselves. I'd watch it, it's entertaining enough if you can get off your high horse, take off your fedora and not get annoyed over your precious anime.6/10 a good waste of an hour or however long this film lasted"
StephenBuckNet,Avoid,01/10,01-Sep-17,"Death Note (2017): Avoid.This ""retelling"" of Death Note completely destroyed the original. In the original, Light was intelligent, resourceful, and cunning. In this retelling, he is the stereotypical not-so-bright American teen who can only think with the brain inside the tiny head inside his pants. In the original, Mia was not too bright and extremely annoying in a way that you actually like her because she is so annoying. In this retelling Mia sends a powerful message that American females are using their males for sex to satisfy personal ambitions. It's one thing to adapt a cult-favorite story from one culture (Japanese) to another (American), but this is no adaptation, this is best described by a word I cannot include in this written review.To say that this movie is terrible is an understatement.If this movie appeals to you, then I strongly encourage you to watch the anime series before you watch this movie. The anime is thousands of times better than this movie."
hellblazer619,About as much fun as having piles,01/10,21-May-18,"The mole on the lead actors face was more interesting then this turkey!!! What an absolute waste of talent can't believe how bad this was

mrsubsniper,"We need a ""Delete Note"", so we can write this movie down in it and delete it from the face of the earth.",01/10,30-Aug-17,"This movie is a disgrace to the original. Do not watch it, do not support it. Read the manga, watch the anime, dubbed or subbed doesn't matter. Death Note (2017) the concept and story have been completely raped in this movie, no kidding. It is awful. I'm just a simple guy, without director skills or anything, but I know without a doubt, without a single doubt that I and a ton of other people could have done a better job creating this movie. If I had directed this, I would have never released this and if I did I'd be so ashamed I wouldn't even dare leave my house anymore.

sherifeissa,Bad Adaptation of Anime,01/10,29-Aug-17,"I haven't written a review for a movie before, but after seeing this one, this movie doesn't adapt neither from the anime or manga.These aren't the way Yagami Light family is or Mia and how how he meets her or Ryuk.Anyone interested in knowing the truth about Death Note, he should watch the anime or watch the Japanese movies.

ankurkini-450-655463,Out of whack,01/10,19-Oct-17,"OK I don't understand why they would do a remake without understanding the original plot of the anime. Everything from the characters to the plot is plain awful. There is no character development, Kira is NOT a control freak, and L is patient and calm, the characters in this movie are completely opposite of what they were in the anime. Don't waste time watching this, rather re-watch the anime in my opinion. Also, the plot has numerous loopholes and does not add up, i honestly don't know why they had to alter every aspect of the original story. Well, I guess thats what you get when western media tries to remake an eastern epic. 1/10 (1 for trying)

shotas321,Probably the worst adaptation,01/10,16-Feb-18,"Honestly so many crucial mistakes were made in this movie I'm just so annoyed
And probably the biggest mistake was making L black like what? He's clearly white in Manga and Anime so why do you make him Black for no reason in a Movie... pathetic."
lolobal,A great concept not executed right.,03/10,25-Aug-17,This adaptation is poorly adapted and just uses the names of the characters from the death note series just to change them all together. The movie misses the strategy of Kira vs L what everyone loved from the Anime/manga. Light is bland and not as intelligent like in the anime L is alright at the beginning but slowly becomes the stressed cop stereotype.
fredrikht-87914,Awful remake,02/10,28-Aug-20,"They ruined Light. They ruined L. They ruined Misa. It doesn't seem like Netflix has even taken the time to watch the original version. This reminds me of the live-action version of Dragon Ball. Just awful and disrespectful.

bengates-76012,Oh dear,04/10,25-Aug-17,"When I heard they were making this, I was exited. I wanted a good American anime adaptation. I did not get that. The acting is fine but the plot is all over the place. Pacing is awful. The depictions of some characters (L and Misa) are off by a mile. If you a fan of the anime, I do not recommend. If you haven't seen the anime or read the manga, I suggest watching and reading it after seeing this film. It shows what it should've been.

edoardosanguineti,Too Much Rain,03/10,29-Aug-17,"There's too much rain in the movie that it's almost super annoying. In every scene, there's a storm after that sun after that another storm and that's it for the whole film. Fortunately, the rest of the movie is OK. At least they tried to follow the original story. I personally don't like the fact that the protagonist straight up confessed that he was KIRA to a girl he just met."
jakeatobis,Please watch the anime,01/10,12-Apr-20,"I have never seen an interpretation completely miss what made the original work so amazing quite like this. My fiancée and I decided to get drunk and watch this after finishing the anime and it still wasn't enough to make it bearable. Someone clearly read the plot description of the first episode of the anime and thought ""what if I removed all the brains and forced in tons of gore.""All nuance, all character growth, all complication and intrigue, are completely gone. Everything interesting about the show is completely absent here. It is replaced by one-dimensional, uninteresting, and illogical characters with zero motivation, nonsensical plot lines that make no sense on there own, and heaps of totally unnecessary gore.Skip until you've seen the anime, then consider a drunken watch. A true 0/10.

Well it didn't work that way. The movie is simply horrible. It actually made me write my first review just to warn others.

hannahvdoe,Worse Than Avatar the Last Airbender,01/10,25-Aug-17,"It's like the director saw the trailer (not even the first episode), made all the characters white, and decided to make Light an emo ""nice guy genius"" who's just misunderstood. I hate it so much. God everything about this is awful.L eats candy instead of cake, chases Light down the street with a gun, and no one displays the fascinating logic that made everyone love the anime. Also the female lead is basically Kristen Stewart Jr. I cannot say enough how awful this movie is."
immmyh,Don't believe the reviews!!!!,08/10,09-Sep-18,"Ok so my review is based on this just being another movie on Netflix and not as an adaption. Absolutely having now read the original i can see why people might be upset. BUT this does not at all mean this is a bad movie, on the contrary it is a good one that keeps you interested throughout.My advice, watch the movie first than the anime that way you can enjoy both and the differences.The movie is a great watch good acting, good effects and amazing story. This is expected given the story origins.Just sit back and enjoy, you won't regret it.

steeplechase,Advice to all writers and directors who want to add their own take to a franchise,02/10,31-Jan-18,"There is a clear trend with reboots and adaptations where the directors seem to think it's acceptable for them to take something that has a huge fanbase and recreate it, but instead of actually giving it a fresh spin that respects the source material, they create a Frankenstein's Monster - it's not really new, but it isn't really a remake of the old thing either; it's a reboot because they want to build on nostalgia, but they disrespect original characters or the source material in a weirdly twisted way.
This happened to Superman and to Star Wars and to Ghostbusters and to Fantastic Four and to Ghost in the Shell and to The Mummy and to Alien: Covenant and to many other franchises; and of course it also happened to Death Note. Of course occasionally a reboot is a success (like ""It"" and ""Jumanji""), and in some cases the old/new fanbase is rather divided on the issue, as for example The Last Jedi or the Planet of the Apes series have proven.
The overall situation is concerning. Are the creative minds behind these reboots and adaptations not recognizing a pattern? Do they think it's fine to just keep trying over and over until something sticks? Or should they consider a new approach?
Well, my view is this: either stick religiously to the source material, or turn it into something completely fresh that is so new and different that the old fanbase can't possibly feel disrespected. Don't take old characters or names and then give them an unbefitting personality. Why would you do that? Why can't you just create completely new characters, your own characters? Are you people creatively bankrupt or something? Seriously, what is wrong with you?I'm very frustrated with this Death Note adaptation. Other people have explained in great length why they hate it and why it's disrespectful. I'm not going to go into that, I'll just leave the writers and directors of these films with a message: do your own thing, and don't lie to yourselves. Don't pretend that you're able to pay proper respect to the source material of something that's so hugely liked as Death Note. This is not Twilight or 50 Shades, it's not something that only a fringe audience enjoys and most people bash. Death Note is one of the most respected anime series in existence. You can't recreate this, so don't even try. I'm serious.
Do your own thing. If you want to build on the name of Death Note, do something that is so far out there, so completely fresh and new, something that only uses the concept of the Death Note itself and nothing else, so that you don't run the risk of ruining the most beloved characters of the series.
Light, L, Ryuk and even Mia are some of the richest, most complex, most well-written characters in history. You have no idea. Don't pretend that you can reach a level of writing and directing that the fanbase won't rip you a new one for putting them into your own material. Just don't. For our sake and for your own sake."
codycowdell,Amateur film not worth dreading through,03/10,07-Sep-17,"I began watching this movie with decently good expectations and thought it was going to be a suspenseful thriller. The first 30 minutes into the movie met those expectations and Ryuk turned out to be a well developed character. Willem Dafoe was also a good choice to be the voice actor.However, the other actors, screen writers, cinematographers, and almost EVERYTHING else about this film felt cheesy. The story itself was organized poorly and it felt like there were 5 other sub-plots randomly thrown into the film which made the movie look awful. 3/10 is the highest I'll give and that's pushin it

footprints-47143,The Potential of Death Note / Icarus,05/10,09-Aug-21,"I recently finished bingeing the Death Note, and I was intrigued at the prospect of a new movie. LaKeith Stanfield was an odd choice for L, but he nailed the character's bizarre mannerisms. And while Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Ryuk was a slight departure from the source material, he absolutely captured the creepy and menacing atmosphere of a god of death.Unfortunately, that is where the highlights end for this film. To be fair, the cast acted as well as they could with the characters that were written for them. And therein lies the chief problem: writing. In transposing this story for an American audience, Death Note is stripped of the psychological thrills and mind games that made the original so enticing. Instead, we are presented with a pretty generic teen drama with hints of supernatural horror and gore. It is a pale imitation of the anime, barely skimming the surface of its core themes of ethics and justice.There was a great deal of potential, but somewhere in the translation process, some crucial things were lost. In this film, L alludes to Light being a sort of Icarus character, flying too close to the sun. In much the same way, Death Note had high aspirations but ultimately plunged into the black ocean below, swallowed up as a travesty and a tragic waste of a good story."
daniellynch-12164,Good movie.,08/10,29-Dec-20,"Never saw the original series. After reading the other reviews, I'm glad I didn't. I guess it would ruin the movie.

davidkhanks,Don't bother if you like the original manga,01/10,31-Aug-17,"If you like the original manga source material, this movie is going to frustrate you to no end. It's like the writers watched enough of the original to get the main characters names and the basic concept of the notebook and then wrote their own story based on that. It's garbage. None of the characters are anything like the original in almost any way. Even Ryuk's character is betrayed by this adaptation. Which sucks because Willem DaFoe's voice acting was actually pretty good for the character.The high points of the original were the intense mental battles between Light and L in this game of chess played with the pawns of human lives. This movie is barely long enough to build up to a point where L and Light even talk. The original was so cool because of the well-thought out plans and interweaving plot points and this is just a boring linear pile of crap with some gore and teenage hormones. The only people who would watch this movie are fans of the manga and fans of the manga will hate this.TL:DR Don't waste your time"

Jedi2155,Came in with no background but enjoyed it.,08/10,02-Sep-17,"I don't think this movie deserves all the criticism its been bestowed on by fans.

I definitely would recommend it to others.

axis-rose,Entertaining for what it is,07/10,01-Jan-21,"I was never a huge fan of the anime, so my feelings toward this movie aren't heavily swayed by the source material. That being said, I think this movie is still fairly entertaining for what it is. I thought most of the acting and cinematography were good and I remained interested all the way through. I just think there were some issues with tone, as if the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be. Some music choices were a bit odd and Light came off as a bit goofy at points in facial expression and demeanor. It just didn't quite fit with the rest of the vibe of the story.The movie could've definitely benefitted from better pacing and a more solid idea of what it wanted to be. Still fun and worth a watch, though.

arialmartinez,THE AUDACITY,02/10,28-Sep-21,"First of all who THE HELL is Light TURNER??? Ion know him. And why is the whole thing a romance movie? Lowkey kinda offensive to call this an adaptation ngl. I'd at best say it's lightly (Ba-dum-ch sorry) based off the anime. But like... It's REALLY bad either way sooo... Yeah.

maggiesummerxia,Unbearable acting,03/10,28-Jan-21,"I've never seen the source material. I give a low rating because of the bad acting. The actors are basically just reading the lines with a plain voice. I can't tell their intention/emotions from the ways they say the lines. Or maybe it's the script that is so bad even the best actors can't shine.

ttraven,"Horrible adaptation, below average stand-alone.",03/10,01-Sep-17,"Oh boy, here we go! I don't think any of us were expecting this movie to be great, but I was hoping they would handle the original source material with a little bit of integrity. They do not.I'll start out by saying this is a 1.5/10 if you had expectations built from the anime. Almost everything is a downgrade. Instead of being sociopathic and egotistical genius who wants to be god, Light is more of an immature vigilante. Sure, he does kill in the name of justice, but none of his plans have any of the intelligence behind them as you would expect from the anime, and he doesn't have the same aspirations at all. As for L, he throws away all similarities and changes from a cunning and methodical mastermind to an emotionally driven wreck who never seems to be in control of any situation. I'd talk about the other characters, but they don't seem to be important at all in the movie, or have any semblance of character because the movie focuses on an angsty teen ""romance"" for the first half of the movie and gives no time to flesh out anything else. The only redeeming quality is is they got Ryuk right, and Willem Dafoe was the perfect cast choice for him.So how about as a stand-alone movie? After all, this isn't the anime and many people haven't seen the original. Is it good then?!??!Well, it's just... okay. The special effects are decent, the acting isn't as horrible as many reviewers make it out to be, and the scenery and atmosphere of the movie is actually pretty goo. Aside from that, nothing really generates any hype or emotion. The story is less interesting than it should be because the characters are complete idiots. Also, there are Hollywood stereotypes everywhere. High school boy who wants to fight for justice in his own way, teenage drama shoehorned into a story that doesn't need it, drive-by dramatic events without giving any time to become emotionally invested. You know, the usual. What's more is, the little details that they put in the movie from the anime kind of work against it. L's awkwardness and love for sweets, the fact that he is built up as some manufactured super-detective though nothing in the movie would allude to that and is forgotten just as fast as it comes into the movie, Mia Sutton's complete lack of empathy for others... There's just a lot of weird little details carried over that don't fit into this otherwise formulaic movie, and it's jarring when they are compared. It's like this movie didn't know what it wanted to be, so it just put a little bit of everything into it to try and please as many people as possible and to make as much money as possible. Turns out, that ends up pleasing no one, and what we're left with is a rushed and bland mess that only makes people angrier in the end. Another disappointment in the quest of hoping for anime adaptations to finally be good. What a shame.1.5/10 as an adaptation, 4.5/10 as a stand alone film."
Crystalfall,An adaptation sorely lacking the spirit of the original comic,02/10,07-May-23,"Death Note, the manga comic, is rated very highly due to its characters, premise, design and the highly logical way in which the key protagonists go to outwit each other. That is what the source comic is, a game of wits where Light (the Death Note owner) is a brilliant strategic mind and meets his match in the form of the misfit and mysterious L, who is just one step away from catching him purely based on logical reasoning and deduction.While I don't have any issues in adapting the story to an American setting since that is the leeway given to adaptations, this film lacks any of the seriousness and challenge that the comic posed to the readers. While shrinking a 2,300 page comic to 2 hours was going to be impossible, the film lacks any ambition of living up to the original.The main character is mentioned as being bright but beyond doing other students' homework, has no quality of the manipulator and calm thinker that Light Yagami was. While in the comics, he would think several moves ahead, here he is just an American teenager who is more than eager to share his secret so that he can get close to a cheerleader.The only reason this film gets even two stars is due to the effort put in by. Keith Standfield as L, who tries to imbibe L's quirks from the comics, and Willem Dafoe's voice as Ryuk. Rest of the movie is poor to the point of being sacrilegious.Advice: Read the original comic and then perhaps watch this movie to see how a major studio throws away money behind a half baked idea."
jmadeleines,Saw it without expectations,10/10,03-Oct-17,"After watching the rating here on IMDb I decided to see it anyways and boy was I surprised, I really loved this movie. I had no background information about the movie and therefor no expectations. I think you need to see the movie with an open mind and not expect too much. I now know the movie is based on a Japanese anime series that everyone is comparing with the movie but really if you like teenage movies with drama, love and a cool twist to it, then give the movie a chance

moonfire-bogdan,"At first it may seem cheap, but don't be fooled",08/10,10-Oct-17,"I admit, if it wasn't for my sister, I wouldn't have watched it, or at least I wouldn't have watched it till the end. The action starts off quite quickly, giving the idea that it's just a cheap horror movie, only to let the story unfold and hook you in. It really gets interesting when Light Turner meets Mia and shows her the Death Note. From this point, the way the action develops reflecting their relationship really gives this movie some sort of magic that few movies still have. As a whole, it's a bag of mixed emotions, from the weird romance between the two, to thrill and eventually sadness. I was also surprised by the soundtrack, which features names like Trentemoller, Chicago and INXS or popular songs like Take My Breath Away, which I think were well chosen to add to the feeling of the scenes. I was surprised to see it has such a low rating. For me, personally, it was a memorable movie that I'd recommend."

MuaadAlenezi,Worst Production!!!,01/10,28-Sep-17,"I have just watched this film but I'm really so remorseful for watching it. They have lost the luster and essence of the original series, and through their wrong choices, the actors were very bad especially ( Net Wolff ) wasn't the right actor and he couldn't be creative in character performance and you will notice that from the beginning of the detention scene.But to be frank, the actors ( Margaret Qualley & Lakeith Stanfield ) were creative but the director made a mistake because he couldn't show all their skills.In the end, if Netflix turned it into a series with Japanese actors, it will be much better and I think it will be more successful and will far outweigh the series of ""house of cards""I wouldn't like to vote 1 for them nor even ZERO because ZERO has value.

Kyofuski,A disgrace.,01/10,29-Aug-17,"If you like awful acting, disastrous directing and horrific ruining of a legacy of one of the greatest series of all time, this is the movie for you.Death Note, the original anime is one of best written masterpieces of our time, but yet it seems to calve the most horrifying things to spend your time with. You will regret watching this movie. It was distasteful and a disgrace for the art of filmography and the original series.

SynfulBlood,Actually a lot better than I thought it would be.,08/10,27-Aug-17,"...And certainly better than most others make it sound. I've not read one review so far that wasn't based entirely on how it's nothing like the anime, and the ones that didn't mention the anime didn't bother to go into why the movie was bad. It just is, apparently. I don't think so, but I digress. Let's get to the point, shall we?So the movie starts off with the titular Death Note falling out of the sky near Light Turner (Nat Wolff). Ah, getting into the plot right away then, are we? Cool.While in detention, Light decides to examine the notebook, when he meets Ryuk (Willem Dafoe), the death god that dropped it near him in the first place. Now, people use this scene to make fun of the movie, or at least Wolff's portrayal of Light, and I really don't get it. Let me ask you this--If you saw this eight foot tall, demon- looking thing standing right in front of you, how would you react? I guarantee that Light Turner's reaction would be your reaction. Not the indifference that Light Yagami responded with in every other version. Getting back to the point here, Ryuk explains the Death Note to Light--anyone whose name is written in the note will die in the manner specified--and he tests it on a school bully that is harassing another student. Later on, he writes down the name of a criminal that killed his mother, thus beginning his reign as Kira.Now let's go into what works and doesn't work with this movie.Firstly, the cast. For the most part, they're actually really good. I really like Nat Wolff's portrayal of Light. Though he's not my favorite version of the character (that being the one in the other live- action Death Note films), he's still good. Lakeith Stanfield as L, on the other hand... eh. Don't get me wrong, his performance is good enough, but he wasn't L for me. He talks like him and moves somewhat like him, but for the most part, I honestly didn't think I was looking at L for the majority of the film, just someone standing in for him.Next up is Margaret Qualley as Mia Sutton, this movie's version of Misa Amane from the anime, and honestly, this is the best version of the character I've seen. In the anime, she's honestly kind of annoying for me, and in the other adaptations, that was increased a ton. Here, that is not the case at all. The romance between her and Light is actually believable for the most part. I say 'for the most part' because admittedly, it does start rather suddenly, but given the events that happen later in the film, I don't think it's that much of an issue.The writing in the movie is definitely its weakest part. It's not too bad, but the flaws start showing when the investigation bit starts and L comes into play. We never get to see him actually deducing anything, so whenever he figures something out, it seems like a huge leap in logic. He correctly guesses that Kira needs a name and a face in order to kill someone, but how he reaches this conclusion is up for everyone else to figure out. Aside from this, the decision to reduce the focus on the cat and mouse game between Light and L was an odd one for me, but the less time spent with L's lucky guesses, the better, honestly.Overall, this movie is great. While the writing could have been improved on a bit, the movie really surprised me with good performances, interesting characters, and an overall decent story."
VanMarkholme,Review for newcomers,07/10,02-Sep-17,"I have not read, seen, or even glanced at the original story of Death Note. All the reviews on this film are generally angry at the fact that it does not follow the source material. As a movie watcher who is going into a movie with no previous knowledge of the story and has learned information only from the trailer and general ideas of the story, it is a pretty good film. They set up the characters and all we need to know about them and kept a steady theme and rhythm to the movie. The movie should not be labeled a terrible movie because it does not follow the original story. Death Note is an anime series which is hard to bring to the big screen because of the limited time they can tell such a big story. Dragon Ball Z and The Last Air Bender are prime examples of how hard it is to turn a TV show into a movie. It is impossible to fit the complete story in such a short time span. I enjoyed the movie, even though I predicted some twists because I am an avid movie watcher. It may not have followed the source material but it was an enjoyable movie for someone who has no knowledge of the original story.

istanbtsgotblackpinkbigbang,Give it a try.,07/10,25-Aug-17,"Okay I was a fan of the original anime and yes there is mayor differences of the anime and the movie but clearly the butt hurt 12 year old fangirls didn't watch it and are just mad because it isn't exactly the same. At the end in the credits it says based off ""Death Note"" by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata in Shonen Jump. So if you like Death note I do recommend to watch the movie because it was based on the anime it didn't say it was an Adaption. And for the people that say it was poorly acted well it wasn't like they just grabbed random actors and actresses they got people who have been in movies that have gotten good reviews. And yes I am not being bias and am I no where near saying it's the best Death Note movie and that it should win a award or something I am just saying it isn't as bad as people are saying it is.

thepicarloslustre,An empirical review on the prodigy.,02/10,01-Sep-17,"First off, I can see that this movie greatly disparaged the source material (the series Desu Nōto whose manga writers actually put thought into every detail and made it the most intelligent anime adaption to date) and that the only highlight was Ryuk. So, apart from the new age camera angles, let me list three reason about why I think this was created. 1) writer 1: ""Let's make the characters' personalities completely different and make them irrational in every way!"" writer 2: ""Oh yeah because it'll make the original look so much better and thus make it worth watching!"" 2) writer 1: ""Let's implement any and all clichés to highlight the overall improvement of Hollywood adaptions of anime!""writer 2 (has not seen original anime or manga): ""Sounds like a great idea! Can't think of any reason why anybody would have a problem with that! 3) writer 1: ""How about we add drama and clichés and decide not to include several key parts of the death note not only to avoid having to come up with a movie as complex as Desu Nōto (english accent ofc), but to also make this bad enough to be riffed on by Mike Nelson?"" writer 2: ""Hmm I was thinking that would make it kind of unwatchable, but who cares, really? Go for it!""On a different note, this to me is comparable to Manos: the Hands of Fate: the steady pace, the impeccable script, the great acting, the definite plot... the list goes on and on. It feels like the type of title made to be riffed on by the classic Mystery Science Theater Crew. I found myself repeatedly comparing it to the original, but stopped as I had realized it was Final Destination 6.two apples eaten by Ryuk/ten"

The directing is peculiar kind of like a scott-pilgrim style. It wasn't bad for being a remake of an anime which honestly are almost never good.

lganders18,Wasted opportunity,01/10,21-Sep-17,"Speed Racer was loud. Dragonball was annoying. Airbender was boring. Ghost in the Shell was slow. And Death Note is just offensive. Offensive on the part that it doesn't understand what made the source material so powerful and worthwhile. The original story was one of a massive game of chess played with human chessmen. A story of Right and Wrong and the difference between the laws of men and the will of a god. This in name only adaptation is a sad imitation utilizing the aesthetic of Heathers and trying to make an important point about justice while not actually saying anything. Not only do characters barely resemble who they're supposed to represent but they're written so hilariously it's almost an unintentional comedy. Nobody's motivation makes sense, the dialog is about as exposition heavy and plodding as an eighth grader trying to write Macbeth, not helped by a massive overuse of F-bombs and Final Destination style blood and gore. Everything is wrong. The soundtrack is a mishmash of 80s standards that it makes the Japanese movies' use of Dani California look pedestrian, the cinematography is filled with so many dutch angles it might as well be Battlefield Earth. Every actor mumbles they're lines to the point that subtitles are not only an option but a necessity. While Willem Dafoe definitely stands out as the grim reaper Ryuk, every other actor has been tragically miscast. Nat Wolff never manages to encompass the grand chess master persona of Light Yagami. Margaret Qualley portrays a psychopath so unrealistic it makes the original anime look like it has restraint. Lakeith Stanfield almost jumps the line of credibility by being so over the top he shifts tone and focus in every scene, which isn't helped by his hilarious and out of character portrayal of famed detective L Lawliet. But what makes this even sadder is that this could have been the anime movie that worked. The manga and anime had a setting more grounded and realistic than the previous four mentioned. And the ideas of right and wrong, justice by force or by law, and corruption via power are universal constructs and would have made a fantastic story. But all was squandered, and all of this coming from the writers of Immortals and the 2015 Fantastic Four remake. Adam Wingard might have another good movie in him after You're Next, The Guest, and Blair Witch, but this is the final nail in the coffin for movie adaptations of popular anime and anime inspired media."

dxlive,"Not a good film, but not a terrible one.",06/10,28-Aug-17,"Death Note (2017) is not as horrendous as everyone is making it out to be. That said it has incredibly deep flaws... Visually the film is pretty stunning. Lighting is used tremendously, and there are a wide range of shots and transitions to really interest an audience (the weird fish eye shots seem a bit out of place though) The soundtrack is good, and the score makes it feel almost like a musical. But as much as you want to hate on the plot, it wasn't that bad to be honest. Mia and Lights relationship felt incredibly forced, their chemistry was nowhere to be found. The pacing felt strange and a bit rushed at times. The worst it's flaws really being the weird movement away from the actual Death Note manga, or the adapted anime. The casting was at times pretty dumb and their was a clear whitewash which cannot be forgiven, and Light really did not live up to his manga counterpart.But hey, no one expected this film to be the next Schindler's List. It's a fun ride and isn't overly long at 1 hour 40. There's some strange humour that doesn't always hit right (and the end credit BTS is realllly out of place) but it's lightens what some would describe as the 'emo' vibe the director was clearly going for.Don't take this film seriously, it was never really intended to be. But also don't expect this to be Death Note. Maybe next time they shouldn't choose such a well established universe with a dedicated (and at times unforgiving) fan base to try and spin into a Hollywood film...."
daflappman,Tired of Adaptations,04/10,10-Sep-17,"I'll give it credit where it's due: This was... interesting, to say the least. It was interesting as a genuine American localization to watch, especially in the beginning.But as a long-time fan of Death Note, it's beyond time that they stop making adaptations to the source material and simply do their own thing. No more of Light, Misa, Ryuk, Soichiro(not his name in the movie), L and Watari! New characters, new Shinigami, new plot, same Death Note.

faustokotama,Not so bad for those who aren't familiar with the original anime,08/10,09-Mar-19,"I've read a lot of bad and angry reviews of big fans of the anime, but I haven't watched the anime and I didn't think this movie was that bad. I kind of enjoyed it.
So if you haven't watched the anime I think this movie worth a shot.

bberkayaktas-30702,"I'm sorry to say, a failed production",02/10,21-Aug-22,"The music and effects in the original production were excellent, but none of that in the movie. L's being played by a black person made me laugh.The events did not correspond to the original. I gave ''1+1'' stars for the Ryuk's animation."
l-36672,Worse adaptation ever - Prostate exam would be better.,01/10,28-Aug-17,"Sit in a hospital room for a prostate exam, it would be far more exciting.This is a major train wreck of a film. Terrible screen writing, cast was miserably handled, filming was a train wrack, and the director must have been drunk.Story starts and ends as if you were trying to understand the plot of an X film parody with nothing in this film that made it worth watching.Did Netflix just fund a toilet film? Yes, yes they did.Regardless if you know the Anime series, this was handled in the worst way ever. All cast members appeared as if they did their auditions at one of those ""casting couch"" locations. Screen writing was clearly by middle school students. Special effects? none unless you count the cheap costumes used as special effects. Curious George appears to have directed this.In short, this film clearly was short and filmed in about 2 days, and one day for editing/special effects to slap in some blood effects.Netflix, you just got robbed as I am sure you wasted a ton of money for the production of this film."
arturzentai,No,01/10,15-Aug-21,"Quick summary of the movie:

niranjanrathish,I wish I could rate negative,01/10,30-Jun-23,"This death note was supposed to be in like a live action of the original death note , but this was nothing but utter disappointment , the extremity smart , arrogant and secretive light was represented as a weak crybaby , L was shown as a person who even if has good skills jumps into the case right away unlike the real deathnote where he was portrayed as an secretive and very careful and smart . In a way just like the real light in the orginal death note and even Misa who is being portrayed as Mia in this movie , Mia in this movie is just a cheerleader in a highschool manipulating light , Misa from the original movie was the one being used by light in the original death noteoverall this is a disgrace to the original death note as if it was made for the sole purpose to mock death note."
The_Volkman,Mildly entertaining but ultimately disappointing,04/10,28-Aug-17,"I'll try not to make this long winded, because this movie frustrates me more than being covered in mosquito bites on a hot day. The are major spoilers so hide this if you want to stay pure.This movie is ""scene"" culture fan service. It's about teen angst. One edgy teen is given an ultimate power of death, his girlfriend manipulates him, and a young investigator tries to stop him. The costumes are dark and edgy and weird.The movie's conflict is mostly about Light's relationship with his creepy girlfriend whom appears to be obsessed with death, playing on the scene theme. She helps Light choose people to eliminate, but as if that wasn't enough, she must have the power for herself. She tells him she loves him, and then blackmails him into giving her the power by writing Light's name in the Death Note.Then there is the investigator L, a narcissist looking to imprison Light for no reason other than to satisfy his own ego. He acts out constantly and uses some sort of diplomatic immunity to avoid prosecution after causing serious property damage and basically killing 4 people. Talk about deus ex machina.Who cares about relationship problems when you have to power to kill anyone on the planet at will? Why should I care about what happens to the characters? What happened to the composure of Light and L, and their game of chess using law enforcement as pawns? The only sociopath I see here is Light's girlfriend who cared only for the opportunity to kill people.There is simply too much material in the series, even in part 1, to condense it into a movie. If I wanted teen angst I would rather drown in reruns of Pretty Little Liars. Just watch the anime. It is more thrilling and thought provoking than this 'Nickelodeon made-for-TV-movie.'"

aprilzabeth,Entertaining in a Sharknado kind of way,03/10,29-Aug-17,"I've never written a review here before, but I felt I had to after watching this.When it comes to scoring this movie I am torn. As an adaptation I would give this movie a negative one. But without thinking of the anime and scoring it as a movie alone I would give it about a 4.To say this movie is an adaptation is like saying Twilight is an adaptation of Interview with the Vampire. The movie title says ""Death Note"" and some characters have names from the anime, but the similarities end there. Anime is NOT hard to adapt into a movie. The characters, plot, and stories have been written. All you need to do is bring them to life in your own way. You can change the story and still do that if you keep the heart of it alive. But Hollywood likes to write cookie cutter characters in cookie cutter stories.This movie took away every single thing that made the characters and story good and interesting and replaced it with clichéd flat characters with the IQ of a pencil.Death Note is about a mind game. This movie is about a high school romance. There is NO mind game. There is no mind anything. The characters are beyond stupid. The plot relies on everybody being stupid to move the story forward.As a movie itself without thinking of the anime, there are more plot holes than your average movie. We are told the characters are smart while they go around doing dumb things the entire movie. It's like those movies where the hero beats up the bad guy, drops the gun thinking it's over, walks away, and to nobody's surprise the bad guy gets up and grabs the gun.The diolague is the worst I've encountered in any movie ever. I'm not saying this to be mean. It's really that bad. Many times it doesn't even make sense.The movie is not all bad though. The lighting and atmosphere are very nice. The music is nice though often misplaced. Keith Stanfield does a great job being L and sells some really bad lines. Sadly his character goes downhill, but the actor himself does his best to make it good. Keith is the saving grace of this movie. I think it would be an enjoyable movie to watch if you don't want to think about how nothing makes any sense. But if you are expecting good writing and good characters this is not the movie for you. And if you are expecting Death Note to be like Death Note this is REALLY not the movie for you."
lovoga-790-100154,"""A dumb hero's story is certainly shorter, so we'll go with that"" - some executive genius at Netflix",05/10,26-Aug-17,"Adapting Japanese manga/anime stories into an American film can work. In theory, I see absolutely no problem in changing the ethnicity and the location of the characters if the integrity of the story isn't compromised. The problem with DN2017 is the tricks they pulled to fit the story into an approx 1 1/2 hour film. While Light Yagami is known as a hyper-intelligent, cold and calculating teenager always confident to be at least 3 steps ahead of his opponents,which made him extremely charismatic and popular with girls, but also guaranteed the viewers a suspense-filled back-and-forth that was impossible to predict... Light Turner is not that eager to keep secrets (in one scene we see him and his girlfriend running up the stairs in their school literally yelling at each other and everyone else around about exactly the situation they're in) He has nothing in common with Yagami(his popularity situation is that of a Peter Parker, Kickass, or just your next school shooter)That was just one problem I had with the film, but not a minor one."
hesty_mustikadewi,not bad,05/10,02-Sep-17,"Well,i think the biggest different between death note Japanese version and this death note is on the KIRA's character,in death note origin(japan) kira is genius sociopath,he doesn't care to kill his girlfriend,father,FBI agent(which is innocent people) only to cover his track and he's really into KIRA is everything, and has no emotion.But in this movie,we can see kira in more human form,i think he just do all the killing to impress Mia,and its fun to see bad guy die.And there are several moment he shows that he remorse and know what he did is wrong and don't forget that Mia is the one who kill all the FBI agents.I think Mia is more suitable to become kira than light.But the last 5 minutes is the only interesting part of this movie.I wonder whether his father will become his accomplished after light tell him all.I think see this ""different version"" of KIRA is really refreshing. And for L character,i just know that he can panic and cry (*sorry for my bad grammar*)"
williamandrewsthefirst,"Okay, but not wonderful",04/10,19-Oct-17,"What I was most surprised to see in this film was a casting of an Eliot Lipp Doppelgaenger. It was bizarre. For the first 15 minutes of the film I was sure the protagonist was either him or an unspoken of brother. But, I digress...the film would be fantastic if the anime didn't exist. The anime, both drawn and animated, had a much more interesting villain and antagonist. The falling of the Seattle great wheel was terribly unrealistic and unnecessary to include. I didn't find that part enjoyable, and felt myself turning away from the screen from nausea.

cookfamily-08989,Great if you watch it and not the anime,09/10,09-Sep-17,"Hopefully this helps the people out there looking for an awesome movie that don't watch anime. As a standalone movie, it's absolutely fantastic. The guy that plays ""L"" was a fresh and interesting character, with an outstanding performance. I've never seen the cartoon so I don't know how it compares, but I hope some of you that also haven't seen the cartoon will give this title a chance because it's suspenseful, dramatic, thrilling, and clever.Also, as always, Willem Dafoe was awesome.

vacya,worst adaptation of anime,03/10,19-Jan-22,"Fans of the anime 'Death Note' this film is contraindicated. You will not see anything in it, except for the likeness of Ryuk and a couple of matching names. And the intentions were the best! Everything seems to be about a notebook, about death, and about how bad it is to dispose of people's lives. And the story is set out more compactly, in just an hour forty. But in the Western presentation there is nothing left of the magnificent oriental detective story, of the amazing psychologism and the confrontation of the greatest minds - the super-detective-L and the super-killer-Kira. There are no complex characters here, and intricacies with intrigues. NOTHING! The kid found a notebook, began to understand the rules, but there were too many of them, unlike the Japanese instructions, thanks, the god of death Ryuk came and suggested something ... And the kid began to punish criminals right and left. Only nothing has changed in him, neither thoughts, nor internal transformations - no matter how hard they try to convince us that he has become a villain."
andreythorne,Great Movie :-),10/10,27-Sep-17,"Great movie. Interesting story line. A bit different from usual movies they show nowadays. Had a good ending. But, still has some unanswered questions. Hope to see another one. Reminds me a little bit of an Odd Thomas (2013) movie. I think that one day I would watch this movie again.

AlucardTheSpy,Death of the Note,01/10,22-Jul-20,"This movie is a confused mess to say the least. As a fan of the anime, manga, and the Japanese live action movies, when I heard this was coming out I was curious. When I heard it was going to be about ""What would happen if the Death Note fell in America"", I was thrilled. I thought it would be an entirely new story. It would have been interesting to see another holder of the Note, and their own unique tale on what is and isn't justice.
It borrows the names of characters from the original story and gives them some traits, but these aren't them. None of the characters are how they were in the anime or manga, which would be fine if these were completely new characters, but they aren't they use americanized versions of them except for some cases. Light Yagami to Light Turner, Misa Amane to Mia Sutton, and L and Watari keep their names the same.
Now, while they share the names and one or two traits they are overall not themselves, so certainly we could've gotten a unique story right? Again, no. I won't give away the story, but for the most part it tries to rip off scenes from the anime/manga which comes off as rushed and undeserved.
This movie wants to be its own thing, yet feels like it needs to reference the original. The detective didn't need to be L. The main character didn't need to be Light. They could've had an entirely new story from the ground up, but instead they just butchered a perfectly good one. Don't even give this 6 minutes and 40 seconds of your time, it is not a Death worth seeing."
aliwinder-77859,"Nothing like the Manga/Anime, very disappointed!",01/10,25-Aug-17,"As much as I like Ryuk in this film. This Movie was not well made at all... Nothing like the Manga, if you're going to make a movie based off of a book do it the right way... Please..! Light had a different last name and it had no connections to the Manga/Anime. In the books Light is a very smart and nice kids that steps upon the Death Note and no one would ever guess he was Kira, that is what's so great about the books. He isn't discovered until finally he makes one mistake and it ends everything. In the movie it was completely the opposite, Light is a complete douche who, at first, kills all the people who ""deserve"" to be killed, but after that he tells his girlfriend everything which is what ruined the entire movie. She was obsessed with the book and wanted it for herself. That is completely stupid. Light is supposed to be very smart and bright kid but he tells his girl which is the dumbest thing you could do. Again, the only good part about this movie was Ryuk. He was very creepy and didn't take sides. That's what I liked about him, he knew that Light would mess up eventually and then he could get him out of the picture. Another thing, L is awful in this movie! He is supposed to be this awkward guy who figures out Light is Kira but ends up becoming close to Light and denying the fact that he is Kira. Eventually being killed off in the Manga/Anime. In the movie he is just a rage freak who just wants to kill Light the whole movie. That is ridiculous and completely stupid. I highly do NOT recommend watching this movie. It is disappointing and ends being very boring half way through the movie. If i could give it 0 stars I would, I hope someone will eventually remake this the right way."

sarapogue,Give this movie a chance,08/10,30-Aug-17,"I had to jump in here because there are a lot of negative reviews. I get that Death Note has quite the fan base. I've not seen the original show but I have read the manga. I felt that the movie was true to that material. It was a little less over the top than the storyline in the manga but there was no glaring alteration of the source material. If you have no previous experience with the Death Note story - there is a good chance you will like it. I watched it with my family - some who had previously seen the show or read the books and those who had not. Everyone enjoyed it. I like that the story was wrapped up enough that you weren't disappointed but has enough opening that they could easily make more Death Note movies. For what it is, this is a good movie. It was well constructed and should be given the chance to shine.

firefistakka,Horrible,01/10,27-Dec-20,"Its so bad it makes me wanna cry and scream everytime I think about how this exists for people to watch.
The best scene in the movie is when he screams when he meets Ryuk, because it was like a glimpse of hope that this, in fact, was a joke, unfortunately it wasn't.

evelinasisb,Dude... What the Frick!?,01/10,25-Jan-21,"I'm not gonna say a lot of things about this ""movie"". As a big fan of the manga, the movie was literally a garbage! In my opinion, they should have given the whole production to the Japanese, because they have proofed that they can make a better TV series by a manga. If you wanna watch a pretty good "" Real Life Manga "" then you should check Alice in Borderland.

Good plot and also good acting.Dont listen to any of the anime reviews, I've seen people giving it 1 star just because ""the book"" from the movie didn't had lines while the book in the anime edit actually did have lines...Again, must watch if you like a good story!!

johnnyholman,Unbiased opinion,07/10,25-Aug-17,"First, I've never seen the original anime to this, so I cannot compare it. Its been my experience that anime's are always better than their live action counterparts. That being said, I enjoyed this movie, but for 3 reasons, Willem Dafoe as the voice of Ryuk (Just an awesome choice) and instead of using cgi, they went with a costume which made it more enjoyable. Watching movies with cgi makes most movies less interesting, I prefer old school sets and creativity. Lastly, the blood and gore, I love a good splattering of blood or decapitation scene in any dark film. Had a ""Final Destination"" feel to it. Even though the story was a bit weak, even a little lame it still interested me enough to the point that I would like to check out the anime. So I give it a 7/10.

renataszaboaus,America had to ruin this one too...,01/10,05-Sep-23,"I know this is not an actual adaptation of the original Death Note, but man what is this???! When it was revealed almost straight away that Light's dad is cop I was like nah i'm out. Death Note is about so much more than some trashy American teen horror movie. Having read the manga and watched the anime series I guess I would be biased but this movie is just straight up unwatchable and I didn't even bother to watch till the end. The story line is exactly the same as any other horror movies America has produced in the last 15 years (well, most of them). What a disgrace to use such masterpiece as an inspiration and ruin it like this."

brightsidereviews,A fantastically put-together dark comedy.,09/10,13-Aug-18,"I did not watch this movie with any pre-conceived notions of what Death Note has to be. I saw a clip with Willem Defoe as Ryuk and was sold. Having just rewatched the movie, I enjoyed it even more. The performances are great, it's filled to the brim with interesting and cool shots and great background details, the OST is full of 80s synthy goodness, and the whole movie is so much fun. Lakeith Stanfield gives the best performance of the movie, which made me pay attention to him before he showed up in Get Out and Atlanta, but Nat Wolff, much reviled I've seen for his portrayal of Light, is equally if not more deserving of praise for his hilarious line deliveries and for throwing himself full-force into this role. This role which isn't the same Light as in the manga or anime, but is the right character for this movie. This is a funny movie, and doesn't take itself too seriously, but is also very professionally and carefully put together on a technical level. Particularly at the beginning it struck me as being quite similar to Donnie Darko, but becomes its own twisted self as it goes on. I have heard the complaints, the angry fans, but as a movie, not as a Death Note adaptation but purely as its own film, I can find very little wrong with it, and countless reasons to enjoy it."
rodel_onez2011,They ruined it.,01/10,02-Apr-20,"The main character, Light, is suppose to be an asian kid from Japan but of course Hollywood casted a white boy. They shouldn't have made this movie.

michellerushford102,I have so many questions!!!!,05/10,26-Oct-17,"Not entirely horrible but I have questions that we're left unanswered. Why did Light kill Mia? What did L write on that piece of paper that was hidden in Mia's calculus book? How did Mia get ownership of the death note? How did his dad find out? I mean yeah Light has that newspaper clipping, but would that really be solid evidence to prove that Light did it? What happened to Light at the end of the movie? Did he die? Did he go to jail? Does his dad believe him? Or think he's a psychopath? I would very much like some answers!!"
spdss-spdss,Very bad,01/10,07-Sep-17,"There is a very poorly constructed film that in no way follows the original story of the anime. I recommend watch the anime and forget this movie. Watch this movie is waste time of your life in a movie that does not enrich your film culture at all. There is so many films that are better than this. OK it has good plans and median images, but believe in me it's wasting time watch this movie.

aarontaylor88,Disappointment,01/10,08-Nov-22,"I'm absolutely gutted. I love the death note anime and I wanted to give this a chance. I really wanted to like it. Now I realise this wasn't going to be a like for like adaptation. And I get that you're not going to be able to fit all elements and story threads into 1 hour 40 mins. But at least get the characters right and at least ensure that the plot makes sense for those new to death note. Another Americanified anime film that just doesn't work. Much like the shockingly bad Dragonball evolution film. This film only earns its one star for Willem Dafoe as Ryuk, who was awesome. If you like Death Note, don't watch this.

ajssteelers,Massive disappointment to what could have been a massive success,02/10,27-Aug-17,"If you watched the original anime, then you have an idea on how you want these characters portraits. The different spin on what many call a classic.the portrayal of every character is so far different that this movie is unenjoyable to watch. The different rules the death note has makes for some unwanted changes in the story. Massive plot holes due to the completely rushed story line. L was the biggest disappointment for me.L is a man of few words, shows little to no emotion, is completely strategic in every move he makes. But in this version it appears we have a completely autistic L that causes this character to act irrational, loud, overly emotional and ends up using the death note, completely taking away the core values I loved of L. LIGHT, the son of a cop that runs the opperation. LIGHT was strategic, super smart, and was able to move 3 steps ahead of the cooperation, making few hiccups along the way. In this movie light was made out to be an arrogant child that was easily picked out as the nutorious Kira. I was incredibly disappointed in this version of what I feel is my favorite series. I hope to see a live action death note to at least hold the core values and can hold the massive detective story that the anime held sooner than later, but this was not it."
gunsnroses8052,I think the director never watch any episode it the original Death Note,01/10,16-Oct-20,"What makes the film so bad not the change in plot but that make it horrible the change in the character essence.
Kira or light just a typical teen with no brain what so ever follow his heart not his brain rush to his crush to show her the death note . So he is the opposite of the original Light .
Don't make me start with L .
Show his cover immediately to any one .
Try an ethical method to capture Kira.
And most Obnoxious thing in the character of L is make him hateful and angry not calm at all ."
georgemclanejr,Either a total cringe-fest or brilliant satire,01/10,04-Sep-17,"I usually wouldn't say something like this, but this might be the worst film I've ever seen. Absurd Lifetime movies were less cringe inducing. The Americanization is reminiscent of the 1990s, with tacky changes like ""Light Turner"" and changing Misa to Mia. Mia is a horrendous character who is little more than an object made to titillate the male audience. The fact she became the villain, as well as the fact that L acted like a cartoon character and kicked some homeless guy for no reason makes this film feel like a misogynistic fan fiction written by some Light fan girl. L was a horrendous character, and while the Kira thing was incredibly easy to figure out, he figures it out in the most ridiculous way. He assumes that a CRAZY man who took his family hostage killing himself was manipulated. While this was the case, saluting before killing yourself doesn't seem that out of place, especially since the people in this world are just the most. Light's new characterization would be good if he was still written as a villain, since a lot of people who saw the original somehow managed to not understand that. The movie wouldn't even be enjoyable to a person who doesn't think when they watch a movie, since many scenes are pure cringe. The ridiculous death scenes near the beginning were awful, but the icing on the cake is when the leads are falling off the Ferris Wheel while making goofy faces to unfitting 80s synth pop music. The thing I find most infuriating about his movie is that it's basically a poor remake of Heathers with the roles reversed, and the Death Note stuff just shoehorned in there. Why not just make an edgy movie about violent, horny teens manipulating each other and leave a beloved property alone. The only goodish thing about this movie is that I kinda got the vibe it was a parody at some point, but that just feels like my good side wants to believe that humanity isn't capable of creating such a god awful piece of art."
mr-skinz,If you've never read or seen the original source then it's OK,06/10,01-Sep-17,"That's the issue with it, alone it's not that bad, it's a popcorn flick teen movie with some gore.Up against the source material it falls very very short, and that's not even a casting thing (personally i thought the guy that played L nailed the character perfectly, regardless of his skin color...which is stupid thing to get bent out of shape for anyway *breathes*).Where i feel it falls short is the justification for Light's actions, they try and shift the blame to Ryuk and Mia. They've basically dumbed Light down a hell of a lot to make him ""relatable"", he's meant to be on par with L which is one the key things that makes the anime/manga so good. There's a real intense battle of wits.Overall the movie feels a little rushed as well, i understand there is a lot of fit into one movie... and the blindingly obvious sequel that will follow... but come on netflix... you could of taken a bit more time to polish it up... or even go for a series would of been a better way to approach this i feel.If you want a good live action version the Jap ones are actually pretty good and an interesting twist on the original story. If you want the full effect, go watch the anime or read the manga.Again, it's not terrible, but feels like a wasted opportunity."
itsapplehd,Not bad,07/10,26-Aug-17,I liked the movie because I knew what to expect. I knew people would give it bad reviews because they watched the anime and it was different. I knew it was going to be different because An American film differs from a Japanese anime. They had to put a lot of seasons of anime into just one movie and I think it was OK. I enjoyed it.
iriskaper,Movie Experience,06/10,29-Aug-17,"This is the first time I write a review. I did it because this is a fairly new movie. I hope this will help the new watcher, for the expectations for this film. In my opinion, this is a movie with a too fast timeline, no construction, bad actors and unbelievableness. I thought that this should be a great movie, looking at the trailer. Unfortunately, this was not. I'm sorry, but I will never see this movie again.

itachisusanoo,Watch the behind-the-scenes trailer of death note on netflix!!,07/10,25-Aug-17,"If you don't understand the context of this movie you are probably going to be disappointed y the movie. And the context is EASY, it's literally a 2 minute behind-the-scenes trailer that's on netflix and is easily accessible from the movie itself. This movie is the vision of producer or something of the like, called Adam Wingard or something! And his vision is to place greater emphasis on the fact that it is a teenager rather than a mature adult who uses the ability of the death note. This didn't come from nowhere, as Light in the anime wasn't THAT far from a child either in his justification of his killings, as L himself points out (though the manga version of Light is wiser). Also, in the end you'll notice Light does do something somewhat advanced. You'll also notice the intelligence of Light in the anime is reduced a bit and then split in two between Light and Mia in the movie. If you want a proper live-action adaptation of the anime, watch the two or four Japanese live action movies, or the Japanese live action dramas, they are both worth watching. This here is supposed to be something else, and I think it did its job pretty well for a single movie. Considering how much that could've gone wrong (db evolution and avatar tla), this movie ended up well. The movie kept me interested throughout (except for a few killing sprees) and ended on a strong note (could L have written his own name?). This is a decent standalone movie that might serve to introduce live-action biased viewers to the world of anime!"
mijokuki,Lame,02/10,03-Feb-21,"I understand this movie isn't a cover of the original manga. I realize it's a new take on an amazing story. But casting, acting and the story is terrible. Dafoe made this 1 star rating a 2 star rating.

ovidiumoldovanu,I don't know what is wrong with the world,10/10,22-Sep-17,"I honestly don't know what people expected. When a director makes a new movie, especially a reinterpretation o an existing movie, I can assure that they don't want it to be the exact copy of the last one, but with better image quality. They want to leave a mark on the story, they want it to be different. I've seen such bad reviews and so much hate regarding this movie and Nat Wolff's character and I can honestly say that I can't understand why. I liked his acting in this movie and many more. I actually enjoyed the movie, with only two exceptions. In the first 30 minutes they are kind of fast-forwarding, and I did't quite like it but I can't say that I hated it. I prepared me for the next hour. And the second thing, I did't really like how it left me hanging in the end, but other than that I liked the movie. It certainly doesn't deserve a 10, but it certainly isn't a 1-star movie.

chox_64,Worst movie I've ever seen,01/10,28-Aug-17,"I started reading death note while it was in Shonen Jump and I've always have a special place in my heart for it. Death note is such an important manga/anime to me. I've always loved the creativity throughout the manga and anime. I really wanted to like this movie but I'm sorry it was just all kinds of wrong. The only parts that were even remotely similar was the death note itself and the names of most of the characters. Beyond that not one thing was remotely similar to the manga and anime I grew up with and loved. I feel as though the director didn't even bother trying to understand the anime, or even care to make a move that honored it. Watching this felt like the director was destroying something from my childhood that I loved and held dear. It wasn't stylish, and it wasn't well done! I dislike the idea that in order to make a movie from another culture we have to totally erase that culture. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. It not only wasn't faithful to the source it was just down right awful in general! Even if I wasn't a fan of death note the acting was terrible, the script was terrible, and the effects were bad. There were so many parts that just made NO sense what so ever! They just jumped around and there were one too many plot holes."
bysectual,I cried inside at how horrible this movie is,02/10,29-Aug-17,"I don't understand how Hollywood continues to take something perfect and create garbage. I mean seriously if I give you a recipe for a good meal, you don't have to spice it up with extra ingredients. I mean if you wanted to make your own meal don't ask me for my recipe. You can't take a recipe for velvet cake and make cheese cake and still call it velvet cake.I'm upset with the writers, producers, and everyone involved who saw the original, then looked at this script and thought it was a good idea. Does anyone care about the fans? Hollywood has a history of this crap.Your artistic reinterpretation skills are garbage. If you had any kind of artistic creativity you wouldn't need to do a remake. IF you want to flex your creativity skills go make a movie that is original. When you take the time to remake someone elses great works, do them the honor and stick to the freaking script."
jerryguyette,It is actually pretty good.,08/10,26-Aug-17,"This Death Note face value is good I liked it for what it is sure it didn't have everything the the anime had but I still got enjoyment from it. So judging it by the anime is unfair it's a film adaptation. Let's not forget or manga readers out there who hate the anime for messing up the character or story. So just sit back and enjoy a cliff note telling off Death Note & if you are new to it watch it. It may make you jump into the anime itself & then you will be in for a treat and a bunch of Apple's.

joel-90969,not the anime but a decent movie in itself.,07/10,27-Aug-17,"I understand the hate that this movie is getting and I somewhat agree with it. But I gave it a chance and I kinda liked it. I really like the anime and the concept. The movie is not a good live action adaption, but it is a good movie if you count it by itself. If you haven't seen it yet, give it a chance, If you ask me, and mostly everybody else, I say that the anime is so much better. But I did enjoyed this movie and some people might too.

gingerbeardmanftw,Disappointing and disrespectful to the original.,02/10,29-Aug-17,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! ------------------------------------------ If there is anything i have in common with a lot of people, it is my love for Anime and cartoons. I always enjoy watching the endless hours of beautifully animated scenes, clever comebacks and slapstick humour put into episodes of max 15 minutes a pop. So when I heard that ""Death Note"", one of the best anime's and manga's ever made, was being made into a Real Life film for the 4th time, and in OUR time and in English, i had to think to myself: ""That sounds pretty darn interesting. I will give it a go when it comes out!"" Now, i am not a big fan of self harm... But if i had a time-machine available, i would go back into time and punch the ever-loving dust out of myself for even thinking that this was a good idea. Here is why: 1. The Plot. The film is supposed to be a side setting from the original series, set in America and not in Japan. Now, that is all swell, i have no problem with that. The only problem i have with the plot of it is... IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE SERIES! And this is connected to... 2. THE CHARACTERS! >:@ -The main characters name: Light Turner. Light. LIGHT!!! THE main protagonist in the anime, and the most outstanding villain to boot, is now being portrayed by this American, low key, hypocritical, whiny, wimpy (bleep) useless kid that doesn't know the first thing about being a ""saviour of the people!"" With this first thing in mind, i personally feel repulsed, nauseated, offended, slapped and betrayed by this very notion. I mean, his FATHER is a police officer, for crying out loud! Moving on. -Misa's character has been replaced by the BLANDEST OF BLAND since Kristen Steward's rendition of Bella Swan. Mia Sutton is from the very start Lights love-interest. It is as obvious as the fact that your eyes will catch fire if you watch the sun for too long, and after watching this monstrosity of a movie, looking directly at the sun would have been a better idea. They get involved after Light tries to break up a fight in front of her, and then later gets one of the bullies involved killed by being decapitated by a ladder. So i will give props for the killings, even though it seems entirely ripped off of almost every Final Destination film that ever existed. Light blindly trusts the info of the Death Note to her immediately after getting to talk to her, and therefore probably set himself up for complete and utter failure in the near future. And now, for the GRAND FINALE, because i frankly couldn't watch the whole film. I watched 37 minutes of it, and then i felt like my soul was dying from this horrendous exposure of dirt: L/Ryuga/Lawliet My favorite character of all time, never ever surpassed by anyone from any other anime. The one that i absolutely adored and enjoyed from the moment he was introduced till his inevitable (Yet shocking) demise. To his return in this film, i have but one thing to take up, that i believe some people may be offended by, but frankly: I could not give less of a sh**: WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH FILM-MAKERS OBSESSION WITH MAKING REMAKE CHARACTERS, WHO WERE ORIGINALLY THE WHITEST OF WHITE, BLACK?!! I mean, SURE: a BLACK L seems to be an interesting turn, but also VERY UNORIGINAL! Has the world ended up being THAT self- important that film-makers need to prove themselves to not be racist by casting a black person to do a previously white role??! It seems a bit childish, and a bit racist in itself. Like: Why not, then, make ALL the casting black? Or at least a majority?? But no: The black person has to be the eccentric and the mysterious character. And for the record: He didn't even do that good of a job at being L in the first place! Oh yeah, and did i mention that the ""Kira"" identity that Light made in the anime RETURNS?!! THAT in itself was too much for me, and the moment i got to know this, i stopped watching the film, because i just couldn't continue. -------------------------------------------------------------------So in conclusion: Netflix... Why do you hate us? I can see why they approached this project. They wanted to freshen it up, they wished to make it unique and to introduce the public to this series with a newfound idea that hopefully would make the film appeal to a larger crowd... But you butchered it for those of us who already loved the series. You killed it, you trampled it into the dirt and you spat in its face afterwards. SO! These are the steps to follow in getting this film: 1. Get the film on a pirated disc. 2. Download the original anime. 3. Burn it onto the pirated disc, therefore wiping the film. 4. Sit back and enjoy. Or alternatively: Just go watch the series itself.Or read the manga, if you prefer that."
karakui,Basically not Death Note,02/10,29-Aug-17,"The Good: 1. Despite the ridiculous deaths, the CGI of the Ferris wheel looks nice.2. It generally does a good job setting the atmosphere using environment. It felt like this went to waste. 3. Mi(s)a having more of a personality was nice, even if it was still kinda bad.The Bad: 1. The protagonist is laughable. Unlike the original Light, he doesn't come across as a highly intelligent and idealistic young adult, he comes across as pretty average, at best. 2. Both L and Light rely far too much on emotion. The exciting parry of mental blades is completely lost, and it just plays out like a couple of children repeating ""Yes you did!"" ""No I didn't!"". 3. The editing of the book's rules to fit the writer's 'plot twists' is incredibly frustrating. Light never really had to solve any problems, he could just invoke a new rule to do it for him. 4. The deaths massively detracted from the experience. The sheer quantity of drama stuffed into them (one person literally exploded, and another was decapitated by the blunt step part of a ladder) turned it into a terrible attempt at comedy, and completely ruined any attempt one could make to take the film seriously. 5. The fact that Light survives every encounter using sheer luck is in huge contrast to the original work. It is more of an exercise in ""what would happen if an immature child was given the power to murder people?"" than a genuine piece of entertainment."
pprabhat7,old is gold,03/10,29-Aug-17,"I understand that they tried to change death note by changing the story but they completely failed at it horribly.they tried to change the story line but didn't change the other basic things like L style, limo, either they should had changed it completely or kept it unchanged they failed to understand the basic core of death note what made it so popular among its viewer it was not the concept of death note but battle of wits b/w Kira and L.they showed light as a monkey who has a gun & not know what to do, as a child with a god complex(well it was one of the core)but scary cat but in the original story he was on completely different level.L as a man who didn't have P of patience which was of original L's character strength.it was not L but more of 7 a complete opposite and twisted LWell I appreciate their effort for change in death note .a good thing is spoiler aren't going to spoil the movie the netflix has taken care of it. they should take their own advice ""don't fly too close to the sun""story-2 acting - they should watch death note seriesmusic-......f"
danny_silk,Worthwhile effort but - stick with the original,05/10,28-Aug-17,"I guess as with all previously made Asian Horror flicks Hollywood has to go down the remake trail, but history shows us that there is little success in trying to mimic what has been previously done so well outside of the USA, this is no exception.It is worth a watch and it does provide a good mixture of twists and was made on a good budget. I have given this a 5 and I do not regret watching it, it does however prove to me how good this genre is outside of Hollywood, 'Rings' is another example, some things may be better off left alone.

dersan-33680,Adam Wingard is a liar,05/10,25-Aug-17,"first of all i'm just gonna say it, the start until the L scene where he just publicly starts a war at Kira/Light. i thought it was getting a pretty good start after that scene the movie felt to rushed, maybe if it was a TV series i think it will do good, but it's a 1 hour and 40 minutes movie and they suddenly splash a lot of info without letting us catch a breath. I remember Adam Wingard saying his staying true to the manga. I quite understand the difference between this Light and the manga version. In this version Light is an edgy, cringe American kid and that's a bit understandable since the movie itself started in 2017 instead of 2010 where back then i think not many stupid happens as it is now.Keith Stanfield as L, when i first i saw him as L i thought he did a decent job, until he publicly call himself out and risking Watari (and by the way in the anime/manga is his real name) like L should be smarter than this he knows that he can control people's death yet he let is slide, after he got caught he basically become a maniac, it's his fault you let Watari got controlled. Mia i thought she was the one who is a bit true to the anime/manga a psychopath and crazily in love with Light.about the Death note in this movie it got Upgraded. the death note basically can now brainwash your victim's and made him into a slave and do whatever the Notebook holder commands like telling him on what should he do and stuff and what worst is how they put Chicago's ""I don't want to live without your Love"" song in the worst timing yet where Mia dies it made me laugh when that scene happened and they didit again during the final scene, it's so unsatisfying. the ending is a f***ing cliffhanger like y tho, the ending scene is a disappointment it's a f***ing cliffhanger. Thank god i've finished it never watching it again"
shadab_ali_420,The Death Note Version of Dragon Ball Evolusion,01/10,31-Aug-17,"Aww..the raping of original manga returns. So much so that when you watch it you would cringe away and wish that this was directed by someone else. The actors were not just bad, it was the worst piece of acting i have ever seen. In one plot where the Shinigami first appears,Nat Wolff (Light)started screaming in a way it almost felt like i was watching a ""Scary Movie"" type parody. In the original Light was tall,skinny and DARK character not puffed nosed clown. L wasn't black either. Horrible casting, terrible acting and very poorly directed. It was rushed and should have been a series with a fit director and cast to fully bring in the suspense and psychological drama not butchering it by converting it to American teen drama."
efc-21168,Complete insult to Death Note,01/10,30-Aug-17,"Should never have been made. Unable to understand how a film of this quality is given the OK to be released. Should not have called the film Death Note as it is about 10% similar to the original. Light is very poorly played by the actor, in the original everything about who he is and his personality is almost insulted by this movie. Also everything about Mia (Misa in original) is totally incorrect, how anyone can enjoy this film baffles me, wouldn't recommend it to anyone who enjoys the the manga and anime.

gizaflame,IT IS A FKING JOKE.,01/10,28-May-20,"Don't even bother with this one. It is damn joke and an ultimate insult to the original Anime. Acting was bloody cringe and the screwed up story totally killed the essence why Death Note was so popular which was L and Light making calm and smart decisions.This look like a film made from middle school film students as their school project.

johansensoulstorm,The end of death note.,01/10,31-Aug-17,"Whoever did the CASTING CHOICE should NEVER be allowed to do any again. This is an anime to live adaptation movie and it feels whoever did the casting NEVER saw a single picture of the anime characters, seriously 0 effort.Want a tip? Look for Zac Efron for Yagami Light on google he would be perfect, he's not available? don't do the movie. Not even going to waste my time talking about L.Clearly whoever did this was either mocking/insulting or simply calling retarded to the entire death note anime fan base.

anderpsmail,Read the manga or watch the anime instead.,01/10,01-Sep-17,"First I will compare this movie to the source material. I won't spoil anything, manga included (I highly recommend reading it BTW). I won't rant about the failure of the casting crew to cast an Asian. The characters are no where near as complex or fascinating as they are in the manga. If anything it looks like the movie writers dumb them all down to fit American stereotypes. Ryuk is the only good one among the characters, he is almost as interesting as the manga's Ryuk. I feel like this wouldn't have been so bad, if they made the decision to make this movie take place after the manga instead of trying to make a dumb down Americanized retelling of it.

tadozong,Worst,01/10,01-Sep-17,"One out of ten is even too much. Watching this after watching Light Up The New World is like watching Barney after Jurassic Park Trilogy. Worst casting, they definitely destroy every character. Muddy story lines too. It was stupid how they make Ryuk be responsible of all things. Plus the whole goddamn relationship thing between Light and Misa."
lethe-14277,Get over the whitewashing thing.,04/10,27-Aug-17,"This movie is below average. Its bad. It hurts my feelings. Having watched death note at 10 years old and finding a deep love for both L and Light and their meticulous planning of every possible outcome, this movie did a disservice to the characters. Light was smart, academically in the movie, but he was well rounded in the anime. His character never would've used the Death Note to impress a girl. Mia is the definition of manic pixie dream girl if I ever saw one, only worse. They completely slaughtered L's character and made him an irrational, sugar high, sleep deprived know-it-all. He came to conclusions that were never explained. The white washing? Get over it. There already is a Japanese version of death note, so I was excited to see what kind of changes they made by Americanizing the story. All of the changes were unnecessary and almost embarrassing to watch. Although to be frank, I didn't really think the acting was that bad. The script is what ruined it. L runs after Light with a gun? What? Mia tries to kill Lights dad? WHAT? Not to mentioned they killed his mom and neglected his sister's existence, sure his mom wasn't really an important character in the story; so if they wanted Light to be more lovable, killing off his mom would be a great way to do it. However, his sister is a hostage at some point in the anime. Its like they took paper downs and smeared ryuk's leathery ass all over it so they could call it Death Note."
kokosok,Garbage,01/10,01-Sep-17,"This is insult to real death note. How can you put L to be nibbler? You really denied good actors because they were not Americans and made this ? This is shame and nothing else. Shame. Shame. Shame. During this whole film i was cringing and feeling bad, story is dumb and acting is even worse. Girl likes him because he is killer, are you for ******* real?

oroy-03358,I created an account just to write this review...,02/10,01-Sep-17,"I've never written a review before, but Death Note (2017) deserves it. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because I found it visually appealing (albeit quite boring). I watched the anime series last year and LOVED IT. I finished it in less than a week. The whole integrity of the show was based on the fact that Light was a smart and likable person in his life at school/home, and therefore no one suspected him of being Kira. THEN WHY THE HECK is Light in this version such a loser. He is antisocial and unlikable. He is drawn to Mia as the popular girl in school, where in the original we know that Light was only using Misa. Ryuk gives Light all the rules of the book, where really the fun came from Light having to figure out the rules himself. It's just so many contradictions. I get that they can't do a scene-by-scene remake of the original, but at least keep the characterization. I understand that they were trying to do a recreation of a classic, but they took the idea of the Death Note and just completely bastardized it. It's some kind of weird teenage rom/com with an element of fantasy in it. This is not what Death Note is supposed to be about. An utter disgrace, if you're interested in the idea go watch the originals."
jhackett9,"Acceptable movie which, fortunately, does not try to emulate the source material",06/10,25-Aug-17,"First of all, every person giving this movie a 1 or 2 out of 10 because it strays from the source material should not be allowed to review movies. If you can explain how a 37 episode anime can be condensed to 120 minutes, I'm all ears. Movie reviewers need to remove their personal bias from a review, so that someone unfamiliar with the source material can still understand the review.Additionally, besides the plot, and some character design, the main theme of the story stays intact. The WHOLE PURPOSE OF DEATH NOTE is to show these two conflicting theories on justice. One side (Light) believes that by eliminating evil, the world will become a better place for the innocent. However, the other side (L and Light's father) believe that there is no true good or evil, and that kira is a hypocrite for killing murderers, yet refusing to acknowledge the fact that he is a serial killer himself."
xperierfx,I was entertained,08/10,21-Nov-17,"I have never been a fan of the Death Note anime/manga and I only really ever heard of this series fully when the Netflix show was released. Yes, everything may be different from the anime/manga but my opinion on that is that it's a good thing. It gives a whole new story towards the genre. I'm just a little confused on how this gets targeted, yet something like the Maze Runner isn't. The Maze Runner movie series, especially the The Scorch Trials, are quite different from the books and I think that's cool because, like I said, it gives a new story towards it. Overall this movie really entertained me and I'm hoping for a sequel. :)

lfp-95745,Better than expected,08/10,03-Sep-17,"When i saw the 4.5 rating on this movie, after having watched the anime, i was obviously very sceptic about the movie. My girlfriend and me still decided to watch the movie, but we tried not to focus too much on the original anime story rather we tried to see it as a standalone.We were actually really surprised at how good Ryuk looked like. (must be tough to create ""demon"" characters without making them look comically)I've got to admit, a lot of the story was superficial (hence not 10 stars) though the plot made sense and was entertaining to watch.It obviously pales in comparison to the anime, but it's quite clear to me that it doesn't want to be compared to the anime, since so many things are essentially different.We've had a good time and I can wholeheartedly suggest to give it a shot."

pwrfrwrd,"A poorly ""Americanized"" version of a great story/anime/manga and mostly idea!",03/10,27-Aug-17,"We all lost out considerably in this ""ill conceived"" version of what was a great Anime! This is a depressingly abysmal interpretation of what (To me anyway.), was a uniquely engaging & twisted view of how reality/the world really worked behind the curtains. I feel the crucial fault lies in the arrogance that the only way a ""movie/film/TV show/ or even story"" could be a commercial success to American audiences, is to set it in the USA or tell it from that perspective, even if you have to completely change it.What really happens with such a ""blindly/arrogant"" view is that ""we, The audience/viewers/""Fans"""", of not just this film, but of any film or show, created by such a defective viewpoint lose out terribly!

blissmarshar,"Pretty terrible, but not as bad as everyone else is saying.",04/10,28-Jun-18,"I'm pretty particular when it comes to a faithful adaptation of really anything. If they adapted Neon Genesis Evangelion into a live action film I'd probably go into cardiac arrest. With that being said, I don't think anyone expected this film to really be amazing. I think it's an alright effort if a Death Note movie absolutely HAD to be made, but that's just what this film is: Unnecessary. Its lifeless, dull, the characters fall flat, aside from Dafoe's performance, which was pretty good. All in all, I think this movie is pretty inoffensive. It's not too hard to just not pay any mind to it. No one cares about the Dragonball movie, anyway. I have a feeling that in 4-5 years, fans of Death Note will look back on this film and think, ""I've seen worse."" This movie feels as if it's supposed to be campy, and if that's what the director was going for, then they did a pretty alright job.

matcuda,Not worth the time,01/10,05-May-18,"If you are a fan of the original series, do not watch this movie. I don't know why they made a live-action adaptation of the anime, but it could have at least stayed true to the original. The only thing they kept was 3 or 4 names and the title. The rest is just a grotesque representation of a great series and the only thing that this movie is good for is to be used as a warning that not every anime needs a live-action remake.

mattoonp,Don't watch this if you like the original anime,02/10,26-Aug-17,"I give some movies the benefit of the doubt and watch them despite critics. This movie, however, goes the way of Dragonball Evolution as I had to watch a rushed abomination of the source material. The few moments I liked were of Willem Dafoe's voice work for Ryuk as it is spot on from the original. Sadly, the rest of the actors did a terrible job though. L loses his calm and calculated nature; Light who shares that similar attitude becomes a completely different character. What was originally an anime psychological thriller quickly devolves into a poor excuse for a live action adaptation. Aside from that, some rules about the Death Note itself were blatantly disregarded and I believe that the story would've been way less messy if the movie had a longer run time. Although I'd hate to have to sit through any more of this garbage.Whether or not your a fan of the original Death Note series, this movie is not worth your time due to the overall sloppy nature of this film. If you haven't seen the anime I suggest you do so. Coincidentally it's also on Netflix. You'll have a far better time watching it."
orion32612,This movie is an INSULT to death note. What is the point of this?,02/10,03-Dec-20,"I don't easily rate anything below 6. This is the lowest score I have given any movie so far. I mean what the hell? What is it? If it were an independent movie, I would rate it 5.
But it is an adaption of DEATH NOTE? WHY DO THIS?
It is a disaster.

erikalb,Loved it!,10/10,04-Jan-18,"I love Japanese movies as they are very imaginative and creative unlike Hollywood movies. This was well made and very clever. 
It is a dark movie but it is meant to be a little funny sometimes so that it is not too creepy. The actors did a fantastic job recreating the anime.
I really hope they make a second one and make more movies like this!
Please do not write bad reviews simply because you are simple minded, you are ruining chances of future similar movies being made and instead they will make movies for dummies like ""The Hangover"" .Please make a Death Note sequel!

dianabecerraroman,Any resemblance to the original characters or plot is purely coincidental.,02/10,20-Apr-19,"I totally agree with Antonio. There is no trace of the well-prepared characters and plot I enjoyed in the anime version. In the former one we could enjoy dynamic characters who move the plot forward with their actions, whilst the 2017 is riddled with flat characters not contributing in making the story more interesting.

starwars-49776,GREAT FILM,10/10,23-Apr-19,"I thought this was a beautiful film. The ending was amazing. The story was very well written could've dealt without the romance I thought Adam Wingard did a fantastic job. So did the actors. Creating a live adaptation is more difficult than people realize and I think this cast did a great job. I hope if they make more sequels they do really good with the casting of Near and Mello. And keep the same cast. It would've been better in more personal opinion to be released in theaters.but all in all it was a lot of fun. A whole new world of storytelling g to explkre.

lucyjeen,Why this is the worst adaptation .,01/10,16-Apr-23,"The live action Death note, was a bad stain on Netflix's reputation. First off there's one Asian person in the entire movie. Lights family isn't in it, Misa (a main character) isn't in the movie, instead they white it up, and call her Mia and makes her kill herself while light is in love with you her, unlike how Light is just using misa in the anime. And yes I will compare this trash to the anime/manga, because that's what it's directly taken from and Netflix should not be able to NVER make live action anything again. And if they do at least get it right. It's so disrespectful and disappointing they would change/not put in/take out so many important details, and characters."

daylus-23646,Sadly lacking,03/10,13-Oct-19,"I am a fan of the anime from years ago but looked forward to seeing a different take on the idea. Sadly, this just didn't grab me. I've never been a fan of b list horror films which is certainly where I would place this.The reactions and relationships between characters were poorly done, the cast not great and the pace way too fast. It did certainly differ from the originals but I didn't enjoy it from the point of view of a fan of the anime or taking it as something separate.If I were a fan of cheep, easy to watch horrors and thrillers, I would probably have enjoyed it. But I'm not, so I didn't.

This move is not that bad, but is terrible remake for one of the best anime of all time. If you already watch original ""Death Note"" don't watch this because it make you to feel bad. But if you didn't watch original, you can watch this movie, but I recommend it to watch original after this movie to see the difference.

drummerjmm,Much better than the hate it keeps getting,08/10,26-Aug-17,"I don't get all the hate. They broke 18 hours of source material down to less than 2. Of course material is going to be lost in translation. Plot points are altered; character mannerisms are adjusted. These thing are necessary to accomplish the task, as have been the case in nearly every film adaptation in history.Harry Potter is terrible compared to the books, the Avengers will never capture what 54 years worth of comics contain, The Sword of Shannara's MTV (now Spike) live action is even further removed from Terry Brooks source work than this film is, and it too is acceptable for what it is. Etc Etc.Misa was a far stronger character here than in the anime. Light was a nobody rather than the center of attention in the start of the original, never showing his true smarts until the very end. L was MUCH more direct. For as much as these changes create a schism between the film adaptation and the anime, they worked. It allowed the story to be told in a way that fit the medium it was aimed for.To go into this expecting the same response you had from the original is simply asinine. Accept it for what it is, and enjoy this 'abridged' version. If you have not seen the anime and enjoy this movie, GO WATCH IT! If you thought the movie was 'meh' without having seen the anime, GO WATCH IT! If you hated the movie but loved the anime, GO WATCH THE ANIME AGAIN (it's worth it, so why not?). It all serves the purpose of promoting Death Note into new crowds, so that people unfamiliar get the chance to enjoy it as many of us already had."

billiam9366-564-134021,A fan of the anime but...,08/10,25-Aug-17,"To me the second half of the anime stumbes and falls and made me lose a lot of interest and the show is more tamed compared to the movie. The movie moves a long quick and i like that. I like the darker tones and it feels more like a final destination movie mixed with the movie ""Nerve"". I like the different take. I don't like watching things in repeat. If they remake movies i want something different. I want variety. The shinning is a prime example of how something can be different and out shine the original. If you haven't seen the anime you may enjoy it more than if you have. I love both. Be unique and be open.

garysaum,Great stand alone movie.,08/10,14-Sep-20,"Don't be swayed by the anime crowd who have their expectation squashed because it didn't exactly follow the TV show. It was a well done movie with a great story line. Regardless of whether it does or does not meet the expectations created by the Manga/Anime it is a great story on its own right. The characters are believable though L is the least believable of the characters. at the end of the movie, L's Snap comes off a little forced as we also see with Daenerys Targaryen when she burns King's Landing."

If you have ever seen the original anime or read the manga then this film will irritate you worse than walking through a fresh patch of poison ivy.The plot was incredibly poor considering they had access to all the original source material and the characters have become one dimensional and unforgivably dull.I wish I had something more positive to end on, however not even my beloved Willem Dafoe could stop this from being a complete waste of an evening. I would advise anyone interested to heed the warnings and watch/read any of the other death note series."

efesahin-63944,I am just happy that I could survived first 5 min,01/10,17-Jul-21,"So guys, yea I am still alive after watched first 5 minute. It is better for your mental and physical health not to watch this. Go watch anime one more time instead of the time you will spend here. Idk maybe just start a company and life will be better for you. You might study your exams. I am totally sad that I cant give 0 to this movie(I am not sure it is movie or something tho) So please do not make any more live actions for animes. Thanks.

dboelin,Good for western version,08/10,30-Aug-17,"It's entertaining for everyone who never watched the original...consider this is the Hollywood version of Japanese's epic DeathNote.. The acting is averages but the all fresh faces actor are really refreshing ..everything is there ..this movie really good for start the trilogy. Btw, The devil offering us the new option to fulfill our desire..and yes , we want it ..deep inside ...the death note ."
ashcgoodlang,i couldnt even get past the first 10 minutes,02/10,17-Nov-20,"Ryuk is the psychopath? Light isnt charismatic, smart, calm, and psychopathic? wtf. The whole point is the death note reveals Light's crazy not that he would be told by Ryuk to kill people. And the fact that Ryuk said he chose Light specifically. Ryuk says in the original anime that Light thinking he was chosen is just arrogance. It randomly came into his possession in the original anime which is an important detail as it shows that despite this fact, Light develops a god complex quite quickly."
qhhmqbcqfmbrxbmcwmw,Shame,02/10,26-Dec-20,"I know its quite late for reviews, buy i gotta get it outa my chest. Seen the anime over 10 years ago, and stumbled across this monstrosity just today. Enough to say that now i remember why i don't watch american movies anymore since rec/quarantine and the ring adaptations.

anthas-84156,fine movie!!,10/10,21-Jun-21,"It's obviously not going to follow the anime and was never going to!It's a fine retelling and interesting live action film of the story using the same characters and principles. I'm happy with acting i like Wolff but everyone so quick to bash because it doesn't follow exactly with the anime and manga but chill out people. If you appreciate the story of the death note then just sit back and watch a couple hours of content following the Death Note, Light, Ryuk, L, ect.But stop the hate.

Music choice? Awful. Directing? Awful. Ryuk? Thought he was Jim Carry's The Grinch with a lil' demon twist. Could have done better, but just seemed like a weird excuse for a gory teen love movie.

kazacola,I enjoyed,08/10,22-Jun-21,"Some mediocre acting, they weren't terrible but clearly the budget for actors was spent on William Defoe. However I found the film rather entertaining, almost like Final Destination meets The Crow. Some others are upset as its nothing like the Manga/Anime series but I believe this stands well on its own. It was fun, light hearted easy watching whilst remaining dark.

Light being some random loser that nobody cares about is just insane.. must be some school traumatism of the movie director.L is somehow even worse (though I can admit such a character would be very difficult even for a real actor)And honestly just about everything.

kayleeland,I have never been more disappointed with a film,01/10,01-Sep-17,"Just...for the love of god, watch the anime or read the manga. This movie does nothing but kill brain cells. Cliché, flat, poorly written with actors who either sucked the life out of their character or tried too hard to the point where they looked completely ridiculous...I don't even know HOW the creators of this film thought that this would please any real Death Note fan and the fact that the director claimed to be a fan of the original material makes me even angrier with this adaption. Dumbing down the American adaption gives people who haven't seen the original the wrong impression of Death Note. It is not some teen horror romance with flat characters and a plot line as weak as water. It is so much more than that, it is complex and psychologically challenging. This film is uninspired and ridiculous. I do not want to be associated with this whenever my friend sees me reading the manga or hears me talking about the anime. THIS FILM IS NOT DEATH NOTE. THESE CHARACTERS ARE NOT THE ONES ANIME AND MANGA FANS HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH. I hope Hollywood learns from the negative reaction to this film: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. Side note: Nat Wolff's portrayal of Light was completely laughable. Every scene he was in made me cringe, especially when he started SCREAMING LIKE THAT....Took me right out of the film and the experience. Completely missed the mark here. Only wish I could give it a 0 rating."
caseyjtrue,An Undervalued Reimagining,08/10,18-Dec-21,"Unlike most people who watched this film, I understood going in that this wasn't supposed to be a proper adaptation; but rather a reimagining. It's an interesting take on the ""what if"" style of storytelling and deserves more credit than what most ""fans"" of the source material will say. Not to say the film is without flaws. But one must remember that you can't judge the actions of Light Turner based on the actions of Light Yagami; they're different characters in different universes.

donnywayne,Thoroughly entertained!,08/10,27-Aug-17,"All I ask from movies/TV shows is to entertain and/or educate me. For example a TV show such as ""Speechless"" on ABC both entertains me (it's slap hilarious!) and educates me by providing a window into the lives of a family living with a special needs (in this case cerebral palsy) member. I say this up front to let it be known that I'm not one of these anime zealots that are determined to nitpick and way over-analyze everything about this film. I have never read the anime or seen any of the other film adaptations therefore I had no preconceived notions going in. I thoroughly enjoyed this film for one hour and forty minutes! Yes, maybe a bit shallow, but there's only so much you can cram into an hour and forty minutes! Is it the best film ever? No. Is it identical to the source material? Apparently not. I couldn't care less. It entertained me!!! If you want a fun, entertaining hour and forty minute ride - give this a chance. These of you overly critical ""reviewers"" - get out of your parents' (or grandparents') basements and get a life!

davidveramarul,A big mistake,01/10,28-Aug-17,"I never made this before, but this movie is a reason (sad one) to write about the media, producers, cast and Netflix. First, the cast is so bad and show a lot of mistakes with the American style. The most important idea for the original story is not in the movie, THE MORAL DISCUSSION OF KILL BAD PEOPLE FOR A BETTER WORLD. Second, Light is weak and a complete looser and Misa is just an attention whore with alternative girl tendency. Ryuk is like the devil and he is so interested in kill people, not in Light and his abilities, and Netflix build a story where Light is a victim of Ryuk. Last part is the most sad ever, L is a stupid cop, violent and he made mistakes that a intelligent person did not do. CONCLUSION, THIS MOVIE IS A BIG MISTAKE FOR DEATH NOTE AND NETFLIX."

Light yagami's name is changed to light Turner and he's a lot more clumsy, he's a lot more indecisive. I watched this movie expecting a good adaptation of my favorite anime but I was severely disappointed honestly I would not recommend watching it you know some movies are so bad they're good this one's just bad it's boring to sit through it feels way longer than it is, I'd like to see an adaptation that actually is good.

sophisabelc,I wish I could rate it less.,01/10,04-Oct-22,"I watched this film without much hope, yet somehow I was still disappointed. It was so American it felt like a parody, and the complete lack of characterisation was almost impressive in its ability to turn any 3D character into something as flat and as bland as a cracker. Speaking of, the actors in said film seemed to give it their all, and were let down by the abysmal scripting, which seemed to take most of its inspiration from something a 12 year old would write in order to appear edgy. Somehow this film managed to offend me as it felt the need to spoon-feed me the themes it was supposed to be addressing. I have seen more subtlety in addressing difficult themes such as morality in two dogs fighting over a bone. However, I will allow it to have one star, as I appreciate the frugality of saving money by refusing to bother to animate Ryuk by simply always making sure he was in shadow. By the end, I wished Light had put his own name in the Death Note, followed by my own.

gunnarprater,This Movie Sucks WAY Too Much!!!!,03/10,07-Sep-23,"Say what you want about this movie, it sucks too much. Light is not the A+ honor role student that he is in the anime, L. Actually goes out into public, Light second guesses himself, which the real Light Yagami would NEVER under ANY circumstance, James doesn't support L.'s decision to confront Light at all, he completely freaks out when L. Tells him that he's keeping tabs on Light, which is something Soichiro barely did in the anime and allowed him to do it, Light didn't take out the FBI Agents, Light doesn't intend on killing Mia like he did in the anime, instead, he actually falls for her?! Also - pardon me for this long review on this God awful Netflix adaption - Watari is not a first and last name!! Why would L. Just go into the Turner house randomly and just accuse Light of being Kira and throw a tantrum?! That is not our Ryuzaki, people!!!I'm not sure if it's even a real name! The only good thing about it is Willem Dafoe as Ryuk and Lakeith Stanfield's acting as L. I'm just glad that they didn't make Watari American and come up with a different name for him."
zylofan,Took the characters names and threw out the rest.,03/10,04-Sep-17,"Death Note 2017 is just a plain bad implementation of the original source material that tries to do its own thing, and follow the source material at the same time and ends up doing neither well.The little enjoyment I got from the movie was from laughing at how terrible it was, pointing out the numerous plot holes with my friends, and seeing some good acting from both Willem Dafoe's performance as Ryuk and Lakeith Stanfield's performance as L (when the script actually allowed either of them to act like their original characters)Sadly another American movie trying to capitalize on a popular anime/manga and missing the point of why people liked it in the first place.

adamawsome-32789,This movie is actually a decent movie,08/10,26-Aug-17,"Hi, I have just watched ""Death Note (2017) on Netflix and would like to leave my thoughts about it down below. Okay, I know that there is a lot of hate for this movie, but people need to understand that it wasn't that bad.I personally have never seen the anime or original movie, but I basically knew the backstory. I watched this movie and honestly, I think the movie was good. I think the story line was well done, the story was appealing, and the cliffhanger had me wanting a sequel. People proclaim that this movie wasn't good because of whitewashing (which is not a topic that i'm going to go into) and said the story is boring. I personally think that if you think the story is boring, you're really not appreciating the movie for its potential or you're just assuming it's not a good movie because of early assumptions.I liked the movie. If you have never seen it, yes it is different from the anime, but many movies are different from books...their still good movies. My point is that if you give ""Death Note"" a chance and really watch the movie and realize how well done it is maybe you'll change your opinion about it or maybe even reconsider your thoughts about it all together."
joseaznar-76782,Great prequel,08/10,25-Aug-17,"It starts good, continues a bit mediocre, but has a great ending to show the way of the sequel. Not the best movie on it's own (specially for the anime fans), nevertheless, if we look at it as a fresh origin of Light Yagami for a movie series, then I consider it will be a reference for future anime to live action transitions.On the other hand, it's worth mentioning that it's not a loyal representation (at all) of the anime, but, as I previously stated, I like the alternate origin for the anime's character and personality (at the end they seem to recover Light's anime personality)."

While I can fully appreciate someone taking a popular concept and recreating it in their own vision, I feel that there are some things that should just be left as is. The original anime takes place in Japan, while the remake takes place in Seattle. Obviously, there are going to be cultural differences. However, diversion from the original series does not stop there. It was physically painful to sit through this film and watch how out-of-character all of the main characters were.Light Yagami, who in the anime is portrayed to be a cunning, deductive, resourceful genius who stays two steps ahead of the game and can weasel his way out of anything. His God complex and conviction make him a fascinating character. Even when Light is panicking, he always seems to have a plan. However, Light Turner as poorly portrayed by Nat Wolf, seems hesitant, uncertain and cracks under pressure. Much of anime Light's appeal comes from that he's an above average student with capabilities of a man far older than 17, but there is no mistaking that movie Light is a naive, troubled high school student.I was also devastated to find that the creators of this film chose to exploit the relationship between Light and Misa/Mia for the sake of appealing to a younger audience, pushing Light even further out of character. In the anime, Light sees Misa as a bother, and uses her strictly for his own personal gain without ever wavering in his ultimate goal in making the world a better place by purging it of those who would do it harm. In the movie, Light and Mia get caught up in a whirlwind romance based on their shared secret of Light possessing the death note. Events that take place in the film would have never occurred in the anime because Light Yagami would have never allowed Misa to intervene with his plans. Arguably, one of the most compelling components of the anime is the power struggle between Light and L, two characters who are clever and cunning in their own right. However, L seems jumpy, irate, and panicked throughout most of the film, losing his composure on several occasions, and lashing out at Light in frustration. Overall, I felt this film failed to capture several different events that took place in the anime that highlighted how smart and calculated both Light and L are. To imply that the main giveaway that Light was Kira is because he refused to kill his own father after he appeared on television is absolutely outrageous, even if things did need to be cut for the sake of condensing an entire series into a film. I also had a serious issue with Ryuk's appearance. He just looked bad. The only thing I liked about this movie was the chase scene towards the end when L went after Light, and they unnecessarily knocked over innocent bystanders who weren't even really in their way."
monicabola,Let down..,04/10,26-Aug-17,"So much potential for this movie and it was a let down. Loved the anime, but not the film. The actors didn't seem to fit the roles they were meant to play, L wasn't convincing enough for me and Ryuk didn't play much of a part in the film as I was hoping for. Let's see if Death Note 2 ever gets made.....

midnightsun-185-430788,Great movie if you've never heard of death note before,08/10,11-Jun-18,"I can see this film has upset a lot of people who loved the source material. Well, I'd never heard of Death Note before coming across this while browsing through Netflix. It just seemed like an interesting premise and I had some time to kill before going to bed. So I gave it a go. And I loved it!!!
So, that's it in a nutshell. If you've seen and read everything about the original version then you might want to avoid this like the plague. But if you just want to see a decent entertaining movie with decent humour, mildly challenging moral dilemmas, a relateable anti-hero and a light bit of comedy gore then this is the movie for you.
Coming at this from a blank slate, I liked the characters even though some were a little underdeveloped, I liked the premise of this god-like power literally falling out of the sky, and how the certainty of those decision can get quickly eroded as time goes on. I even liked the over-elaborate deaths scenes despite them reminding me of what the Final Destaination franchise did years ago.
Ok, I get that there's probably a whole world of backstory and source material out there, but I've not seen/read any of that so I went in with zero knowledge and zero expectation. If you can do that too then I would highly reocmmmed this film.
Special meniton goes to Willem Defoe who is the perfect voice for this likeably mischievous version of Ryuk. It's a shame he doesn't get enough screen time to flesh out the complex mix of power and betrayal between a death god and the human he effectively serves. I'd have loved to have seen more of that.
The end isn't quite as clever as it thinks it is, and it does wrap things up a bit too quickly, but it still made me smile and I came away happy.
Overall, I'd watch this again. And I'd love to see a sequel to expand on the story. Judging by what other reviewers have said there must be loads of old stories to draw on so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for more.
Give it a go. But leave any preconceptions behind you before you sit down to watch it."
archievourliotis,Equal to dragon ball evolution and worse,01/10,29-Aug-17,One of the most awful live action transfer of an anime... At least the Japanese when making live action from anime stick to the story... The politically correct with every movie nowadays is getting out of hand.. L is not black... Kira=Light was never manipulated by human trash like Mia in the movie. really poor effort on the making ... You have an amazing scenario rated 9 out of 10 and you managed to drop it in an abyss deeper than 20000 leagues... that's all ... not even worth watching... don't make the mistake i did.
marios-eu,Hubris,01/10,08-Sep-17,"It is the first time I bother writing a review, but I feel compelled to do so as death note is my favorite manga. I wonder if the original author had any idea of the script and gave permission for the creation of this utter garbage ?it is a shame that the best manga is humiliated. Apart from being a terrible film in all aspects in general, there are also certain points where it becomes ridiculous

hisroyalbonkess,"Good On Its Own, Needs To Be Criticized Separately From Source Material",07/10,02-Sep-17,"Okay, so logical inconsistencies such as why Light would even take the Death Note to school aside, this movie is good. Not great, mind you, but good.This feels like it was directed by a guy heavily influenced by early 2000s dramas and Superhero films, and that's okay.The ending being left up for interpretation is great, and the characters themselves we're actually somewhat relatable until the end where Light is particularly not upset that his name is in the DN. Like, I know he can't freak out in the middle of Homecoming, but he could be a little more upset.Mia is a genuine scumbag and that is actually apparent from the get-go. Once the 12 FBI agents were killed, it was either Ryuk or Mia who was the traitor.All in all, is this movie the anime? No. Far from it. Does it not being the anime make it bad? No. It's its own piece of work, and should be treated as such. It's not as bad as people say."
ciproco,"It's a different movie, not the anime! Get over it, you haters!",07/10,20-Dec-17,"I don't understand all the low ratings. I am a huge fan of the anime and the manga and I was very excited of what could come of this (expectably, from the trailer!) different story. Well, the acting is good, the characters are spot on and the story is thrilling. It's just not a dull remake of the tv series! Get over it! Don't hate just for hating, give it a shot with a clear mind. Death Note (2017) can surprise you!

solaris-70032,Better than I expected,06/10,20-Sep-17,"As previous posters have said, it's not that good. BUT it's not that bad either. It's a solid 6 in my opinion.On to the good: The deaths are actually good and more more brutal than I thought Netflix would allow/show. Another good about this adaptation is the cinematography. The lighting was good and the angles for certain shots were good as well.Now for the bad: The characters lack development, unlike the anime/manga. The actors chosen for Light and L both are pretty bad at what they do, enough said. The script is borderline lackluster and lacks depth.And finally the ugly: It's short. Far too short. I understand it's a two part-er but still. 1 hour 40 minutes is far too short for a masterpiece like Death Note. Hopefully part 2, budget willing, will be better planned.Final thoughts: If you liked the anime/manga, then give this movie a shot. It's not as good as the ones from years ago but still isn't a bad watch."
woodstockalex910,Good B Movie,07/10,15-Oct-17,"Is it a good movie? No. Is it a good representation of the original work? Definitely not. Is it a fun watch? YES! This movie isn't going to win any awards, but it's a good movie to sit, watch, and make fun of with a few friends. And sometimes that's all you can ask for. Nat Wolff is a mess as Light, Margaret Qualley is passable as Mia, and Willem Dafoe does a great job as Ryuk. So if you are looking for a good story, with well written characters, and several thrilling moments throughout, go watch the original. But if you want a fun, kinda garbage couple of hours, give this a watch.

itchx,Not Even Close,02/10,27-Sep-17,"So, I (finally) managed to watch the Netflix Original 'Death Note' Film, and I must say that I was thoroughly uninspired. I won't go into detail about how much I hated the adaptation of such a masterpiece, but I will say that there were several HUGE problems, that pretty much ruined the whole movie for me : 1) Setting - I won't even say much about this because it is pretty obvious, and I could probably write a whole goddamn paper on it, but the fact that they set the adaptation in Seattle, rather than Japan already puts the character developments at a great disadvantage. You have two VERY different cultures, that have very opposite social decorum, expectations, and values, and you try to make them parallels of each other, which honestly for me, is an improbable job. The true essence of the characters which relies upon how they act and react to stimuli is a battle that is influenced by their nature and how they're nurtured. So when the nature has already been changed, you no longer have the same characters; you can't strive to have the same impact or outcome.2) Light - The most amazing thing about Light as a protagonist is that he is a highly-functioning, intelligent sociopath with a God Complex. He exudes the image of perfection, and that is one of the many things that drives him to take this mantle of responsibility, because he honestly believes that he is without sin, and that absolutely gives him the right to judge others. But this movie has managed to reduce him to an emotionally-driven simpleton with a moral conscious. And that's the thing about Light! His ethics are his own, his moral conscious is his own, so as the reader/viewer you can go as far as to say that Light has neither a moral conscious nor is he bound by societal ethics. Why would a god need to do that?!3) Mia - OMG! She was honestly the biggest flaw of this movie. To have such an intricate psychological thriller degraded to a clichéd, messed-up teen love story gets me so mad, that I'm not even gonna stay anything more about it.4) Watari - Who? The fact that they used this character as a loophole to get to L is such a cop-out. And I may have missed it, but I don't even think Light knew his full name, but he somehow managed to influence him.5) Ryuk - I actually enjoyed the character design for Ryuk. He was honestly a thing of beauty (props to the computer peeps involved), and I think as a Westernized adaptation, you couldn't have found a better Ryuk than Willem Dafoe. With that said, I really didn't like how they portrayed Ryuk as the one influencing the endgames to cause the maximum amount of evil for the major crimes that happen in the movie, when in both the manga and the anime, he is a pretty neutral character. He was just a super bored death god, who dropped his notebook to create a little chaos. The dude honestly just stayed for the apples and the show.Truthfully, this movie had the potential to be good, but it flopped for me. Why? Because I think the medium used is not enough to tell the story. If you're going to attempt to recreate a story as complex as this one, do a short-series, a multi-episode medium that brings out the layers of a story as interesting as 'Death Note'. The story is already written for you, performed and adapted for you, so make it better. Don't take away from the essence of it, especially if you're translating it across cultures; translate it well and thoroughly. Or they could have had Japanese characters and kept the cultural integrity of the story, but still set it in Seattle. Stop cutting corners to get an ending you didn't work to set up properly. P.S. I didn't forget L, I just didn't find any major problems with his character adaptation that ruined him for me, apart from the obvious ending. I think Lakeith played him fairly well. If they had portrayed him as a bit less human (emotions-wise), more neurotic and like the utter oddball that he is, his character would have been right on the nose. So these are my thoughts on this movie."
melowsloth,Absolute failure.,01/10,28-Sep-17,"What made the whole anime my favorite of all time was the battle of intelligence between Light and L. I saw no intelligence in this whole movie. Light was just an average kid and even L seemed dumb. Not even finished watching and i'm writing the first ever movie review of my life.

stefania982,DON'T WATCH!,01/10,31-Dec-20,"This is my first review, I could really not stop the urge to tell you DON'T WATCH IT!!!! Nothing in this movie is worth to be watched: not photography, not actors, and definitely not the story!Real death note is something else. It is not this uselessly dark.Here you have a complete distorsion of the story, everything is dark and dull. It is unbelievably slow paced and boring. It has nothing that makes you think ""I want to watch more"". Actual it makes you ask yourself why you are wasting your time. I watched it all only to see how far this could go to destroy such a great story.Boring, useless. Love story none-sense in the film.
Riuk from one of the main caracthers to this joke (not a funny one) of himself.Save your time and watch Japanese anime or film."
gifted-genius,An unbelievable amount of potential gone to waste.,03/10,27-Aug-17,"I have never written a review of a movie or show in my life so far. However as someone who grew up on Deathnote when the anime originally aired in North America, I was excited but very skeptical about them making this movie. I will get straight too the point. Like I do with all marvel and DC movies, I try too disregard and forget that the source materials exist for their live action movies and it has always worked very well. I did this exact same thing for Air bender, and some what enjoyed the movie because of it, However doing it for deathnote, was hard. Not just noticing all the mistakes and changes they did, But when it comes down too the acting, lights character in this version, Mia, Just everything about it in general. Lights character was completely changed. Lights character is suppose to be intelligent, cunning, deceitful, and too a good extent cruel. But in this movie, hes like a christan kid with morals trying too be the villain. It felt off, not right. I will conclude my review with this, as I don't even want too get started with how they Destroyed L's character."
shahshubh-87747,Butchering Anime since Dragonball Evolution,03/10,27-Aug-17,"If you were expecting an actual, dedicated film adaptation of the source material - Death Note, refrain from watching; you will be disappointed. As a standalone film, refrain from watching; better watch the death note anime instead. The pacing of the film is horrible coupled with horrible acting and character development apparently means nothing. The concept could have been used so fantastically but is wasted in this coming of age, romance horror film which does only one thing best - Ryuk that too when compared to original is pretty bad. So if you do want to watch it- DON'T!

annahl-bee,Japan version is better,01/10,25-Jan-21,"First thing first, shinigami is doesnt match with western.
But it is more acceptable if theiy were consider to make an sekuel of its original japan live action, instead of remake.
Second. CGI on ryuk is very very bad.. its a downgrade from original live action.

The best part of this movie is the end-absolutely gut wrenching and the musical accompaniment really adds to it.

azv-54389,Unpopular opinion but...,08/10,25-Jan-18,".......I actually liked it.It was enjoyable. I was admittedly quite dubious when I saw pictures of the cast but not even two minutes in and I was won over by the humanness of this Light and his girlish screaming. Rather than a sociopathic genius we saw normal teenage guy (though obviously rather intelligent) dealing with teenage-esque drama and an obvious moral code. It was even more relatable that despite his good intentions Light still sometimes wavered in his convictions due to peer pressure and wanting to impress as most people do. Mia was also very enjoyable and very different from Misa in the anime in that she was quite obviously ""darker"" than Light in this.L was another character I was deeply impressed by. He seemed to convey eveyrthing that was L - his intelligence, convictions and even eccentricities all with a side of humanity which allowed us to feel a closer connection to him and empathise with him throughout the film.Most impressive of all is that, just like with the original anime, I found myself rooting for both L and Light throughout the film. This is in no way a comparison with the original anime - these are two separate renditions and should be treated as such. If you came here expecting the exact same characters portrayed in the exact same way as in the anime then you will be disappointed. But for those who are able to view this as an alternate version of what could be if similar but different characters were in these same situations you will appreciate this film.In conclusion, a very enjoyable, funny film with rather brilliantly timed music throughout. A definite must-see."
tatiana-sousa5,This adaptation isn't good,01/10,20-Nov-17,"I'm a fan of the manga Death Note and I decided to watch this movie even though I heard that it wasn't good but I wanted an opinion of my own. Well... I agree, it wasn't good, in fact, is the worst movie I ever seen in my life. The magic of Death Note was the fight between Light and L, they were both super smart, rational and calm people. Light has no feelings and L is not an impulsive person as this movie shows. In here Light is bullied and L is a schizophrenic. Also, L would never talk in public and Watari wouldn't show his face to everybody, and even the rules in the book were bad. Those rules were discovered by Light (in the anime) and he is smart enough to make plans to escape L but in this movie Light wasn't rational and made so many mistakes. So, I found this movie really bad, the characters' personalities were horrible, the movie was really rushed and the end was just as bad as the all movie. I was so mad about this movie that I actually create an account in here just to write this review and I say to you, people who like the anime/manga, do not watch this movie."
vampyiregutz,As you'd expect,03/10,27-Aug-17,"I signed up for an account for this website just to state as a warning in case you couldn't really think reasonably; do NOT watch this movie.While I cannot speak for all, I certainly can say that I am more than DISAPPOINTED with this movie. Not only do they completely white wash this movie, remove everything from the story except the main characters and BARELY holding onto the concept. I can say that the production quality is decent, the acting is great and so are the effects. But production aside, it needs good PLOT.I couldn't sit through the movie as it was just a mind boggling cluster of so many different idea's crammed into 2 hours of a Netflix movie. I can safely say that the 30 minutes I sat through were just the same as the other hour and a half. Overall/TL;DR: The idea's in this are poorly executed and do not portray the story nor characters well. If you're looking for a death note movie, watch the J-drama on CrunchyRoll. It stays loyal to the manga and honestly has great characters, acting, and overall isn't in Seattle Washington based on a crumbling suburban family."
mihaelapeace,Critical Analysis of Death Note based on an Understanding Television course,03/10,27-Nov-17,"Throughout the film the one-hundred-and-eighty-degree rule is not broken, that is when the camera does not go past that degree to protect the positioning of other cameras (personal communication, Rahman, September 18th, 2017). To show the setting, characters and their positioning, the shot and reverse shot is used to allow the viewer to comprehend what is going on from the perspectives of the characters, giving the show a more realistic feeling, like viewers are in the room (Fiske, 1987). The producers attempt to provide a realistic feeling through the use of special effects that were later on added to accomplish the supernatural events that occur though out the film. On behalf of the director and everyone involved in producing Death Note, it is clearly a smart move to produce the show since there is already such a huge platform that is already built with a solid amount of audiences. The movie was previously created in a cartoon format, TV series and now a film. The audience is such a large group of the population that a ""death note"" book has been created to keep the interest alive. These commodities give audience feelings that reproduce the text because of the feelings that they inflict (Groening, 2010). The globalization of Death Note has reached many nations by the organization of a format fiction, where the adaptations have basic values of the original story but it is locally produced, with different actors and settings (Hilmes, 2013). Overall this adaptation poorly kept to the story and failed to keep me interested."
isil-arslann,Terrible.,01/10,09-Sep-17,"Here's the death note entry for this movie. Death Note (2017), total obliteration. After the producers see the source material, they think of the worst possible way to obliterate the franchise; choosing terrible actors (except one who will not be named in this entry), a child to write the script, with a ""I know a guy"" CGI effects. Within 2 hours of the release during the 25th of August, 2017, the movie itself becomes unstable, with signs of collapse becoming more apparent after each unfinished viewing. It eventually explodes with disappointing effects, temporarily scarring the daring individuals who wanted to see a new adaptation of Death Note we all love.Seriously, do not watch this and save your time.

rithvikgv-783-95987,Waste of time,01/10,08-Sep-17,"Work acting. Worst screenplay. The two best characters L and Light are horrible cast. Light is better, but L is the worst casting decision. Waste of 2 hrs. The L characterization is very poorly progressed. It diverges from the original plot, and makes a nightmare for any death note fan to watch. Watch the movie to hate it.

chinoldin_98,Is crap,01/10,07-Jun-18,"This movie is crap comparing to the anime, the whole story is not even in the movie, the ending is totally differente to the anime"
Dariel_Embry,Please Read this review,01/10,14-Oct-18,"Ok so I see a lot of bashing and a lot of love for this film. I'm saying this to really explain where the bashing comes from. If you hadn't seen the anime then of course you would enjoy this film as it's a very interesting concept, HOWEVER the anime and manga tells the story so much better and is honestly 1000 more interesting. The film is a dumbed down version of the anime as if to say America isn't smart enough to enjoy the original story line. Please please please take the time to watch the anime it is in English dub as well as English subtitled if you want to watch it in Japanese. You will enjoy it wayyyy more. Light and L are two of the most ""rivals"" or ""enemies"" you can think of. They're constantly trying to outwit each other. Think of it as a very intense game of chess where the film is honestly just a cat and mouse film.

eransama,Might be the worst movie ever,01/10,02-Nov-17,"The original manga is an amazingly smart and interesting. The movie, not even compared to the original story is horrible. It's dumb, it's boring, it's stupid. The writers should stick to their day jobs, they can't be doing it as bad as writing screenplays. The acting is not good. The effects are pretty bad. But really, it doesn't matter - the story is so ridiculous that everything else doesn't matter. I was wondering maybe the movie was made as a joke.. but it didn't feel like it. Don't waste your time.

lemmypaws,Intermittently entertaining but rushed,03/10,30-Aug-17,"I had not written a review before but I felt like I had to let future viewers know. This movie was nothing like the TV series and featured a very rushed plot. If you haven't seen the series ahead of time, then you might enjoy it, otherwise, you will be disappointment as I was. The show featured a few scenes where you would want to know what happens next. I felt like these solutions were cut off abruptly, just like the movie itself.

prosperity-83760,Like toddlers playing chess..,02/10,25-Aug-17,"This is what happens when you take something absolutely brilliant and leave to lesser minds to rework. The story is about the battle between brilliant minds, not whatever this was. This is the emotional equivalent of adding a happy ending to Romeo and Juliet because you think that is what the audience will like. It entirely missed the mark, like winning a game of chess by overturning the table.

lysslyss668,Fully enjoyed it! Of course it's not just like the anime!,07/10,27-Aug-17,"This film should be viewed with a more open mindset. It's getting a bed rep, but it wasn't suppose to be an identical match to the anime series. While I agree that this film differed greatly from the original in terms of character traits and overall vibe, I still believe it was a great Westernized version. If anything, people who watch this first may be compelled to watch the original and love it even more! It got me excited to watch the original over again so I can experience the characters in their true depth.

m-wish95,The people who made this movie hated Death Note and wanted to watch it die.,01/10,05-Jun-19,"This is literally the first movie review I am writing here and that is only because I just could not stay silent!I have seen the original anime a few years ago and I loved it because of the intellectual battle and mind games between light and L. I think that was the very core of the story which is completely ruined by this movie.Light, the brilliant, cold and charismatic character who was driven by his sense of justice to use death note in order to create a better world is portrayed as a clumsy, not so bright, coward teen who simply reveals the biggest secret of his life only seconds after some random cheerleader talks to him. The intellect that draws you into light's character is almost non-existent in the movie, instead, you are left with an overly sensitive, easily influenced underdog who seems to be killing people not because of his philosophical viewpoint about justice but only under the influence of Ryuk and his crazy girlfriend. You never see light planning ahead on anything until the very end of the movie which you saw him make a very stupid plan that you could easily foresee.L, the also brilliant detective with weird habits and a sweet tooth is portrayed as a crazy bad tempered person who you never actually see making logical and smart moves and instead just see him do bad chasing scenes running and crashing things for no apparent reason. And at the end it kinda looked like they wanted us to believe that L is gonna write Light's name in the death note which just looked stupid and out of character.Ryuk, the shinigami who was bored and dropped the death note to see some action was now portrayed as a manipulative force who encourages light to kill people while light himself seems to have no actual drive to do so. Mia who I think was supposed to be based on Misa who was obsessed with light is not just a psychopath who wants to murder people and does not actually care about Light at all. Light's father is also out of character. And hey! they made Light an orphan, way to hollywood things up!I do not think the writers or the director did actually understand why people loved death note or what was interesting about it. There is no intellectual battle, no breath taking plot turns no playing around with moral codes. One of the other interesting part about the original in my opinion was that how they made Light this really smart, attractive and charismatic man who you kinda want to root for even though he is evil while making L, the good guy, look disgusting and weird and make you respect and love him for his amazing intellect! However, in the movie you only see a misunderstood kid who has no idea what he is doing and you just hope for him to find his way.I believe, like almost every other person in here, that when the original plot is this brilliant, it is an insult to make a shallow adaptation like this. I did not have any problem with the cast, in fact I found Ryuk's voice to be pretty accurate and I think given the right plot, the actors were actually capable of portraying a good adaptations of the characters. However, the horrible plot and weird direction choices made this movie one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen."
ringo-zino,How to miss shooting a barn wall from the inside by Adam Wingard,01/10,07-Sep-17,"The plot is missing out on so much, the original franchise in both anime and manga format kept the tension and suspense around the Death Note as well as Light's alter ego Kira. Death Note as a franchise has always had good writing, regardless of if it was the characters, settings, or story. It was always intriguing and this movie misses every opportunity to use a great concept that's already been written and adapted to TV before. Adam Wingard really does his own thing with this franchise, in the worst ways possible. He completely disregards and strips down important character so that they become cheap knockoffs of their original works. The soundtrack that helped bring so much tension with high-paced piano music has been replaced with 80's cheesy love songs. The movie isn't scary, it's more like it's a well made YouTube parody of the franchise. That being said, well made YouTube parody does not insinuate well made movie. This movie doesn't know what it wants, it doesn't know where it's going, and it has no idea what it's doing with the elements presented to it. The acting is mediocre at most, with an exception of three characters, being Ryuk, L, and Watari. The main character Light Turner is played in a way that makes him more alike Toby Maguire's viral acting in the spiderman franchise rather than a ruthless killer with unethic morals. Another big problem I have with the movie is that not only did they feel the need to remove key characters like Rem and Near, (As well as Matt, Matsuda, Mello, Light's mother and sister), but they also completely changed Light's motivation to use the Death Note. Instead of truly believing he's doing the world a favor, he seems to use it in fear of being killed bu Ryuk or left by ""Mia"". Yes, they whitewashed almost the entire cast and names thinking it'd be OK if they somehow added one poc. But even though the main character's name is still Light, apparently calling someone Misa is not plausible. Speaking of the character, she's ballsier in this adaption and I like that. But what I completely hate is that Light actually has feelings for her which only makes it even more to a high school movie that's at most as scary as Life is Strange. It also fails to showcase Light as the crazy killer Kira he's supposed to be. All in all, the movie is super selective with what they wanted to keep from the original franchise. They did all the wrong picks though, preferring to keep the alter ego name Kira rather than, oh I don't know, the actual plot. I'm glad I watched this movie with friends, because I don't want to give it more views on Netflix than it already has. If you like the concept of the movie, I highly recommend you to check out the original manga and anime. You will not be disappointed."
j-holmberg87,Good Movie That's Worth A Watch.,07/10,14-Oct-17,"I decided to review this movie just based on the lack of non biased reviews. If you're like me and not familiar with the cartoon it's hard to find an honest review that isn't negative just based on deviation from the cartoon material.The movie has a good story and dives into the story line quickly. The acting isn't bad but could definitely be stronger. The effects are alright as well. Honestly, it kept me entertained though the whole movie and if you're like me with no prior knowledge of the cartoon, you can probably ignore 90% of the reviews and just have fun watching a pretty good movie.

madicruz,It needs a lot of work to live up to the original,01/10,26-Aug-17,"As I was watching this movie I noticed something something that I thought that was really stupid. In the enemy you would see a lot of suspense and a lot of death and a lot of other things. Like L for example El is not supposed to show up in the middle of the movie like he did in this movie the show you will build suspense when it came to l appearance. And when real kill people by himself other than light made me think that this movie has no meaning. But on the other hand if it were to have a little more like suspense when it came to like light and L and lights girlfriend has Mia to have a little more of a plot twist because they have a lot more history I should say and Misa has a Death Note of her own and she has the eyes of demon so she would help like but I don't see stuff like that in this movie I thought it was a corny and also l was supposed to be killed and one of his Protégé would live and kill light. Furthermore this didn't relate to the anime at all it was more of a like a retarded attempt of a movie

nmikeknight,Missed the point entirely,01/10,26-Aug-17,"I would ha e voted this a 0, however it would not let me do this. This is right up there with Twilight and Shakrnado or a downplayed cheesy horror flick. Some people may enjoy this film, if you are looking for a complex plot, developed characters or anything else to grab your attention look elsewhere. The Director clearly did not understand what made DeathNote interesting. It's like putting someone in a batman suit and pawning it off as Batman. The reason DeathNote was successful was not because of the plot device the DeathNote (Notebook ) but rather the character development, their intrinsic rivalry, opposed natures and the moral questions it asked that caused the viewer to ask themselves. It explored black and white as well as mapped out a lot of grey areas. It was complex and captivating....of course I am speaking of the Anime...NOT THE HORRIBLE NETFLIX FILM ADAPTATION!!!! Honestly these characters are poorly developed. Light Turner is an angsty teenager with a constipated look on his face who is just a poor actor. Mia who is basically Bella has the range of Kristen Stewart. She is completely undeveloped and troped as a 2-D girl who likes danger. That completes her arc. The most interesting but not by much is L, the 21st century Sherlock Holmes who falls short and falls short by every mark. The only reason I say he is the most interesting is because they added a very small dash of eccentric quirks that Anime friends would recognize. The only good factor is hearing Willem DaFoe voice Ryuk, though they did not learn from every other horror film or rendition of DeathNote. Ryuk looks silly. I get that they tried to make him scary but he comes off like a goofy Halloween mask. Honestly, they could have done a lot more, always having him in the shadows simply showing red eyes and having invisible bites of apples. You wouldn't be distracted by the low budget looking image they went with. Using the readers imagination is always a trick but no, they went low budget B flick route. I haven't written a review before on here but after waking up people in my house from screaming at this film from all the plot holes, cheesy romance, nonsensical crap that they force down your throat I thought it might help people cope that have seen it or have the new people skip this one instead."
chrisdevarona,Not an accurate adaptation,05/10,19-Oct-17,"While this is a very well created film it is not however accurate to the animated series which I am a fan of. I can understand that some things must have been changed for a reason, but at the same time details are supposed to be some what accurate. Light Yagame is his name and he has his mother and sister. As well as other details that are missing I still give it a 5 rate for its own kind of creativity.

sosasosasosa,The only good thing in this movie,01/10,30-Apr-18,"The only good thing in this movie: Ryuk still eat apples.
Honestly...
This movie is a waste of time. Watch to anime instead."
imbruces,Average,05/10,21-Sep-17,"The film has kind of nothing to do with the anime (+L is a African American), the film is not terrible because Margaret Qualley is so hot.I had to make a account to make this review because if you watched the anime you will find it kinda strange.Also Kira is a blonde guy, nothing to do with the original Kira."
redamc,It's inferior to the original but it wasn't a bad film,08/10,05-Jul-18,"Netflix's Death Note is actually a pretty great movie.Before the hate starts pouring in, hear me out on this one. Death Note, in its original form, is a story intended for teenagers. Though many of us who grew up reading the manga and watching the anime are now full-fledged adults, we may expect the stories we've experienced in the past to mature with us. Keeping in mind that this is not the case for Death Note or any other story we may have experienced in our younger years, let's start with the film's narrative.Though the initial premise of a mysterious notebook falling from the sky and a genius high school student discovering it remains largely the same, Netflix's adaptation of Death Note and the original story diverge from there. Characters like Light, L, Light's dad, Watari and Misa (or Mia) remain largely unchanged by name only, as each character's personality when compared from the film to the book are almost polar opposites of one another. Light actually breaks composure, Mia takes a stand for herself and L expresses, well, some kind of real human emotion.In this case, the film crafts a believable and interesting plot that's actually based somewhat in reality. Taking a page (see what I did there?) from the modern teen movie genre, the film feels like it presents a great introduction to an anime series that newer generations may not have heard of yet. Although sometimes falling for the tropes indication of the category like unexplained romance, strange motivations and over-the-top drama, this adaptation is fresh and new and a welcome change to what we're used to experiencing with the series.Death NoteCinematography, lighting, camera angles and music all aid to make the experience feel dark and brooding, but not to the point of making you want to cringe. There's a lot of action in this version of Death Note but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as the use of movement in the this case carries the dialogue and gives your eyes something to behold when they're not awing at the film's neon colors.Speaking of great things to look at, one aspect that almost all fans won't be disappointed to see is Ryuk, whose voice by Willem Dafoe is nothing short of genius. Every time the angel of death is on screen, one can't help to marvel at how chilling yet whimsical Dafoe's contribution is, a near carbon copy of what Ryuk would be in real life.There's a litany of other things that Death Note simply does well. Introducing a new rule to the book, having Ryuk interfere with Light's machinations, L wanting revenge, and the Kira phenomenon actually manifesting itself in the main story line add interesting dimensions to what fans didn't experience in the manga nor the anime.When it comes down to it, Netflix's Death Note is a great interpretation to an already great series. It doesn't serve as a true rendition of the original and it doesn't have to. When examined as an artistic piece on its own right, Death Note is a great film to watch purely for modern enjoyment - with a nod to the past thrown in."
snappybynight,A Real Abomination,01/10,28-Aug-17,"The title is rough. But unfortunately, that is an exactly what this movie deserves.Let's break this review in two parts, one concerning those who care about the soul of the original Japanese Manage & Series, and one concerning those who don't, and would just like to watch a movie that is fun to watch, and maybe a good time-killer.The sum of what I personally have to say remains the same for both parts: it's a truly bad attempt for a movie, especially a movie carrying the title Death Note.1) For the real fans of Death Note:This movie contradicts the essence of what Death Note portrays. There is absolutely nothing that respects the main elements previewed in the Manga or the original series, and absolutely nothing even remotely similar or familiar with them. Everything happening in this movie is far, far away from what really happens in Tsugumi Ohba's piece of art, and most importantly, the way and reasons things happen are also fundamentally looking the other way. This is enough for me to not even get into character development and the in-movie atmosphere as that's what Death Note is for true fans, a semi-realistic world that sets a chain of events between characters you get deeply connected to, and maintains a soulful link between good and evil, virtues and sin. The brilliance and emotion displayed in the original work is what we care about, and that's non-existent here.2) For those looking for a good movie:Character development is just off. I can not say I felt for any of the characters, nor did any of them interest me at all. For this movie, the actors just don't fit.There is no displayed proof of intention for any of the character's actions. The movie tries to justify why everything happens, but not only is the justification poor, it doesn't add up with what happens next.The movie is missing good or stable progression and key elements for immersion, as well as a lot of explanations of the why-where-when type.A lot of things happen out of the blue, and with no displayed reason. A lot of things are also up to very wide interpretation, leading to the even further weakening of viewer immersion.---I'll stop here and add this as a final comment for both:Watari's name is not Watari, and this is profoundly obvious. The moment Light put his name as-is on the Death Note I couldn't hold it but yell WHAT THE F***! I mean, I get a bad movie, but an insult to one's intelligence? The whole movie just gets ruined at this point, even if it was better this is where it just crumbles to pieces.And do you know what pisses me off? It's not the disrespect towards a wonderful Manga or TV Series for the sake of possible profit. It's the sheer reality that you fail re-producing a concept that is fairly easy to reproduce - everything is there in the series and books! Somebody that cared about the whole production, even if it was not following the original archetype, would have done a much, much better job.Watch the original series, not this movie. Even the older Japanese movies that didn't thrill me, are way, way better. Anime shouldn't be made into movies unless real passion is placed into."
srvjsrone,Do not watch!!,01/10,28-Aug-17,Nothing compared to the original anime series. Cant even say that it was a rip off cause almost everything was different. Its as if they tried to remaster it but messes up and that too in the worst possible way.DO NOT WATCH!!
labroskarantanas,High risk has two sides,02/10,28-Aug-17,"Everyone knows that taking a book, a series or a manga and creating a movie is extremely difficult. You need to make changes that will ultimately affect your story. So the decision to alter the story is justified. The basic problem here, is that we are talking about Death Note. An anime that is considered to be a masterpiece even from people that hate anime.I will point out two things.The first one is that, when you decide to take the risk of producing something so amazing as Death Note you have to understand that the expectations of the fans are really high.The second one is that even though altering the story line is OK, in this situation you have to respect some very important things. The most significant one is Yagami Ligth. I do not mean the color of his hair and his height. Yagami is a powerful character not because he has the death note but because he is a genius.He has Death note is just the element used to create this masterpiece. This change for me, is what made the change of the story line to completely fail. We are dealing with a completely new movie. If the anime did not exist i would say that it was a nice idea. But that's not the case here. I do not think that the original can be surpassed, but i am certain that with better analysis of the manga we could at least have an interesting movie."
lauraoltina,Disappointment compared to the original Death Note (anime),01/10,03-Sep-17,"First of all the characters were completely different. For example Light had different characteristics/personality to the one is the original series like he wasn't very smart with hiding the death note and also he should not have let the girl see where his death note is. The rules of the note were different to the ones in the anime and didn't make much sense also to add to that there was no second Kira or X Kira. Basically to summarise everything in one everything was very rushed, also with L he couldn't have figured everything out so quickly since in the anime he got help from Light. To add on top of that there was no point of naming the characters by their real names since they were nothing like them. I'm very disappointed.(Also the movie made no sense)"
dvdboezem,Go watch the Anime instead,01/10,28-Aug-17,"SO bad compared to the original (anime). I really wonder if the director and writers even watched the original, because the personalities of the main characters are definitely not the same. I'm really disappointed with the script and casting choices. I would HIGHLY recommend watching the original instead of this movie.

kristinpettigrew,Its NOTHING like the series,01/10,04-Sep-17,"I Kristin Pettigrew personally did not enjoy the 2017 Death Note movie due to its lack of comparison to the actual series. For one example the movie lacked actual rules of the Death note, and it also failed to show Misa Misa and her shinigami. Along with that the setting of the movie was in Seattle, instead of Japan. They changed Light's names from light yagami to Light Turner, and not that i mind but L was black and had a totally different background story. This movie was terrible. It did not follow the story line at all ! What was the point of making a movie ?!?!"
billyaxe-55621,worst remake ever,01/10,28-Aug-17,"why does Hollywood destroy all the Japanese anime by making a SH*T movie ? It kind of destroyed DEATH NOTE for me. The movie was so bad i wish i had the death note so i could right the name of people who made this movie.It has the worst actor possible, i don't know if the even did an audition or were just picked up from the street. Also has the worst CGI possible like a 90s movie. I just hope they don't try to make another anime movie

mohawmed,it isn't that bad,07/10,07-Oct-17,"6.5/10 if you watch this without basing everything you see on the anime it isn't so bad, most people hated it because how much this light is different from anime light and other characters in general also but you have to understand the only thing that is actually in common here is the death note. the movie and anime are 2 totally different things and if you know this before watching you'll enjoy it.

zenlock,Good adaptation that moves away from its roots,07/10,04-Sep-17,"Death note is a movie that didn't seek to copy the anime or manga as that has been done in a few Japanese made death note movies before.The writers chose to make improvements and changes that would make some characters more interesting like misa or Ryuk.The songs that play over the top of some scenes do occur too frequently although some of the songs do have a relevance as to the emotions of the characters in the scene,they still happen enough to get a little distracting like getting 2 songs come on a couple times while listening to iTunes on shuffle.Some scenes have great direction some of the highlights being Ryuk and some of L's If you're looking for an exact recreation of the original then you won't find it, but if your looking for a new perspective and version of this story then I'm positive that you'll enjoy it Just remember to keep your mind open"

dylan-83888,Takes out SO much,01/10,28-Aug-17,so much of the original anime is either taken out or changed. The acting was horrible and the scenes where light was screaming was like watching a try not to laugh video on YouTube. If they would have stayed with all the original story line and characters the movie would have been a hit.
aquacandar,Trailer was so repulsive I don't know why people bothered,01/10,04-Sep-17,"Honestly, I'm rating this a 1 ONLY because I cannot give it a zero. Reasons for this are as follows : 1. Contrary to what a lot of stupid people have been saying, fans of the anime/manga have every right to be angry at this adaptation which fails to be what it tries. The movie was ""supposed"" to be replicating the characters, plots and subplots in the original, going so far as to adopt the exact names as the original characters, not creating something new after being ""inspired"" by it.2. HENCE, fans of the original deserve to be upset after seeing the characters they had grown to love being butchered so relentlessly. A wimpy, unintelligent, wannabe psycho Light - an off-balance, uncharismatic, openly-giving-speeches detective - and the abomination that is supposed to be Amane Misa. Anyone who disagrees has clearly understood nothing about the original and can stick their hollow opinion somewhere else.3. The movie tries to compensate for it's shallowness with a gore-fest and teen angst(which apparently we hadn't had enough of in Twilight), which just goes to show what happens to a good story when a band of incompetent people try to replicate it."
morgantrobb,Utterly Confounding,01/10,29-Aug-17,"Did you ever watch the Death Note anime and think to yourself, ""I wish this show had more asinine plot devices and less interesting characters?"" Well, this is the movie for you!If you have not watched the anime series, please do so before watching this film. The series makes use of the same, very convenient and outlandish, premise. I did not enjoy the first episode particularly but was advised to stick with it. I was not disappointed.--THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS WHAT MAY BE CONSIDERED SPOILERS--Despite the regular trappings of anime, the series has a lot going for it. Light is an anti-hero set on an altruistic quest, possessing unimaginable power, and struggling with the growing corruption of megalomania. His vision of the future is justification for any action, regardless of transient moral evaluations. L is likewise possessed of an overdeveloped superego; governed by a very cold logic and a certainty of his own infallibility. For him, the law is the predicate of the argument and needs no justification itself. Their conflict is not only literal but ideological.This movie, on the other hand, has no characters at all. The hero is a blubbering emo teen without any discernible skills. You are told directly that Light is very intelligent, but he never actually does anything intelligent with the exception of a single scene towards the end. That scene, by the way, is absurd. He enlists the help of characters you've never seen and don't care about to perpetrate a farce that doesn't make sense. He has some vague idea about making the world better, but it's just some childish fantasy he stumbles into and sacrifices nothing to preserve.There is not any real ""dueling"" between the two characters. L, who is also an emo teen of some sort, pursues Light through a single, simple trail of evidence. I believe he makes a total of two inferences in the movie. There is no confusion about what is happening. When L confronts Light, Light confesses thoughtlessly and the plot is just over. The movie could have ended there and saved me around 40 minutes. The rest is a love story involving two characters who, if you're like me, make you want to throw up.I'm not even going to type a paragraph discussing the L origin subplot, to what extent it can be said to exist. Of all the things to tack on...In the end, you just don't care about anybody in this movie. If you do, I have no idea why."
rice_matthew,Just awful,03/10,29-Aug-17,"I have no history with the source material, so I went into this with no expectation. In the beginning, Light finds the Death Note (it literally falls from the sky with no explanation of why or where it came from). He meets Ryuk and is understandably freaked out, but thereafter is completely unimpressed. He just starts in killing bad guys. OK, I can believe that. But when his new girlfriend finds out, she is so sadistically into it, I thought it was obvious that she was going to turn out to be Ryuk in disguise ... but then she wasn't! So I'm supposed to believe a cheerleader with no screwed up background is willing to kill the bad and the good without remorse? Light just happened to fall for Charles Manson? And he just keeps forgiving her? WTF?! There were only 2 things that kept this from being a 1 review. First, L is an interesting character - I just wish they'd filled out his backstory more - he seems like he should have a series of his own. Second, Willem Dafoe is the perfect voice and face for Ryuk. Other than that, garbage."
AlaaGhost,I didn't imagine that I can hate a work even before watch it,01/10,09-Dec-17,"once I watch the trailer I felt shocked and disgusting because these 2 minutes of the trailer was enough to realize that this movie is a garbage and distorted version of the original manga/animeNat Wolff & Lakeith Stanfield not suitable for the role of Light Turner & L characters as the original manga/anime (smart, interesting, mysterious, have charisma ) especially, Nat Wolff, he is awful and doesn't have charisma and his facial expressions so silly (my advice for him: search for another career)my advice for you don't waste your time by watching this garbage and watch the anime, you will enjoy more

leezephora,the whole thing is so awful,02/10,29-Aug-17,"I am a fan of the Death Note, so when the Netflix first trailer come out I said to my self I want to watch it and give it a chance so I did. It was a huge mistake! If You're a die hard fan of the Desu Nôto (Death Note) don't watch it your just going to regret it.Here is the only thing they got it right Ryuk was voiced by Willem Dafoe and everything else is wrong! What's up with Light character? The focus is on Light's newfound power, not gruesome deaths! I don't get the character of Mia at all, am not saying she's dumb, Misa only punish the criminals. What I hate about more is L doesn't use gun! Okay maybe he punch Light in the anime but that was different.Seriously to who ever did this movie PLEASE WATCH THE ANIME OR AT LEAST READ THE MANGA!This is so frustrating am just going to take the potato and eat it!"

The scenes were terrible, the acting and actors were terrible. Light has never been so unappealing. You get to love the characters in Death Note even if they are doing bad you love them but never did i think i would dislike death note until this American version came out. Which is set in Seattle. Complete bore from the start.

reginachristella,Disappointed,02/10,06-Sep-17,I'm a big fan of Death Note manga & anime. I watched this movie & I feel so disappointed. It only adapt the basic idea of the original Death Note but the plot & characters are really different.Light supposed to be way more clever & never think about a girl. L also never be that dumb & emotional. The original Death Note is awesome because the story line & the main characters are genius & astonishing. But this movie has failed to show the core essence of Death Note.
eefkoenders,Okay movie if you don't know the anime version,03/10,09-Sep-17,"Here it is, a live-adaptation of Death Note. The movie itself is not bad if you don't know the original anime. If you do know the anime, this is nowhere near an adaptation. The thing that bothered me the most was how the characters were portrayed. It is like they have used polar opposites of the original characters. I understand that you don't and can't make a 100% accurate adaptation and want to do something different or even improve it, but come on. Light was a wimp, Misa a manipulative creature and L an impulsive childish brat. Even when L was facing death himself he remained his cool. The voice-actor of Ryuk was an amazing cast choice, it really suited the character. If you don't know the anime I believe you can enjoy this movie, but if you do, just be prepared to be disappointed. Side note: I really missed the potato chip scene."
abioticiv,Don't waste your time,01/10,29-Aug-17,"They could have done so much with the movie version of death note.Instead they butchered the hell out of important details and very poor actor selection the cast was awful as well as plot structure there was very small details that matched some part of the anime. Overall skip this movie and save yourself a cringe worthy""film"""
pricillalopezalvarado,yall are weebs,06/10,26-Aug-17,"yes it was different from the original and the actors were not Asian, even thought the author never specified the characters as Asian. Never the less it was an okay Americanized teen movie with the death note concept. If you want an exact adaptation from the anime go watch the shitty Japanese adaptations you weebs.

xxxlilalizexxx,Sorely Disappointed,02/10,29-Aug-17,"As a die-hard Death Note fan, I expected it to be at least half true to the original. No, they've taken a dark, psychological thriller and turned it into a melodramatic teenage drama. Light Yagami? Try Light Turner. Misa Amane the model? Try Mia the cheerleader. Light is supposed to be so intelligent that he's sociopathic. He's confident, fearless, calculating, organized, and calm. His character should have had good posture, squared shoulders, deep eyes with an intimidating stare, a strong jaw, and an air of arrogance. Misa is supposed to be a bouncy, charming, needy, ditsy blonde. The truest portrayal of a character was by the actor who played L. There was only one true-to-original interaction in the whole atrocity (Watari and Chief Yagami). It's like the director watched part of one of the last episodes of season 1 and decided ""oh, we'll take this scene and work around it."" It was so bad that I felt compelled to write this review. Those who have watched the original imagined this to be a live action adaptation. Instead it was a whole new, poorly thought out piece of non-fan fiction probably written by an 8 year old. The reason I give 2 stars instead of 1 is because the gore was OK and L's character was good. Overall: The characters have changed The story line has changed The time line has changed The genre has changed Why is it still being called Death Note? It's blatantly obvious that the majority loathes it. Your best hope of salvation is to burn this version and start entirely from scratch."
idaliljajensen,So far from the original it shouldn't even be qualified as a remake,01/10,15-Dec-17,"This was by far the worst movie I've watched this year. Everything about this was ridiculous, from the whitewashing to the completely rewritten characters to the horrible, exaggerated film techniques. They completely changed the characteristics of the original Light which made him such an interesting character. From being the coolest, most popular, best-looking and smartest student in Tokyo to this lame, emo, bullied, horny teenager is just not fair to the original manga. Watch this movie for the laughs, but don't expect any interesting storyline og characters as there were in the original.

themillybear,Worst thing I have ever seen,01/10,29-Aug-17,"This ""movie"" has nothing to do with Death Note. The only highlight is Willem DaFoe who simple can do no wrong and was made for the role of Ryuk. As for the storyline of the movie... Too much Final Destination has been watched for this one. Death Note is a mindgame, not a gore movie. Honestly... I am about to cancel my Netflix subscription for this piece of ****. What an insult to the manga and anime.

allykitkat-37247,Horrible. Didn't follow the original story-line. Waste of time.,03/10,29-Aug-17,"This movie is a disgrace to not only the Death Note fandom and original anime, but to the creators of Death Note. It doesn't follow the original story-line almost the whole time. First of all, ""Light Yagami's"" mother is still alive in the original, and he has a sister. Second, he's not a total loser in the original, in fact, he's one of the coolest students at his school in the anime. Also, ""Ryuk"" isn't a complete douche in the original. I still don't completely understand why they chose to film it in America when they could've been actually diverse and different than other film-makers and actually cast Asian characters rather than switch the cast to a different race. I do appreciate that they want to be different by casting a black guy as ""L"" rather than staying true to the story-line. Also, he never kills his classmate, ever. Honestly, Netflix, stop trying to be cool and realize you've made a horrible mistake in creating this movie. It is a mistake that this was ever created and it's a complete waste of time."
tpkmobile,Worst remake of an idea,01/10,29-Aug-17,"This is the first time I was so upset with a movie that I felt compelled to write about it.I love death note, its smart, calculated and a battle of two masterminds with the humans of the world as their pawns. Only separated by their ethics. Even this hardly does Death Note just. Even though I expected it not to do it just I decided to give the movie a chance and started it with an open mind. It increasingly became infuriating to watch. To see an idea be so misunderstood by someone...This is by far the worst adaptation I have ever seen about any movie. Both Kira and L are way too emotional and it ruins every attempt to like either. It was horrible to watch. Horrible. Horrible. The director of this movie and whoever else is responsible for allowing this to have made it past a School project should be ashamed for having denied others the chance to make a remake of the anime series for probably quite a while. It has so much potential but it was absolutely ruined by this waste of pixel space."
a-29126,Trash,01/10,09-Mar-20,Anime adaptations are always not good. This movie is not good because the deaths in this movie are like final destination type deaths they want you to think light is smart in this movie but he is dumb.
georgiahind,awful movie,01/10,15-Sep-17,"I'm a huge fan of the original anime series and I found this to be an insult to the original creator. Natt Wolff has been in paper towns and the fault in our stars, both amazing and interesting films. I wouldn't be surprised if his desision to star in this movie would ruin his career.The first thing wrong with it is the obvious: they changed the characters race. The second thing is that they basically changed the entire story line to make it better but in the real world made it worse. And there is obviously so many more reasons that it is absolutely awful. Its trash.This film is the worst thing netflix has made for a long time. This is breaking Netflixs streak of amazing films and TV shows.

theemosixx,Adaptation not re-reading!!,08/10,27-Aug-17,"The film has a very trash style, the first deaths presented were very well done, the initial personality of the 'Kira' is really good because he is an adolescent 'normal American'. The personality of the character L shows very unstable (so much that this leads to the end of the movie where he almost loses sanity). One of the weaknesses of the film is that Light is so submissive to Mia (even that makes sense because he is the typical loser who got the girl he likes and does not want to lose her). The character Mia shows the lack of coolness in Light and that is a positive point in the movie. One of the best parts of the film is the moment Light shows that he is not really a killer and tries to free Watari so that he does not die since he was not a bad person, even Watari dying from that moment Light realizes that using Death Note has many consequences and this is a point that is best approached (in a simpler way) than in the original work. The movie has an OK script, the cast of the movie could have been better cast but the actors did well (highlight Mia). What most sins in the film is the soundtrack that is weak. But other than that 8/10."
mzehraali,Wrong in so many ways,01/10,30-Aug-17,"this movies fails to show the smartness and intellect of both L and Light. Both characters are supposed to be confident and calm whereas in this dumb movie both seemed like afraid chickens.Movie missed out on many important parts of the story but they wasted 5 minutes of screen time in an unnecessary chase scene.Utterly disappointing...

You have a bunch of poor actors in the lead roles who don't fit the character. I knew this movie is going to be crap when L was a black dude. Its like casting Martin Luther King with an Irish guy. This movie's main audience is probably going to be a bunch of teenagers who has never heard of this anime, even then, they would hate the movie. I wasted close to two hours of my time.

anzboy,Garbage,01/10,17-Sep-17,"If you are about to read this comment to see if you should watch the movie just save yourself time look up the Japanese live action of it. They are both subbed for the best vocal quality and dubbed for easy listening. All the Japanese live action versions have better ratings and reviews.The director kept defending it as it's a ""new version"". It was not a ""new version"" a new version tells a new story or adds on to one that existed that makes sense like how the new Lorax movie wasn't just a retelling of the Lorax book. How Disney princesses have happy endings when the originals were darker. This ""new version"" was just a bunch of rewritten Hollywood movie clichés incorporated into a Japanese based story. You have the high school loser, the popular cheerleader, the loser's main enemy and how the loser will get on top in the end.Basically did not follow the mood of the story at all and messed up almost every character to make them more ""relatable"" to the audience and by ""relatable"" turn it into to some sappy teen love movie about a loser who gets picked on and somehow gets the hot girl that Hollywood people think all high schoolers are like with a twist he has a magic book that kills people. The reason why the manga/anime Light worked was because he was unrelatable as he becomes corrupted by the book from becoming a punisher of evil providing justice to a god that judges all, we don't exactly want a relatable psychopath. We never looked at Hannibal and go gee that is a guy I can relate too. If the original Light was seen as relatable god help us.Placing the setting in Seattle, Washington was a poor reason to whitewash the film. There was no use of the setting at all in the story to elevate the plot. There were no mentions of American politics that may had affected Light's views. There were limited references that they were in Seattle. The whole setting was irrelevant. It was just an excuse to cast white actors because the characters were clearly rewritten as White people because who thinks Light Yagami would be some white kid, so they changed his last name to Turner yet kept Light as his name, that was worse than when we were told Aang was pronounced wrong the whole time in the series and the movie had the right way. If they really wanted it to be good and white wash they should had owned it and do a Death Note inspired movie and not a complete rewrite of the original source."
vilimikkola,Americafied to the max,01/10,30-Aug-17,"An absolutely horrible interpretation of the original death note. Someone took this interesting idea, put it in a college environment with the characters being changed into juvenile drama queens. Ugh. None of the characters were acting like the ones in the original one, L for example isn't that impulsive, storming into Light's house and bringing the whole police department with him. Please Netflix, honor the originals, don't just try to milk money out of the fan base."
sewardofgondor,"This film has more in common with ""Heathers"" than its eighties aesthetic and psychopath-in-a-high-school plot.",06/10,02-Sep-17,"An aesthetic homage more in the lines of ""Heathers"" than what I can only surmise is a bastardization of the original. I must preface with an acknowledgment without shame of my ignorance as far as the original IP. This film suffers from two problems that must be acknowledged right off the bat: one social and the other technical. The first is of course, another shared trait of ""Heathers."" Both films retain a social ignorance of modern issues. ""Heathers"" likely gets a pass considering its issues were not relevant until a decade or so later with the columbine shootings. Still, one can't help but double take at the glorification of a student in a trench-coat attempting to blow up a school. ""Death Note,"" on the other hand, has no such excuse. It arises among countless other whitewashed Asian IP's including the atrocious ""Ghost in the Shell"" which have received just criticism, and to continue into the same regression is problematic, and as such I understand a lot of the backlash ""Death Note"" received. Saying that, It is important to separate what is problematic socially with what is artistically bankrupt, especially in today's binary, ""good or bad"" world. As far as technical problems, the film is far from perfect. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Willem Defoe's performance was phenomenal, as were the rest of the cast's. I mentioned before its likeness to ""Heathers"" but it exists more as a caricature of this. Most films which attempt to recreate the eighties modernly push the line of caricaturistic and that is often where they shine. Despite that, it is butting up against an anime and manga classic, the quality of which I honestly don't care about in terms of this review- like it or not. I can't say how it compares to its source, but I can't say I care either. ""Death Note"" stands on its own two legs well enough. I think this is important to understand, considering many films like ""Ghost in The Shell"" fail to do even that.From the start, I was won over by the soundtrack, striking color scheme, and of course, a truly terrifying Ryuk. My final rating was decided by weighing both the social and the technical. I must emphasize my willful and, from my perspective, justified disregard of the source material. As such, as a film independent of social realities, I would give it eight stars. To not consider the social reality, however, is far less justified than to do so with the IP. On this count, I detract no less than two stars from the original rating, leaving us at a 6. It's a eighties poppy drama that I couldn't help but enjoy, that is why I am even more spiteful that it failed to consider the repercussions of Americanizing yet another foreign IP. To whatever boardroom thought that was a good idea, f**k you."
royledgewood,okay if you don't know the source but crappy if you do,03/10,30-Aug-17,"I have problems with this. It might be because I know and enjoy the source material, but I think it was terrible. You're probably going to see an army of people saying that it wasn't close enough to the source and they are absolutely right. The writers took a great concept and characters I enjoyed and empathized with and turned them into generic stereotypes that I didn't care about. The parts of the source that were missing that really bothered me were:Light Yagami is a smart, popular, well liked, well off, and well rounded teenager with a good family who kills those he deems morally inferior (mostly criminals and those who come too close to finding him). He is also incredibly secretive of the note He is not a lonely homicidal nerd who kills every person who irks him. I cannot stress enough how angry this made me.Ryuk is not an instigator like he was portrayed to be. He is mainly an observer. He just dropped the note and followed it around. He did not urge anybody to kill upon their discovery of the note or encourage the passing off of the note like he did in the movie. He isn't supposed to be an antagonistMisa Amane (Mia in the movie) is a model/actress who was introduced as a Second Kira in the manga and fits the super-fan stereotype rather than the sporty chick she is portrayed as. Light doesn't view her as an equal so much as a tool in his crusade. She isn't a sadistic manipulator and she doesn't want the book for herselfL is a shut in who rarely goes outside of his room in whatever hotel he's staying at and works through an assistant or over a phone/laptop with heavy distortion of his voice. L does NOT go to crime scenes personally as that would increase the risk of his identity being discovered. Okay I'm a little nitpicky about this and I get why they changed some of that. Also he isn't really that much of an emotional person and some of his actions are out of character but understandableThe plot of the source material is only loosely used as a guideline and i am disappointed in the writers for trashing a good story."
ahnmaxwell,Painful to watch as a fan of the original,01/10,30-Aug-17,"Live action remakes of Japanese animations are infamously awful. Remakes in Japan follow the source material too closely, from over dramatic face close ups to cheesy lines that sound cringy in real life. Western remakes take way too many liberties, taking only the 'good ideas' and then ruining it with American clichés. I really hoped Netflix would have done better but I should have known from the moment I heard it was a movie instead of a series. They turned Light Yagami, an intelligent high school-er who grows to become a sociopath with a God complex into Light Turner, an emo high school-er who uses his new notebook to show off to his crush at school, never mind that he barely knows her. If you're a fan of the anime or manga, take any hopes you had for this movie, light it on fire, and watch them slowly burn away. Pretend this doesn't even exist. Trust me, life will be much more enjoyable that way."
badchecker,Complete Failure as an Adaptation,02/10,30-Aug-17,"Just seconding EVERYONES review. I'm yet another person that felt so compelled to write my first review due to how disappointing this was. It leaves behind everything that makes the Death Note cannon great and replaces it with dumb hollow teen romance. It's a movie that feels like it was made by the DW Network.Gave it two stars (instead of 1 star) only because, on it's surface, the concept is still there and it might lead new people into exploring the depth and true potential that Death Note has offered in the past.Terrible.Also, it's been mentioned but I don't think it's been mentioned enough. When a guys head basically explodes like a meat popsicle in the first 20 minutes, and then every death after that is a blood-gore explosion during the first 45 minutes, I immediately knew this project was in the wrong hands. Death Note is not about gore-porn scary bullshit. Clearly this director did not respect what he had placed in his hands. Just terrible."
helmanmendezm,Death Note Wanna Be,01/10,30-Aug-17,"0/10 didn't followed the original story and though their Ryuk was better looking than the Japanese movie,yet it was still off... Netflix would of done great. it sucked completely i was cringing the whole time of how awful it was. the acting was awful the worst i've seen in years. a simple name of Misa was even changed for no apparent reason to Mia.. Netflix made everything Americanized yet no one is named Light in the US. this film feels like its an indie film based on how low budget props looks.. the creepy looking iconic L sucks.. the actor even messed up L's sitting stance that he is known for. Ryuk voice was on point only reason why it deserves 1 point. it felt as if i was watching final destination but with mix feelings as if the movie didn't know what story line it was on.. if the creators of the original death note were OK with Netflix doing this film.. Netflix should of asked them if they can keep the original story line of the writers.. if this film was meant to be a different story line you guys should of done what happened after the end of the anime.."
destinystarrett,watched probably 8 times,10/10,13-Sep-18,"Okay so I know this movie is based off an anime, but I haven't watched it so maybe thats why I love it so much? there is a few things I would maybe change but honestly the only Netflix original movie I like, and I kinda fell in love with Light. I've recommended to so many friends and will continue to watch it over and over again!!!!

Haydius,On It's Own; Not Too Bad,05/10,09-Sep-17,"Having never seen any of the original film or prints, I am rating this movie purely on the movie itself.Although I enjoyed the film in general, I felt that it was quite linear and was ""too planned"". Quite predictable in some areas, it quickly lost the ability to make me feel anxious or intrigued.There seemed to be a few plot holes or just events that didn't quite line up right but overall it's not too bad.

As a fan of The original Death Note, I felt so bad for the anime and his makers.",01/10,08-Sep-17,"Only those who didn't watch The original Death Note, will consider this ""Trash Movie"" good and rate it beyond +2 . As one of the biggest fans of Death Note, i consider this movie a total humiliation to the Anime, what were they thinking making such a terrible mistake and choosing a VERY Realistic theme to picture and visualize a completely non-realistic plot ! When i was watching it, i felt no comparison what so ever to the Death Note anime in any pattern. Dialogue, fail- Acting, Big fail - visualization is total crap that made me think of the producer as a 10 years old child who was trying to make his favorite anime in a play for a school project ! Which turned to be a disgrace and an assault on the VERY special anime Death Note. I gave 1 for the effort of making a movie, but for the movie itself, again, Fail movie, just like trying to make an MMO like SAO, it made us all angry and sorry for the anime makers.

rcavitt-85588,Retcons everywhere!,01/10,26-Aug-17,"Horrible, just horrible. ""Whitewashing"" (aka a nonissue) aside this movie just takes the source material and spits all over it. Deathnote rules are changed up, for example you only have 2 days to control the victim, someone else touching the note doesn't let them see the Shinigami, and you can cancel a death by burning the page. Then on top of that Ryuk is just a complete f*cking d*ck, yeah he was a d*ck in the anime and manga too but at least he was likable. The last bit of icing on this horrible cake is everything is so mushed together it's horrible, yes I know you're compressing a 37 episode anime into a movie, but it's been done before, a lot better. You can roughly correlate some events in the movie to that in the anime but that is about it. The only two saving graces this movie has it Ryuk doesn't look like a CGI nightmare, and the note itself looks pretty cool, and that is literally it."
raydon-18211,Good movie for not watching the anime first,06/10,15-Mar-21,I'm an anime viewer and this movie is not as bad as these reviews are suggesting and I will be watching Death Note the anime series next but Im not gonna be comparing the two like comparing Dragon ball the movie and Dragon ball the anime series or Avator that movie and Avator the anime/cartoon because the anime cartoon series will always be better!!!

jalipoura,Whats wrong with the people of the internet?,07/10,02-Sep-17,"Many people went to the movie with the prejudice that it would be bad, but it was not. It was very entertaining even if L was shown a little bit badly you have to say that it is still an exciting movie. And just because you feel great, because you go with the crowd and say it's a bad movie, that's not automatically the truth. The second season and the end of Death Note wasn't that great either. This movie is only BASING on the anime and no direct filming, so you can't say it ruined the anime. For example, Ryuk is a very good personified character and even Light has his own personality. Be happy they don't just released a movie where Death Note is just in the title but it's just bad like Dragonball Z the movie. So freaking people of the Internet: STOP HATING!

But thats not the case with Death Note. I get that people are hurt that they change ""too much"" the story to make the films... ¿Do you know where the original source is based on? Thats right JAPAN, different culture, different people, different problems. There's no way to translate a full story based on JAPAN CULTURE to an American CULTURE without ""ruining"" the original source. Also, ¿how you put a 11 hour series into a 1 hour and 40 minutes films?There's no whitewashing on this films, you got diverse cultures on the films.

kyledavies-58449,Do not listen to most reviews,06/10,29-Aug-17,"The reason the summary is what it is, is because if you haven't seen the anime or read the manga, like myself then Death Note is by far not a bad movie, it has some interesting characters and a very interesting premise. Plus Willem Defoe. The acting in the first half is almost cringe worthy bad but if you can power through that it becomes a very entertaining watch. The ending was a little bit lackluster and that's the main reason that this isn't rated a little bit higher. All in all, I would definitely recommend a watch if you don't know about the source material"
pauldannerpmd,A cheap watered-down version of Heathers.,03/10,04-Sep-17,"While there are are certain moments that this film gets right, it misses the mark in far more places and ends up almost being a completely different story. It is no longer an intense game of cat and mouse between two geniuses with plot twists and jaw-dropping moments around every corner. It is now a cheap thriller about an angst ridden teen with temperament issues.

alecstokes,meant to be TV show,02/10,30-Oct-17,This was a heavily edited version of death note to make it more relevant to America so script was changed heavily and is practically a whole new storyline but with influence of the TV Show. Overall the plot was quickened to make it all fit in under two hours in what should have been about five to eight hours it should have beenThe Acting can seem a unneeded over done in some parts and provided me with some good laughs just out of over reaction over things. the actors did a good job other than that i loved the actor that played ryuk.Honestly id say its worth the watch if your a die hard death note fan but you would probably not like the adaption or wish it was a show like me

And I wont give a second star for that!So let's talk a little bit about Death Note. The original anime is classified as the most popular anime, and one of the top rated. Some of the contributing factors for that is the mind twisting story development, perfectly round characters, and magnificent direction. In terms of content, the show perfectly demonstrates a long duel between two of the greatest minds in the world, which you can never anticipate what's coming next, but as soon as it comes it all of a sudden makes perfect senseNow, this live action film...Extremely bad acting, no (yes, NO) story development, ridiculous direction, and even worse, retro 80's style music! I don't know who's Netflix f***ing with! Please excuse me for not being objective describing the facts, I'm in shock!I advise DN fans to sue franchise owner for selling the rights to such a disrespectful producers as Netflix!"

patman-11256,A disappointment after a hopeful watch,05/10,27-Aug-17,"After watching the anime years ago and seeing the trailer for this movie, it was clear that there would be major changes to the characters and plot. However, I decided to remain open minded and give this adaptation a chance, hoping for a different but exciting take on the original story. This movie should not be considered a disappointment because of its straying from the anime, but rather because it's absolute crap, even though the cast might leave you anticipating something great. I felt bad for actors like Willem Dafoe and Keith Stanfield as I watched Nat Wolff struggle to produce realistic emotion. The characters are underdeveloped, the dialogue is cliché, and the whole film was somehow both rushed and boringly empty. After an hour and 40 minutes of silly teenager murder shenanigans, separated by the dutch tilt (the apparent go-to transition for this movie), I feel generous in giving Death Note (2017) a 5/10."
kieron-78181,Review for someone who doesn't watch anime,05/10,27-Aug-17,"This movie is not for anime watchers, as you may read in previous comments, but honestly if you were expecting a masterpiece from a remake of Japanese anime, i am not sure what planet you live on.From someone who does not watch anime the movie is not bad but not Oscar winning performance either. The movie tone is a mash up of Dexter(serial killer with a conscience) and final destination (brutal yet complex death scenes), with a little twist of a typical crime investigation drama here and there.The plot moves along steadily enough to keep you entertained but you will be able to look at your phone for a moment or two for the less interesting scenes. All actors do there job well enough for a movie of this caliber, my main criticism is Willem Defoe character, he is mostly useless for any plot progression, simply there to explain rules which can just as easily been explained by the main character. Finally this is a average movie, good for a watch, better than ghost in a shell, but nothing to write home about either"
orsusrb,"An adaption with some issues, but overall is an interesting take on the source material.",07/10,28-Aug-17,"This movie is completely different from the source materials except for the use of the actual Death Note and the names of characters. If you are looking for a direct anime-to-movie adaption then this movie is not for you.However, this movie not being a direct adaption is not a bad thing. This movie puts a nice spin on the original source material when it is given to slightly different and in my opinion more human characters. Such more human tendencies is shown when Watari is taken from L, he freaks out and get angry, something that L never did in the anime but him doing it here makes him feel more human; this sort of happens with Light as well as he is shown to be extremely remorseful for many of the things that happen in this movie.The largest gripe I've seen about this movie is that Light is not a sociopath like he is in the manga nor is he as smart; these are two things that I can wholly accept when I thought about it as Light in the original anime had an incredibly supportive family and the Japanese schooling system actively promotes over-achieving, both of these combined made Light being so smart more believable. However, in this movie Light is parented by his dad who neglects him to an extent and also the US schooling system would most likely end up with him bullied for overachieving and this could explain why he is so unpopular at school. This also needs onto my next point, Mia (or Mikasa in the original anime). Mia is a popular cheerleader at school who pays Light some attention at the start and he fully opens up to her and runs towards her at any point he can, which is expected because of how much he craves attention, thus he puts up with the mass of terrible stuff Mia does to him through the movie (betraying him etc).However, these things to not excuse some of the things this movie does wrong. The main issues with this movie can be boiled down to three things; - The pacing - The editing - Minor inconsistenciesThe pacing has some large issues nearer the start where the whole community around Kira is created in a one minute montage, this could be fixed by simply making the whole movie be locally based in Seattle, where Light lives. The editing is at points completely off, such as unfitting music, weird camera angles and needless slow-motion (such as the final scene on the ferries wheel).Minor inconsistencies do plague this movie a couple times, some are so minor that they are not worth even mentioning but such ones as Watari's full name not being written in the book is a big one, but such things as Ryuk's name being written in the Death Note while he states nobody has been able to write it in it can be easily explained by stating that his name was written on the rules page, thus no killing effect. On the topic of Ryuk; the plot of him being untrustworthy is never finished and I'm presuming it was put there to throw the viewers off, but is was still left unfinished.Overall, this movie does have some large issues over it's span but it also has some really interesting ideas and themes intertwined within its plot and the creators did something completely new with the plot to which I must compliment."
kjellwillers,Went into it open-minded - disappointing,04/10,29-Aug-17,"As an avid reader of the Manga and watcher of the Anime Series I was looking forward to the cinema adaptation, hoping it wouldn't end like every other attempt. First of of all, IF YOU READ/WATCHED THE MANGA/ANIME and you're going in expecting a somewhat close adaptation to the original narrative, don't watch it. As you will be utterly disappointed.The first mistake probably was even attempting the impossible again, by cramping the series' whole plot into an 100 minute movie. Even taking that into account the movie still misses a lot of the important aspects of the Manga/Anime. The plot itself has only little to do with the original and even taking that aside has lots of holes. Failing to depict the characters properly with ""L"" the detective seemingly jumping to conclusions and other characters emulating the same unexplained reasonings. A lot of the tension is lost by failing to capture the intelligence and deductive prowess of both ""L"" and ""Kira"" the main character. Especially the café scene exemplifies that. Even without comparing it to the original scene which was one of the best in the Manga/Anime in my opinion. Another tremendous mistake was the addition of weird old school synthesizer rock destroying nearly every (good) scene.While being quite entertaining and well written the first half sticking quite close to the source material, it just spirals out of control with the end leaving me confused even after watching it several times. It's heartbreaking to think about what could've been looking at what it became.So if you really wanna watch it go ahead, but even when going in with low expectations and cutting it some slack I just got more and more upset knowing its potential."
cmarmo,My Death Note,01/10,29-Aug-17,"I would rather my name be in Death Note than to have watched that pile of trash. Better yet, I would write ""Death Note"" in my Death Note to spare others what I have just watched. Words cannot describe how terribly awful this movie was. So I'm not even going to try. However, I'll leave you with this, all involved with this production should probably look for a new line of work.

miche_lol-19121,Embarrassing Hollywood garbage,01/10,29-Aug-17,"Just another cheap Hollywood knockoff of a great show. It has, besides the premise, nothing to do with the original series. They changed the story of two geniuses playing an exciting cat-and-mouse type game, topping each other off trying to outsmart each other in a race to find out first the other one's identity, to a dumbed down, cheesy High school love story.The protagonist (Light) is originally portrayed as the smartest students in the country, a true genius with a bright outlook on his life. In the movie, he is just another bullied outsider with no character or real depth. The only hint at the original idea of a genius is that he does the homework of others for money, other than that he behaves like a complete idiot. Dumbing down something so essential is a shame. ""L"", the antagonist, was originally another genius such as Light, with a bit more edge and a lot weirder. This weirdness wasn't captured at all by the makers of the movie. However, because of their incompetence and lack of knowledge of why and how the Character works, made him into a cringy mess. It was just painful to look at the actor perform.The story was altered so much that it has nothing to do with the original. Worst of all: only the good parts where cut. Everyone who watched the original will just cringe into a gaping abyss. The original smartness is lost. Just a cheap, Americanized, dumbed down piece of garbage. Even as a standalone a bad piece."
avalos-23357,Don't Waste Your Time,01/10,29-Aug-17,"The WORST adaptation of a great anime. Obviously Adam Wingard has never watched Death Note. His main focus seemed to be on sex/relationships and not following the story line/character roles whatsoever. I dislike the fact that he made Light's character a wimp (politely put). It seems all Terrible directors use Sexual Content as a way to make up for their lack of skills in directing these days. Please for the love of god don't give this sorry POS good ratings.

marwanbassam,"This should not be called an adaptation, but rather an Indipendant Film",01/10,30-Aug-17,"This really breaks my heart. When I heard they were making a movie on DeathNote I immediately thought that it won't be great because the original anime series DeathNote couldn't be outdone. But i didn't lose hope, I had faith that this adaptation might be good and so i became excited and anxious. And then finally, it is released. I didn't mind the choice of actors but what about the original personalities!! Light and L are supposed to be very calm and rational. And the setting is just so ""american high school"". Very disappointed to the point where I now despise this adaptation. Waste of money!

mariamisfortune,just look at my username,01/10,25-Dec-17,"Sorry but compared to the anime this is an American trash movie. It's ok to change the plot a little bit in order to shorten the movie but the motives and personalities of the characters where completely changed. It just hurts to see Light being the winy teen he is in this movie while in the anime he strongly believes he is the god of a new world and what he does is indeed good for the world without a doubt. It was a bit like he changed roles with Misa (but anime Misa is still better than movie Light and anime Light is better than movie Misa ofc).
If you liked the psychological battle between Light and L consisting out of calm and intelligent decision making you will probably hate this film as much as I do because it's Americanized to a poorly directed, often seen, teen dramatic pursuit with inane characters.
To give you an impression how much it can hurt to see this as a Death Note fan: I wish they never made it, I wish we all could erase our memories about it and I only created an IMDb account to rate this movie so hopefully people stop doing this to good manga or anime stories...

earlhiggsboson,Every bit as stupid as the original,06/10,05-Sep-17,"I've seen all the anime and movies and this is really no worse than the others but wraps everything up in a single sitting. Death Note was a smart idea that never got over it's dull teen angst, repressed Japanese fury, 2D character development and lack of female players that mattered to actually get to grips with itself. This is the best way to consume Death Note so far. Hopefully one day they will let an adult have a go.

orangepastry,Major Disappointment,01/10,06-Sep-17,"This is the first time I felt compelled to write a review, because this movie makes me so angry!When I first watched the trailer, I knew it's going to be a bad adaptation. Usually when I watch a movie with a low expectation, the movie turns out to be a little better than what I expected. But that's not the case with this version of Death Note. Because it's way worse than what I expected. I am surprised this movie still got 4.6 rating (by September 2017) on IMDb. I feel like it should get lower rating than that. I rated it 1 star because I couldn't give it a 0!It's nothing like the original Death Note manga. They butchered the story by changing everything. They changed the portrayal of every beloved characters from the original Death Note. Light who's suppose to be a very calm and composed person, a straight A student whose dream is to create a better world, somebody who in the end was consumed by his ambition to be God for the ""new world"", a character that is beloved by many Death Note fan is portrayed as a coward in this version of Death Note. Plus the actor's poor acting makes it even worse (sorry). I really dislike his stupid portrayal of Light!L who's supposed to be another cool headed, calm and a genius character is portrayed as somebody who overacts too much.Seems like the people behind this production of Death Note did not have any idea why so many people love the original Death Note. Because if they did, they would not make it this way.I wonder how the original manga writer feels about this version of Death Note. In conclusion, don't waste your time watching it."

I find myself watching this so called Movie nothing even like the anime show. 20mins into the movie, my head what was the director even thinking, did he even read or watch the anime once? Anyways if there's a real Kira out there please write down the directors and actors name in the death note book 😀

tylergcclarke,Nowhere close to the anime,02/10,10-Sep-17,"This picture leaves out all of what was great about the manga and by proxy the original anime, this includes Light's entire mentality as well as his girlfriend's and even Ryuk's. The whole film feels off and like a very cheap knockoff. What made the original anime good was the lore set deep into Japanese culture whereas in this version nothing is said about where or what the death note is/ came from and also what Ryuk is. Without spoiling it the ending is also below par for what would be the midpoint of the anime as the film only takes up that part of the story. Overall I would recommend leaving this film well alone and watching the anime instead.

albanianwarrior,Hot Garbage,02/10,15-Sep-17,"The first mistake they made with this adaptation was making it a movie instead of a show. The 2nd mistake they made was f*cking everything up. If you are a fan of the anime/manga like myself DO NOT WATCH THIS PIECE OF HOT GARBAGE. The only reason I have given this a 2/10 instead of a 1/10 is because a small portion of the ending is somewhat true to the source material. When I saw the trailers I was expecting it to be bad but my word I never thought it would be THIS bad. Literally everything besides the small portion of the ending was done completely and utterly wrong.

pirateassthetic,Just take a moment.,06/10,22-Sep-17,"As a fan of the original anime, it took me a moment to adjust to the fact it was nothing like the anime at all, and that it was set in America with a bunch of white people. However, after I decided to take it at face value and as it's own, separate interpretation of the Death Note story, It really wasn't that bad. It was certainly vastly different and underwent many changes through it's conversion from a long and complicated show/manga to a 100 minute movie, but I don't think it's even that comparable to it's origins. You simply can't take a 26 episode show and compress it into a good movie with the same effect so I'm glad they did their own thing with with it. Don't get me wrong, it was far from perfect. The pacing was pretty off and the tone was a little all over the place but I believe the acting was decent, the colour pallet was pleasing and it still gave us some of that cleverness we want from Death Note, albeit on a much lower plain than the original battles of intellect between L and Light. Taking the movie more for what it was than what it wasn't, I believe it had fairly solid entertainment value. It's probably not for the die hard fans of the manga and anime, but when you look past the base material and accept it as its own piece of film, it's really not as bad as it's made out to be."
lolailololencio,Hollywood can't understand Japanese,02/10,07-Oct-17,"It could actually have been good if they just stayed with a completely new plot that had nothing to do with the original series. Instead, this movie tries to include its ideas and the original's ideas and mix them up, which results in a horrible cluster that makes no sense at all. I recommend you to watch the original series before watching this movie so you don't get a wrong idea of what Death Note is.

I loved the series for all its complexity, lovable characters and it's overall amazing plot. The movie was eh compared to the series. It had cool actions scenes, a nice plot,and I like the differences, but it was just okay. I just have to say this, if this is your first exposure to death note, please watch the anime. The anime is beautiful, and you'll get to see a new side to Light,Misa, L and the plot I think is better. Just try to watch the anime, you probably will like it.

It is beyond all my comprehension what these people have done to what used to be such an amazing piece of art that. The plot, the characters, the acting, everything was awful, perhaps except for the soundtrack.
It is really poorly directed and the changes that were made are major. Not the changes are what is bothering me, but how those affect the overall idea of Death Note and its major themes, really powerful philosophical conflicts and psychological ones have just been turned into some angsty teen that thinks it s fun to murder people. 
Absolutely disgusting.

ricardrev,Death Note for dummies,01/10,29-Jun-18,"This is the dumbed down version of Death Note. Death Note, the anime series is a masterpiece. This movie is an insult. The characters are completely different people from the originals, different personalities, and with that they threw away 90% of the story. The story in this movie is just based in the original, If they had done that to deliver something very good, fine. But no, this one is very cheap, some parts resemble more ""Final Destination"" than Death Note.
I was surprised to see that Netflix ended up providing a movie instead of a series. Wasted opportunity. Because there is already a (Japanese) movie with real life actors. So this was the opportunity for Netflix to do a series also with real life characters. Shame, because the Japanese movie is very good, even with a different ending than the anime, and a very good one. So we have a very good anime and a very good movie. Only Netflix had to come up with this trash.

alfierees,Not as bad as I thought it would be,05/10,15-Apr-19,"Seeing all the negative reviews I approach this film with very low expectations and I can honestly say that I was surprised because it was actually not that bad. Ok don't get me wrong the film wasn't really that good and it was awful compared with the anime and the way the director decided to do things in this remake was interesting and Willem Dafoe playing Ryuk and Lakeith Stanfield playing L was great. Overall this film was average but it's not one that I would recommend

corpsravi,Really Hollywood?,02/10,17-Apr-18,"OK so I have never been so disappointed in a movie.
1. Light TURNER. In both the anime and the manga, Light YAGAMI is shown as a genius, who remains calm and is able to counter his enemies (L and Near). In this adaptation (I'll call this movie DA (Deathnote Adaptation)), he is awful. He constantly reveals his identity, is scared to hell and back several times, and is just not interesting.2. L. OK I'll give props to the people involved for keeping the way L sits the same as the manga and anime. First off, L is boring. Second, he cries and the simplest of points. He is MEANT to be clever, and constantly on Light's tail, but he just seems so slow.3. Ryuk. I'll be honest. Ryuk was probably the best in terms of comparison to DA and the anime and manga. He could have been a little better (CGI for me was really bad... apparently they made him ""intentionally"" very plastic looking). But he did provide some humour and was an OK character. That alone spared me giving this movie a 1/10Now overall. There is way too much blood and gore. In the anime and manga, it's heart attacks to kill, almost a sort of calling card to show this was Kira (the alter ego of Light). However the use of different deaths made it so there was none of that. It just made it seem random and as though Light TURNER was thinking of the most gruesome ways.The worst part of the movie? Almost completely whitewashed (with the exception of L, who was black). Now just to be clear, I'm not racist. I don't mind white characters TO SOME EXTENT, in adaptations of manga and anime. But the complete change of the entire cast and location led to the movie feeling not it's true self, but an obvious fake.Also, WHY REMOVE LIGHT'S FEMALE FAMILY. There was simply no need to remove Sayu (Light's sister) and Light's mother (I can't remember her name). It made no sense, but the addition of those two characters could have allowed there to be some show of Light's a) kindness b) smarts (he helps Sayu with homework in the anime & manga).Finally the whole plot was just bad. It was dull, was nowhere near the anime & manga, and the ending (which I won't spoil), just meant the whole movie leading up to it was pointless. Lesson: Don't hollywood-ise anime/manga, because unless you have a plot that follows them, and good actors, it doesn't work."
liammandy-72494,The Only Name In This Death Note Is Its Own!,02/10,06-Oct-18,"If you are a fan of the anime then my main advise to you would be turn around and rewatch that, this is not for you.If your still not put of then watch at your own risk, the main problem the film has it straying too far fro the source. Every character in this film is so far from the character type they should be. it does not follow the story we all know and misses several important characters like Misa, Mello and Near.instead of watching this maybe spend your time doing something equally mind numbing like self lobotomizing!

andelerik,I made an account to tell you how bad this movie is,01/10,01-Jul-18,"Poor William Defoe. I did not believe how much of an insult this movie is until I've watched it. I kept telling myself - come on, it's just a different perspective on things, come on, it's new and... no.THIS IS A WORSE LOVE STORY THAN TWILIGHT. The worst movie I've ever seen. Only a teenager with a brain of a chicken may like this, ...wait, no I don't think anyone can actually like it.

ghostmage-04762,"Exchaning intellect for action, manipulation for love/sex. You have failed Netflix",01/10,17-Jul-18,"The original version was intellectually oriented (which is what made Death Note awesome and original in and of itself). But this americanized version seems more action oriented which, by doing so, makes more room for issues and not make it as enticing as the original (that being the manga, anime, live action japanese movies, and the drama.) This is much less composed than the original. You have changed the story line entirely.

michaeelryyan,Absolute garbage.,01/10,09-Aug-18,"I am an avid fan of the Death Note manga/anime series. This adaptation takes the series and COMPLETLY AND UTTERLY rips it apart into a storyline that barely resembles anything like the original. I couldn't make it past 20 minutes into this movie because of how cringy and disastrous Adam Wingard turned this storyline into. Not only are incredibly important details of the story completely thrown out, but entire plots and storylines are changed which made the original series so intelligent and intriguing. 
Adam Wingard should be put into the Death Note... death by boredom!!

hsegol-52411,Must have been a TV Series,01/10,18-Aug-18,"Animie was a master piece even though, last few episodes were not up to par.this one is really not worth watching, L Is the highlight of the anime, here L's character is a cry babySeems They dint have much time to explain whole story, they could have tried a TV series or they could have named it something else like blood note or kill note, I'm totally disappointed......

benmackie-05350,I hated this movie. I wouldn't recommend it!,01/10,26-Aug-18,"""This movie was horrible. The only thing keeping me from giving it 1 star is Ryuk."" Those were my thoughts before remembering Ryuk wasn't the same Shinigami he always was. Now I've voted it one star.This movie was horrible. They just changed everything for no apparent reason. Light is one stupid b**ch, they changed his surname to Turner, Misa is now Mia, she sucks, Light just wants to kill off anyone he wants, L cries at the drop of a hat, there's too much Gore and, like in any other movie, it had to be set in America. This list could go on forever, but I'll save you the haste of scrolling through everything."
francescobagatz,Bad,01/10,15-Nov-18,"Absolute garbage, an insult to the original. They completely changed the essence of the Death note, and removed good stuff, to add bad stuff.

lina_looney-38828,It's rather interesting for about 20 minutes,03/10,01-Jan-19,"The first 20 minutes is not bad. Quite engaging but definitely different from the original. Soon after Light told Mia about the book, I lost interest. Mia is his crush, I get it. But you barely know her and if the only way to attract her is to reveal your dark secret (that can be very much qualified as crime) you do you, americanized light!! She is practically stranger! I am big fan of the original death note. When I heard netflix made a version of it, I am excited but also rather sceptical. I just watched it after 1 year because many said it really far from expectation, it ruin their memories of death note, bla blabla.. But I watched it anyway and oh boy.. how they right!! Light I know is super intelligent and when only after 20 minutes into the film, he practically gave up his precius information for her.. meh.. Wasting my day off basically"
scbradshaw-75099,it's garbage,01/10,02-Oct-20,"The god complex that Yagami has in the anime seems to be almost non-existent in the adaptation. Also, wtf happened to L? L was created to be a pale, unique looking character, and they destroyed that by covering up his face all the time. If you went into this movie expecting trash, you won't be disappointed.
