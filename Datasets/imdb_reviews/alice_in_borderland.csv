sisubalan,"Great Season 2, Best Graphic and Faithful Ending",8/10,26 December 2022,"A manga or comic book adapted live action series. 2 seasons of 50 minutes to 1+hr series. Falls in action, adventure, horror, thriller, fantasy, scifi and family categories. Despite the family category, its not much of a family friendly series as it full with horrofic scenes for adults. Its about several groups of people stuck in limbo (a world between life and death), surviving every day in that world by participating in a death match to extend their stay until beating the leaders so that they can escape to the real world without knowing the reasons behind all the misery & losses.Season 1 was okay for me and not much of a fan since the storyline was not fully followed the manga/comic book. Meanwhile, season 2 was the best as it was faithful to the comic till the end. Although i felt it was rushed but the graphics and acting skills of the casts were tremendously improved since the previous season. Great audio and action scenes. New amazing line of casts and huge improvements on the previous main casts. Some parts were tearjerking, some games were exciting to be watched on bigger screen. Exceed my expectations, hence its one of my favorite show of the year 2022. Highly recommended."
secret_arash,Surprisingly Great!,9/10,29 December 2022,"This show is definitely among my 20 favorite shows, ever. It is exciting, it is fun, it is amusing, and it is full of emotions. The thing that I find stranger than the fact that so few people have watched it, is how low its ratings are. Honestly, people what more do you want?! The episodes ratings are so unfair. Each and everyone of them deserve much higher than this; especially the ending (if that is in fact the ending). Season 2 Finale was the best ending possible for the show. However, I do hope that they renew it for a third one because it has a lot of potential.Anyway, if you're looking for a 16-hour worth of time roller coaster that makes you stay awake for two days, Alice in Borderland is your answer.

tachiiderp,Probably the best anime/manga live adaptation I've seen,9/10,28 December 2022,"To be fair, it's not that big of a feat, especially considering Netflix produced Death Note and Cowboy Bebop, iconic stories in their own right, and failed miserably with them.But boy, they hit a home run with Alice in Borderland. The post-apocalyptic landscape of Japan looks incredible, the design and stage of each games are fantastic, and for the most part, the characters aren't all weirdos, *cough*, well a lot of them are but that's the charm, right?Now you can probably find a ton of plot holes with how some of the games went, and you will totally see this in many other reviews. But, just the sheer volume of so many types of survival games to be adapted was a delight to see.Not all games are equal in quality, but some really stands out, like most games that involves Chishiya and most of the games in season 1. All the games are absolutely brutal, whether it is a physical challenge, a mental challenge, or both. I was very surprised to see how some of the action scenes are done so well, like Usagi's parkour scenes, and probably the most memorable one that involves a katana.As far as the story goes, you're watching this and reading this review because you have some interest at least with the survival games genre like Saw and Battle Royale. Alice in Borderland mixes Battle Royale with a decent amount of wit and a bit more set of relatable characters. I even thought some character progression to be delightfully done even if they're simple and straight-forward.Alice in Borderland has gotten a lot of things right, and is probably the best anime/manga live adaptation right now. It certainly makes someone like me who has seen way too many terrible live adaptations of anime/manga interested to see if Netflix can hit another home run next time.* I would love to talk about the ending but this will not be a spoiler review. But I do appreciate the adaptation for faithfully adapting the ending (which I enjoyed, but it's certainly not everyone's cup of tea). *"
gazzalodi,Japanese Gut Punching,8/10,12 January 2021,"If you get tired of OP characters in non-existent peril with Netflix's US productions, this one will fix that for you. After we watched several episodes my son walked away shaking his head and said, ""I'm going to go read All Quiet on the Western Front"" to cheer myself up.It's pretty darn good. A couple of the games had some holes in them, and some of the character behaviors didn't make sense outside of it's what the writers wanted them to do at that moment. But really watching this is more about feeling like the last year wasn't so bad compared to what these characters are going through. Hoping Season 2 can keep pace.

thekhpro,I'm shocked and paralyzed by this tv show! SUPER ENORMOUSLY RECOMMENDED!,10/10,14 January 2023,"I wasn't waiting for this at all! Japan has always been known for 'inventing' technologies and others are just for 'plagiarising'. I do think that the same thing happened with this masterpiece. It didn't get the fame 'Squid Game' got which actually had reasonable motive to copy the fragments from the movie. After all, it's all about the power of the marketing. Simple excuse: 'the genre didn't appeal to all the audiences' But still, that's the best fantasy, mystery and thriller genre tv series I've ever watched so far. How hard the other competitors try to do better, It's the least likely that it will cease to be my bestie series of all time...

Tweekums,Impressive 'trapped-in-a-deadly-game' action,8/10,25 December 2020,"Arisu Ryohei is unemployed and spends most of his time playing video games. One day he meets up with two friends in the middle of Tokyo. After some mild hijinks they hide in a cubicle in a public lavatory... suddenly the lights go out and they can no longer hear the general hubbub of the busy city. They emerge to find the city empty. Not long afterwards signs lead them to a building, where they are joined by two girls. Here they are forced to play a deadly game, after which they are awarded a playing card. It emerges that they will be forced to take place in such games on a regular basis. Later we are introduced to Usagi, a skilled climber, who later joins up with Usagi. They gradually learn more about the games and what the cards signify while trying to discover if there is a way back to their previous lives.I really enjoyed this series; little time is wasted with set-up; the viewers are thrown into the action along with our protagonists. We know as little about the world they are in as they do and only learn more as they do. Early games make it clear just how dangerous this world is; just because a character is introduced early does not guarantee their survival. The scenes within the games are very tense, and frequently quite gory; there is also a fair amount of fan-service as characters wear beachwear in later episodes for reasons explained in the series. The way the dynamic between the characters changes is interesting; especially after our surviving protagonists find a location with many more players. The cast, both main and secondary does a solid job making the fantastical situation believable. The effects are mostly good but a couple of times the CGI is a bit obvious. As the final episode ends many questions are answered but more are raised; these people's problems clearly aren't over... hopefully there will be at least one more season.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles."
gyutaxx,Much better than Squid Game,10/10,27 October 2021,"It is a little long-drawn, like an anime, but thats the japanese production. It is much more exciting and entertainment than the Squid Game.It is undervalued compared to squid game.

andrewchristianjr,SEASON 1.,8/10,26 December 2022,"Deserves the hype that Squid Game later received. Unorthodox and unprepareable, often cruel, situations brought on by some god's sick sense of humour contrast with the good and bad of humanity which bring this series to life. Recommended.Synopsis:
An aimless gamer and his two friends find themselves in a parallel Tokyo, where they're forced to compete in a series of sadistic games to survive. It covers the Borderland Games' first phase with the arrival of the players and the completion of the Spot Card Games.An aimless gamer and his two friends find themselves in a parallel Tokyo, where they're forced to compete in a series of sadistic games to survive.

bscale,Season two is watchable but not as good as the first,7/10,23 December 2022,"The first season of Alice in Borderland is one of the most gruesome and exciting pieces of TV show. For me it is better than Squidgame even it has its flaws.I highly expected to see the sequel but after binge watching, it is still entertaining with higher budget for CG, more blockbuster actions, but it the end the story failed flat. It has nothing exciting anymore, the games seem easier than the first season.The ending is alright but along the way it becomes normal action TV show with very high budget. Anyway I recommended only the first season if you don't have much time.First 8/10
Second 6/10.

shanayneigh,Such a shame,6/10,29 September 2021,"This show started out great. There was a real sense of suspense and mystery. The images of an empty Tokyo, and especially the Shibuya scramble, looks outstanding. Save for some green screen fuzz in their hair, the environment looks absolutely real. The story in the first half is engaging and the acting quite good, with very little of the Japanese style overacting which is far too common.And then we get to the beach where the show falls flat right on its face. The show loses momentum and its mysterious appeal. The isolation in the first part of this show really worked in its favor, but once they get to the beach seemingly half of Tokyo has shown up there to party. The beach is riddled with bad actors, especially the guy with the assault rifle and the guy with face tattoos and a katana. Everything they do is so over the top. They have drama school rejects written all over them.Perhaps this is a very faithful adaptation of the manga. Supposedly the manga was inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, but I don't see how except in the most superficial sense in the form of a couple of the characters' names. If there is a second season I'll probably watch it, but if I said I'm dying to see it, that would be a lie.Edit: Well, season 2 was also stretched pretty thinly. It felt like we spent almost an eternity at the container park and the prison. But the ending was very beautiful, which was enough for me to raise my score by one star. I've read about the comic on which this show is based, and it seems like the characters, the antagonists in particular, are more fleshed out. Because I felt like they lacked motivation, especially considering the ending."
Mesina02,A great manga adaption,8/10,2 March 2023,"I'm quite impressed with how this show was able to instantly hook me from the first episode all the way to its last. This was such an entertaining watch and it kept on actively pulling something new out of the bag that I didn't see coming. The concept behind this show was what intrigued me and I was a bit curious to see how they were going to pull it off. Obviously the games they played were crucial to the story but what carries the series are its characters. These characters are what elevates this story and throughout the episodes, their journeys are as important as the plot itself.With the plot, it was exciting to see how the environment slowly began to affect the characters. In season one, the whole goal was to find out what this place was and who was behind all of it but then in the second season that's where they expand on that. It focuses more on the harsh reality they are confronted with and whether or not they choose to live with it.To me, this was a show I knew I was going to like and thank goodness I was right about that."
rdvljunk,Teenage fun,5/10,14 December 2020,"I have to admit that the show starts interesting, some teenagers move to an alternate universe where you have to play games in order to survive. It builds up to more complex games and even some of the initial main persons die in the games.But the moment the series move to the beach it becomes ridiculous and completely unbelievable. We have a huge group of good-looking teenage kids walking around in bikini/swim suits (so you can't hide guns...right), partying most of the times. What happend to all the older people they met before they went to the beach? Older people aren't able to find the beach?
The dialogues become really poor and flashbacks silly. Funny it to see that descent acting also drops with it and becomes really poor and some of the (bad) characters become silly stereotypes.To top it in the end-game while all others are simply shot when they object, Arisu just gets beaten up but keeps getting back with more silly arguments and waits with his revelation of the ""murderer"" till the last moment while wasting time on a silly discussion.So the shows starts fascinating, but looses it more and more towards the end...but I guess it will appeal to teenagers..."
amsterdamien,Loved it!,10/10,10 December 2020,"Beautifully crafted series. Never read the manga, so I can't comment on how faithful it is. But it has good acting and character development. The cinematography and set designs are beautiful. Good plot that kept me goed al the way through. If you like movies such as Battle Royale, you'll love this show.

ClockworkEye,Excellent concept,9/10,8 February 2023,"I loved this show so much that I binged the whole thing in just a few days.The concept is excellent and is almost like a show within a show as you are wondering who will die in the games, they do kill main characters you know, which really keeps you on your toes.Both seasons were as good as each other thought there is a lull at the beginning of season 2 but it's worth sticking with.The conclusion I thought was excellent and I was slightly worried how they going to explain everything and would come up with some far fetched reason for them being there but they did well with that.All in all very good and rounded up nicely which is something that Netflix fails to do most of the time."
javiergarcon,It is Unrealistic: Could not stop watching it,8/10,19 January 2021,"At first you would think it is cheesy but then you would look deep into your own soul and say... yep that is me, that is my neighbors, that is my colleagues, that is just like my boss that is just like my veteran friend, the characters really do a good job portraying its weaknesses and that is a sigh of relief, way too many make believe movies out there and this one helps to bring it home where reality meets fantasy. Now the fantasy part.... I do not know where to F&^cking start... good luck in figuring it all out because it is a complete mystery! Good for them because that is the golden calf of this show!

bigbadbassface,Suffers from exposition and plot holes,4/10,31 December 2020,"A really great idea that suffers from overly long scenes of monologuing and silence without purpose. There were plot holes and characters solving puzzles by connecting dots that made little sense. For the budget could have been great but as is was just decent.

Homer_Ate2,It's not that good,4/10,9 January 2021,"Until about half way it starts off all mature and exciting, I liked the tone and the characters. Albeit a little slow it had got off to a good start. Then the plot and acting became all childish (unnecessary yelling and crying, over the top sadism). The plot was not longer enjoyable as the focus was no longer any of the main characters as there were too many of them.

nightringer-76840,Welcome to Japanese Anime's World: The Adult Version,9/10,4 January 2023,"Alice in Borderland is an excellent example from the many survival game anime from Japan. Based on 2 seasons I have watched, this is a more dramatic, suspenseful, expansive and puzzling among rhe survival titles which got famous recently.It has drawn some inspiration from Gantz, Alice in Wonderland, Matrix, Sword Art Online, Btoom!, and more, literally. Interestingly enough, AiB is successful in unifying those inspiration into 1 coherent series.Arisu (Alice in Japanese) is the typical straight forward anime main hero, complete with self realization and guilt trip. The supporting casts develop the story well beyond the rest in this survival/other world/suspense/action/drama/scifi/.... series.Season 1 is very straight forward aurvival game.Season 2 is the character development and final game.There might be a season 3 or a movie as the sequel considering the last scene showed 1 final card that suspiciously unplayed throughout the series, The Joker card.For those who doesn't understand yet, Alice in Borderland is a much better survival game based series because it is brave enough to have a thoughtful end at season 2.I love this series."
bazookamouth-221-898097,"Halfway good, second half not so much",8/10,26 January 2021,"Episodes 1-4 terrific, Episodes 5-8 falls down. The probelm is the series changes after episode 4 where it was interesting to that point and then we end up in a beach community and it just goes pear shaped and makes little sense after that. The cards dont make sense either the numbers or the type. Whats the difference between a four of spades and a 8 of hearts? Sounds complex but when they are playing tag or hide and seek I cant relate to the cards anyway. Its nonsensical but still good for a part

harvmt,Interesting start usual flat finish,6/10,24 December 2020,As always with Japanese inspired manga and anime it's high concept that is sort of out the box or interesting which then gets worse as the series goes on . Much like Japan sinks 2020 they have a good start that inspires curiosity. As it gets further in the dialogue and decisions fall off to the ridiculous. E.g and office worker who will stop at nothing to survive but despite knowing what she must do opts to wear heels for games she might have to run in.. ok . But back to the rest the strange cult idea could be plausible but would people really act how they are or have the food to do it. Just odd decision making as usual. Much like the way sword art online goes from thriller esk scenario to odd plot lines that shouldn't have been there . Sadly I know they just keep producing this stuff
alaningle7,In the words of Gloria Gaynor,8/10,8 October 2021,"I will survive. An idle computer game fanatic suddenly finds himself with his friends in a deserted Tokyo where they must compete in dangerous games on a regular basis or die. It is a dystopian world where the game masters have no regard for life and push people into seeing how far they will sink to live. Well acted series with plenty of twists and turns and in a genre that the Japanese cinema excel in.

nneelakandan,A good start,6/10,20 December 2020,"I started watching after some reviews must say 3 episodes are really good and absolute thrill to watch if you are gamer it's for you. This series lost its thrill after 3rd episodes it becomes too slow in narrative (except few moments).

jbstjohn,"Starts well, but goes steadily downhill",3/10,6 February 2021,"I liked the glimpses into normal Japanese life it gives, and somehow the regular scenes of empty Tokyo were also cool. However, the acting (please close your mouth Asugi?), and the complete lack of consistency later on (once at the 'Beach') just get annoying, ruining any sense of mystery.Such as -- why doesn't anyone use the resources of an abandoned city? Canned food, comfortable houses, generators. Or weapons, which might occasionally come in handy. There's one 'game' where they manage to beat someone with a gun -- but they don't take the gun after they beat them, which might simplify things for the next fight.They also seem to have painted themselves into too much of a corner with power of the gamemasters. Lasers from the sky, phones in the lobby, essentially god-like abilities with no apparent limits or explanation. At the start it's okay as part of the mystery, but later it becomes too much. (Did someone take that tiger out of a cage? Bring it to that place, and then carefully let it go, after goading it to be hungry enough to attack? And then come collect it later).And it tries to be gritty and real, but then mixes in people punching out tigers and bopping about in bikinis in an apocalypse. Nice to look at, but made no sense. If you don't feel there's actually an interesting solution to the mystery, you lose interest in resolving it.I would have liked a bit more of an exploration. How can you maintain any power structure when you need to go randomly fight for your life every few days? Can those laser punch into the earth? If I'm in the basement underneath you, do you just get killed too? Instead you just get a bunch of over-dramatized yelling at each other. I guess it's supposed to be anime/manga, but it didn't work for me."
ks-60500,Good at first few ep,5/10,13 December 2020,"It's really exciting about the first few episodes, the idea is brilliant n sci fic fans surely will love it. But it's becoming quite likely the same for game play to survive....ehhhh patience needed.

slipstream3d,Good if you want to fall asleep then be startled awake by loud noises,4/10,8 July 2021,"Interesting concept. Extremely poor execution. You don't care about the characters (they're all annoying stereotypes), the acting is terrible, the English dubbing is terrible, the dialogue (English subtitles) is stilted, people don't act like actual human beings, and everything takes so long to happen. There's dozens of scenes just waiting, lingering on something we already know is going to happen - just get on with it!As the title of my review says, it's a great way to get bored to sleep then startled awake by random loud noises.

Misss25,Why so hyped?,5/10,30 June 2021,"This is like ""Maze Runner"". I am kind of disappointed as I had high hopes about this. It felt like watching getting killed in different ways. Okay,the male lead is okay with his awesome skills but no one can solve the puzzle except him. Why? Are these are too dumb? And the ending was really the worst thing that could happen. The leader kills everyone just because they influence his friend(the previous leader)!! Isn't it really funny? He killed his friend that doesn't matter at all but his friend was influenced and that got him killed in his own hands matters🤣."
joyjzhou,Interesting adaptation,7/10,11 December 2020,"As someone who's a big fan of the manga, I think the Netflix adaptation does a decent job for anyone trying to find more Alice in Borderland content. However, the devil is in the details, and except for the main story arcs, it's quite different from the original story.Many characters are introduced earlier than expected, and some games have changed concepts entirely. Certain story beats are shuffled around or erased. In addition, Arisu participates in several games that he wasn't part of originally. I would have to say to avid fans of the manga to watch this series pretending you have no prior knowledge unless you like to be disappointed. But by itself, it was spectacular to watch this interpretation of Alice in Borderland.

dseemalhar,"Decent second season, quite enjoyed it.",8/10,24 December 2022,"Binge watched season 2.Based on manga graphic novel,
This survival thriller drama has returned
with decent season 2 after 2 years.S2 picks up where S1 left off.Arisu and the gang continue to survive
in a dystopian world consisting
of death games and betrayal, and advances to next level of game.I really enjoyed this season more.It has Cleverly created thrilling games,
good character development,
quick transitions into flashback / back stories of character and present situation,
Good pacing except for last episode,
Easy cliffhangers, convenient plot development,
Good choreographed action n combat scenes
(specially in epi 7),
Decent performances,
Good editing, VFX n visuals.But it took too much time to reach the Climax.I'm happy with the ending.They kept one window open for next season.Over all, I enjoyed it.Total binge-worthy."
amaniam-34203,"Fun, but has many issues...",7/10,11 December 2020,"This show has a fun premise with great production. Some episodes are very strong and worth watching, but otherwise, the show is littered with poorly written characters that at times are acted out very stiffly. You can feel the actors going overboard or are poorly acting out a few too many scenes. The plot manages to hold interest but messes up small details that would often leave you face-palming or shaking your head.Overall, the show is a far cry from the 10/10 rating many reviews seem to be giving it... Think of it like a good way to mindlessly pass the time.

Zebra7,Fun drama great for binge watching but overall average.,6/10,12 December 2020,"The first few episodes felt fresh and exciting, but dipped in the middle and I kept hoping for the latter episodes to reach a climax and in parts it seemed like it was on the way there, but then kind of fell flat in the end.The plot itself isn't bad at all and definitely binge worthy, but can't rate higher than 6 because of terrible acting. Cringey and awkward all round. I've seen some of the actors in other films/dramas and I know they can do much better, so I assume the fault lies with the director himself.

mochteam,Feels like a live action anime,3/10,8 October 2021,I give it a 3/10The series feels like a live action anime. Some of the characters even seem like the usual anime tropes you'd find. Maybe if I hadn't seen Squid Game when it debuted I might have enjoyed this more but nothing beats the dark grittiness of Korean cinema...especially when it's executed so well.This show is much more in tune with the Japanese anime style of mixing action with drama back to back and throwing in over the top characters and ideas to keep things interesting. The show is probably more engaging for a younger audience than for others looking to get more substance.For me I found it a hard watch because the characters are very generic and the plot revolving around them playing games for days to avoid execution is less exciting than you would think for it to be. You find yourself not caring much for any of the characters at all because they're unrelatable. So far I've made it quite a bit into the series but I found myself losing more and more interests every episode. It's hard to be concerned about characters you don't care about in a series that requires you to care if the main characters live or die in order to enjoy it.
Reenoeh,LOOOOOOONG scenes,3/10,14 December 2020,"5 minutes just running, 3 minutes just thinking, 4 minutes just being quite and looking. Some of the games are fun others are just hide and seek with and without guns. MEH. It has potential just wish it wouldn't be so fxking slow. I skipped to the ending and you know.. it's kinda what you expect but nothing more. Season 2 - without me.

kjjames81,Not worth the 10 stars.,5/10,30 December 2020,"Okay the ten star ratings are a joke, the series itself wasn't bad but it had a lot of good and bad points.
Episode's 1 & 2 were really good.
Episode's 3 & 4 were slow and I nearly turned the series off.
Episode's 5 & 6 again were really good.
Episode's 7 & 8 were disappointing.
So really a series of hits and misses, I am glad it was only for 8 episodes otherwise it would have dragged on and on.
The cgi was laughable as we're some of the scenes such as the bus scene.
As for the scantily clad girls, have a meal.

stellansson,You will be disappointed,2/10,17 December 2020,"Nice idea, but the lousy dialogue and cringeworthy acting finally made me stop. I normally really like Japanese productions, but this was just bad and possibly the most overrated show in a while. Hopefully the rating will balance itself once more realistic ratings come in to counteract all the 10 clickers.So seriously don't waste your time.

AtlanticPirateK,This is something I haven't seen in a long time!!! UNIQUE!!,10/10,27 December 2022,"I loved this series incredibly, its story is amazingly woven that takes all the breath and gives you everything from excitement, action, drama and adventure.I fell in love with this series, and because of my admiration for it, I watched the two seasons in less than a week. It is wonderful without any argument. The directing, the acting, the story, everything is on another level of creativity.I just do not like sexual scenes or nudity in dramas or movies, and this is something that appeared several times in the first season, and exaggerated nudity male scenes in the second season, so caution is required.

aheyland-89052,The bad stuff outweights the good stuff. Still watched it...,5/10,25 December 2020,"It starts with a really interesting plot and also the characters are intriguing. The Japanese way of story telling is appealing although from a western perspective one is not used to it. Also the side topic of gender roles is fitting into it.Having said that the show delivers spectacular bad twists, character developments and acting. It's so weird to watch and painful but I really wanted to see the end of the show.Unforgettable the ridiculous fight against that cougar, the march back with bike all in the same time, the main characters always thoughtful games whereas others fight animals, the incapability of just killing this Aguni and so on... it's just so bad.Why did the girl revealed that she was the dealer? How did that help anybody? And then she died. Great job. And what about those cards. Where were they coming from and did they actually needed the cards? And why is everyone young and the girls always in bikinis?"

chiragrathod19,Alice In Borderland Skip It or Watch It?,8/10,8 February 2023,"Better than squid game?I said Yes! Alice in Borderland is an excellently delivered story. It is filled with memorable characters and gut-wrenching moments. Depressed gamer plays for survival in violent drama. In This series we witnessed thriller games and extreme violence.Season 1 : Starting is great upto 3 Episode after that story getting slow in some episodes but ending is good. Casting is also great. All characters past story ideas is good.Overall rating 7.5 out of 10.Season 2 : Better than season 1. Lavel of games is getting more difficult. Good to see game masters playing with player. Ending is more satisfying but their are some questions are unsolved, Not surprised if there is season 3 !Overall rating 8 out of 10."
royhectorkabanlit,One of 2020's Best Netflix Series,10/10,14 December 2020,"There are Series on Netflix that you have high hopes for or just seems good, but end up flat on their Faces when you finally watch it. On the other Hand, there are Series that you don't have a lot of expectations or know little about, but turn out to be a really big surprise.This is one of those Series, I literally knew nothing about it, I just tried it out and it turns out to be one of the best Series I have seen this Year. It is a Mystery-Action-Adventure-Thriller about a group of Friends who end up in a Place where they are forced to participate in Games that result in Life or Death.This Season the Series didn't really focus too much on the ""Why"" and ""How"" the People ended up where they are, it focused more on the Games themselves, and the Experiences, Group Dynamics and Background of the Participants.Each Game is unique and thus have to be solved in a relatively unique way also. The Pacing, Storytelling, Characterizations, Acting, etc. are all pretty good, there's not a lot of dull moments in the Episodes, there's always something interesting happening.It's just one of those Shows where, once you start watching, you just don't want to stop. Truly a Hidden Gem, it is a Japanese Production, not much Promotion, not much hype, hopefully it won't stay hidden for long. For Science Fiction Fans, this is a Must Watch for me, again one of the Best Series I have seen this Year."
anthonydapiii,Great Ebbs & Flows,8/10,16 December 2020,"I see the one in which the director and screenwriters made this show have that of an archetypal path.I loved its Hunger Games/Maze Runner type feel.The conplexity of the games to then have it looped it to mind games and personal character relationships was fascinating.Great watch - especially with friends.

Leofwine_draca,Real consistency,7/10,16 April 2021,"Review of Season One:ALICE IN BORDERLAND is a Japanese Netflix TV show based on a popular manga (as are so many). I'm just done watching the eight episodes of season one and I'm blown away by the quality of the series. It's very much like an updated BATTLE ROYALE, with a sudden apocalypse followed by incessant life-or-death games that our protagonists have to play through to earn playing cards. Imagine THE CRYSTAL MAZE but with killer lasers and arterial spray instead of Richard O'Brien waffling on about mumsey and you've got it. Excellent quality throughout and a great mix of plot, character, FX and action. What impressed me most is the consistency of this one, usually a show has some weaker episodes but I rated all of them 7/10 or above, so it gets a 9/10 overall from me. It really is that good and I'm eager for season two.Review of Season Two:Oh dear. Season 2 is a big let down and drop in quality from the first one. There are eight episodes and at least half are filler. Some of the action involving a guy marauding with armour is fun but hardly a 'game'. There are a couple of really good games here but most are rushed through too quickly. The last episode, which explains the whole plot from the beginning, is appalling. Average at best, this one."
hiepph,Japan did it again,8/10,13 December 2020,"This series is so Japanese (and so Tokyo-ish in particular). Characters are transported to another world suddenly, with no explanation. The story flows with all its strangeness and has an open ending (for season 2). The violence, tragedy, and darkness of the series always keep me on edge.
Perfect for binge-watching on the weekend.

Roma73,Would've rather rated it 0,1/10,10 October 2021,"Started off as a 6, then quickly sinks to 0.Teenage flick. Melodrama, cringing overacting, lousy scripting, uninteresting characters. I was still curious to see where this would take us but the acting and script bothered me so much I forwarded often. The story is similar to Squid Game, which I thought WAY better in comparison. Also, there was a lot of stuff I didn't think remotely credible. I don't mind absurdistic storylines if well executed but can't stand characters making ridiculously stupid choices. I've decided not to list them as to not have spoilers, but there were many.One minor ***spoiler alert *** though: the ""beach"" scenes seemed ridiculous to me, suddenly all sunhine, party and swarming with people (whereas until then the world was dark and the people very spare), with as the leading bad guy another cringingly overacted completely uninteresting character. Little puts me off like empty-headed antagonists. Then he dies and the next absurd psychos step in. That was the main problem with this series for me (next to a thin storyline and unimpressive acting): I didn't give a rat's ### about the characters."
TristanSilya,Way too much plot armor.,6/10,26 December 2022,"There's really a lot of things that can be talked about on the show but only a few things are worth talking about. First is the show relies too heavily on plot armor. Without spoiling anything many characters live way longer than they should, to the point where they almost feel immortal. That's just absolutely absurd.In general the show has some cool suspenseful scenes and some very cool effects. The characters are also pretty cool and eccentric. Sadly we don't get to really connect with most of them.Most of the games are also pretty underwhelming and random. There are a hand full that were pretty suspenseful and creative.The story in general is confusing. A few characters become way more likeable and get more backstory than Arisu, whom was actually kind of annoying and useless. But of course, it's his show so that's just how it is."
Stealthy-22960,What in the absolute world?,1/10,1 January 2023,"The fact this has such a high rating is baffling.The acting is the most atrocious and the voice-over actors makes it 100x worse. Netflix should invest in better voiceovers actors. I cringed so much by all the overly dramatic acting and monologues. All the yelling and screaming lines that weren't necessary. Even when the actor was just supposed to be silent, the voiceover actors was so dramatic with trying to make breathing so cartoonishly audible. Good lord don't let any woman get hurt or struggle, because all the moaning and breathing sounds like some porno or something. This would be 100x better if the acting and directing was more realistic like how normal people talk and behave. It was very cartoonish.Too bad because the concept of Saw, Hunger Games, Squid Games and even a little of TWD (backstory-esque and rotting bodies littered all over the place) meshed into one could have been a great thing... This series feels like a really bad parody of these.Season 1 was decent on concept, horrible on acting and flow. Season 2 is weak on believability, better on gameplay.I mean literally you have people surviving point blank gunshots to the head and still have the wherewithal to continue fighting and scheming to kill the King of Spades? You have this militant bad ass shooting up people and in the final scenes being whipped on my a scrawny teenager girls and women. I mean how many times does he have to shoot people in order for them to die? Not to mention all these main characters constantly able to dodge bullets as if they are moving at lightning speed. Military assault weapons that can penetrate car metal, somehow is unable to do so if the main characters were behind the cars. The extras all died hiding behind cars as the bullets go thru like butter. Just all cartoonish.The number of backstories was tiring because it would almost always interrupt the flow of what was going on and half the time it wouldn't even add anything important or substantial to the plot or character development. Backstories in general would be fine if done correctly... series like Lost or TWD are able to execute on this nicely, but hardly any series has yet to perfect integrate them.The characters weren't consistent from season to season or even episode to episode. For example the guy with the white/blond hair is this sneaky villain in season 1, who used Arisaw and his girlfriend as bait jeopardizing their lives. Season 2, he is this honorable former pediatric cardiovascular surgeon who prefers to operate on socioeconomic challenged children, and has a conscious and is out to save people.The one character who was a villain that got burnt the hell up at the Beach in season 1, not only survived being burnt alive but then becomes somewhat cooperative and reasonable in season 2 for a couple of episodes and then he's back to villain mode episodes later. There is zero explanation how he survived and what motivated all these different directions.Oh one girl was able to record selfies and videos in a subway on her smartphone, but supposedly no modern technology is supposed to work in this new world. One guy filmed himself and surroundings using a 3MM old school camera because of this. I guess consistency isn't this series strong suit.I could go on and on with so many instances of why this series failed, but I've ready wasted my time binge watching two seasons, hoping that it would get better. It did not."
mrfuzzydunlop,Had potential,5/10,15 October 2021,"As others have written, the first 4 episodes are great. There's a nice intimate, mysterious atmosphere. Then episode 5 completely destroys it as the show turns into an over the top anime basically, and never returns to the tone set in the first half.

Herufied,It's a mess,1/10,12 December 2020,"This was the most fantastic display of absolute and utter nonsense, that I've seen in a long while. It's hard to pick which was worse; the acting, the writing, the directing or the storyline - I believe in the end, it was a magical combination of total lack of talent in all areas, that made this cringe-fest so painfully entertaining to watch.It's like it was written by someone who's never witnessed human interaction before and performed by androids who lack the full programming to be able to pass as actual humans. The dialogues are so bizarre and the directing makes you scratch your head and wonder if the person in change is a toddler or a golden retriever, maybe. Nothing in this production makes any sense, and I'm amazed I managed to suffer through it all. It would absolutely blow my mind if this trash got renewed.

firefly900,Only for teens who haven't seen a lot of movies,1/10,23 December 2020,"So I got suckered in by the good rating. Read the reviews and you'll see there's a lot of people giving it 10 after watching 1 episode and saying proudly that they are doing that. Why do these dopes exist?
The 1st 2 episodes are good then it just goes down hill.
As it states it's a Netflix Original, so of course there's now an obligatory Trans person that also of course has to be a hero. I can guarantee you that's not in the original Anime.
But overall it's just boring.
Made up unimportant drama after the 1st 2 episodes give you 6 episodes of boring filler.
Don't waste your time.

mchan-29405,Forget the 10/10 ratings,3/10,30 December 2020,"Because those who rated this series 10/10 have only watched the first two or three episodes. Honestly, this would have been far better off if it had ended after the third episode, with Arisu heading into the unknown. It's almost like they hired a completely different scriptwriter for episodes 4-8.Seriously, save yourself 5 episodes' worth of time and don't watch beyond episode 3.3/10 for the first three episodes, and I'm being very generous for the third...

bchorost,So many plot holes,7/10,13 December 2020,"Seriously, I can't stand when there is a good premise that gets done wrong because of stupid plot holes. Spoiler alert. When the Beach game starts, it says there are 58 participants, yet there are WAY more than that, not just a few more, but considerably more people! They literally just had to change a number to make that hole disappear. I hated how the last few episodes played out. I was a firm supporter before the whole beach story started, but then it just snowballed into oblivion. I'm giving it a decent review just because I did enjoy the first few episodes and I don't want to deter people from watching."
thiagorbessa,It is good but it does not make sense.,6/10,22 December 2020,"The show in itself is good. It has good acting, scenario and all else but the story between the games does not make sense. They are in middle of Tokyo with a ton of canned food in every convenience store , there is empty houses all alround them and yet they are camping and hunt for food? Else for minor characters no one bother to bring a weapon when going to game, they make little to no preparation."
drpunkrock,5 for the decent first half or so,5/10,22 January 2021,"Well, the idea was very interesting and hooked me. Also the whole production looks pretty neat and was possibly made with a good budget. Already in the first episode you could unfortunately also see the problems of the show. The acting is so over-the-top at times that you cannot take it seriously. They completely ignore show-don't tell and over-explain every possible emotion that they are currently having. Then, with the beach plot, it goes off the rails. The characters become even more like caricatures, especially the evil ones. Probably for the teenage audience, the almost entirely young and hot members of the beach can only run around in bikinis. Then, the game in the beach makes everyone go completely crazy shooting everyone without asking why. You have flashbacks explaining why everyone is like they are now, which is sometimes hilarious. That dude sitting in his room all day becoming a sword fighter in a couple of weeks is as ridiculous as the dude being bullied and becoming a total psychopath. During the killing madness one former forensic scientist manages to find the time dissolving super glue and taking fingerprints of the ""murder""-victim (!) to prove the real perpetrator. How she was planning to take the prints of people running around hysterically I do not know. The only character that was interesting in this was the blonde calm and a little condescending dude. He had a lot of presence on screen and was acted very well. Well, maybe I wasn't the target audience. Good idea, less than mediocre execution unfortunately."
lipnusis,An Exciting Concept with Some Execution Flaws,6/10,13 June 2023,"Alice in Borderland is a Japanese science fiction thriller series that delves into the world of survival games and mind-bending challenges. While it presents an intriguing premise and manages to maintain an adrenaline-fueled pace throughout its episodes, the show falls short in a few areas, preventing it from reaching its full potential.One of the highlights of Alice in Borderland is its unique concept. The idea of being transported to a parallel version of Tokyo, where participants must compete in deadly games to stay alive, is undeniably captivating. The intense cat-and-mouse dynamics, the ever-present sense of danger, and the constant twists and turns keep viewers on the edge of their seats.Moreover, the production values of the series are commendable. The visually stunning depiction of the desolate and eerily beautiful alternate Tokyo effectively captures the unsettling atmosphere of the show. The action sequences are well choreographed, with plenty of suspenseful moments that heighten the overall tension.However, where Alice in Borderland stumbles is in its character development and pacing. While the protagonist, Arisu, is initially intriguing, his development becomes inconsistent and lacks depth as the series progresses. The supporting characters, while having their own distinctive traits, often feel underdeveloped and fail to evoke a strong emotional connection. This lack of investment in the characters makes it challenging to fully engage with the story on an emotional level.The pacing is another aspect that leaves room for improvement. At times, the series feels unnecessarily dragged out, with certain episodes feeling repetitive or prolonged. Some story arcs lose their momentum, leading to a sense of frustration as viewers eagerly await significant developments.Furthermore, the plot twists, while initially exciting, can become convoluted and confusing. The series relies heavily on these twists to keep the narrative engaging, but there are instances where they feel forced or overly complicated, detracting from the overall coherence of the storyline.Lastly, the series occasionally falls victim to predictable tropes and clichés, making it feel less original than it aspires to be. While it introduces fresh elements to the survival game genre, there are instances where the plot becomes formulaic, and certain character choices feel predictable.In conclusion, Alice in Borderland presents an intriguing and visually captivating concept that holds promise. The show's intense action, suspenseful atmosphere, and stunning production values are its strengths. However, the underdeveloped characters, pacing issues, and occasional reliance on predictable tropes prevent it from reaching the heights it could have achieved. Nonetheless, for fans of the survival game genre and those seeking an adrenaline rush, it still offers an entertaining watch, albeit with some flaws."
Littleman95,"Lot Of Action, Intriguing And Catchy",9/10,4 February 2021,"Plot: at the beginning it takes a while before it starts running but it is really good! It has quite a good pace and it's intriguing.Actors and Actress & Acting: well, I guess that everyone is quite used to watch American stuff, so watching something with Asian actors and actress will be a little strange at the beginning, but at the end they wont disappoint you so much.Soundtrack: particular but for this kind of show I think it is good!Conclusions: At the beginning you'll have to have some patience before it starts running. Then it takes its pace.
There are just few moments that will makes you wrinkle your nose for some behaviours or just for some absurd things, but in general is a very well done show, above of some others that are more famous then this one.

xylofonfisk,Second season is inferior to the first,6/10,6 January 2023,"First of all the first season was a fresh take on Alice in Wonderland, but once it all has settled the feeling of freshness become stale. The second season starts of pretty slow compared to first season and the game feels pretty lazy. What made the first season great was Arisus way of strategizing the games. Second season feels more like he just stumbled in and survived due to sheer luck. The final episode is dragging but the last fifteen minutes are very rewarding. That is actually the main problem with the second season it keeps on dragging. And the games are less intriguing than in first season. Two games stand out; solitary game and beauty contest. Both games feel more like games from the first season, the rest of the games are very lazy script writing.

stalkingvengeance,"Started off strong, but was I supposed to laugh this much?",5/10,5 January 2023,"The first season started off very strong. It was a compelling world, the characters felt real, and the concept of being thrown into a mysterious and deadly ""game world"" was pretty cool. The games themselves were hard to predict, the outcomes as well. I found that learning about what this world was all about, OUTSIDE of the games, was equally as interesting.But later in season 1 - SPOILERS - they reach ""The Beach."" EVERY character happens to be attractive, and it turns more into a teen drama with some violence... But ok, whatever, maybe it's going somewhere.Season 2 started off alright. Again, games that I couldn't predict, and a greater goal for the main characters to achieve. But it started to get a little silly at this point, as well.In the middle of some very tense moments, or when time was of the essence, characters were ALWAYS taking the time to spill their feelings to one another, or have some dramatic speech... These were very anime-like moments. And maybe that's what they were going for. I don't know. But I was constantly yelling ""SHOOT HIM,"" or ""STOP TALKING AND RUN."" It was getting annoying to listen to characters talk about their crushes while some guy is mowing down crowds of people on the other side of a car.I have one episode left. There's a chance the story could be redeemed (in my eyes) with this last episode. Hopefully. But I don't know. At this point i'm forcing myself through this, as i've made it this far.After the second to last episode, where I was dying of laughter at what was supposed to be an emotional fight (seriously, it's bad. And the solution to getting rid of the enemy is one of the most ridiculous in the show), I lost what faith I had left in this show. I shouldn't be laughing when a bunch of characters they went through the effort of introducing backstories to, are being killed... But the show has just dropped in terms of writing quality at this point. Oy.Anyways. It's not a ""bad"" show, but as with so many, it started off strong then just knocked itself over."
kowas_2,Is there a point???,4/10,7 October 2021,So after what one thinks might be a cool show with awesome plots and great reveals you find out nothing of value by the end of the series. There's no logic or why? Characters seem extremely mundane and really not that interesting! Feels like who ever wrote this was or is still in their teenage years. Where's the plot?? So bunch of young kinds just roam around Tokyo where everyone has disappeared to play in some game with no real reason or reward.I'm angry there was no plot. What's my reason of believing these characters are worth investing in? And the random throwbacks! If I want to even get more angry watch it dubbed!Overall not that good.
mrkmac,"Intriguing beginning, gets nonsensical at beach",5/10,23 December 2020,"This movie might be more for the gamer, manga, younger crowd if you want to stay glued for all episodes. I am with rdvljunk, and started losing patience and rolling my eyes with the beach activities. Plenty of beautiful Japanese women for those who appreciate that.

mealali,Let down of a good start,4/10,27 December 2020,"The first two episodes were fine. They can grap your attention. However, the rest is really confusing. They did not explain how they ended in this world and why they play the games.
The first 4-5 episodes were boring. You only watch people playing games. And then the catastrophy was the beach part. Really very bad. This is a great example of bad writing. The beach idea is really desperate.
The characters are not likeable and you can feel they are not real. The director insisting over and over that people are willing to sacrifice thier life for others are not real and become annoying.

rich7354,Childish doesn't begin to cover it,2/10,8 April 2022,"It's pretty obvious that this show is geared toward teens and pre-teens. The writing looks to be the product of a 10 year old. It's replete with mind numbing gore, scantily clad women, and over the top action. Mind you, I don't mind any of those things, when done well. Unfortunately, ""done well"" is not in the vocabularies of anyone associated with this project. I do have to admit, however, that I laughed many times at the moronic story and imbecilic plot. Also, the dialog was atrocious, but that could be due to poor translation.Edit 12/26/2022:
Not sure what possessed me to do it, but I watched season 2 hoping that things might have improved. After all, I enjoyed the premise of the series, as well as the individual episodes; the writers were just incapable of actually bringing their vision to life. It still has huge plot holes, stupid characters, and horribly boring and inane dialogue; but it was slightly better than season 1 ( I was going to raise my rating from two stars to three). But then we came to the big confrontation with the King of Spades. That episode has to be one of the worst TV episodes I've ever watched. They used every action/fight cliche imaginable, and not in a good way. People died, then they were alive again, then dead again. OMG, I almost ripped out every hair in my mostly bald head.Then to top it all off, they ended with a truly dreadful and mind numbing final episode. After that, I considered lowering my rating to a one, but decided I'd leave at two since not every episode sucked."

ana57709,Some reviews are to harsh on it,7/10,18 August 2021,"Let me start off by saying that the story indeed does have some plot holes, and there are definitely parts where you need to let some poorly worked out details slide to keep yourself hooked, but other than that I found it quite enjoyable.Sure, its a pity that such a good premise wasn't worked out to the fullest since the premise had so much potential in itself, but I do feel people are being to harsh on it. If you take the story for what it is (fantasy) than anything is possible, including the more unbelievable decisions made in the plot.

gokusama-27045,"Starts out good, then beach happens",5/10,6 September 2021,"The show's premise was actually good, if they had stuck with the same formula this could have been a lot better. Unfortunately, everything hit rock bottom with the inclusion of the bikini utopia. The plot became more ludicrous as we progressed through the beach arc. The show just randomly throws around flashbacks. There are these really sickening characters, the show wants you to sympathise with by showing their repressed past.Also stop making live action an exact copy of the manga or anime, there are some elements, that only work in anime. Including that in a live action only comes off as cheesy and cheap. This live action ticks all the boxes of the anime trope. What could have been a great survival show, ends up in the landfill of live action dumpster fire.

coles_notes,Below Average,4/10,7 June 2022,"This Japanese thriller about a group of contestants getting trapped into a games to the death kind of tournament is all the rage these days, so naturally thought I'd check this one out. It plays a lot more like a manga in its realism, mainly in that it does not strive for it. It's weird, most of the characters are superficial, and the premise is just baffling. Like most of these styles of thrillers it begins leaning into the ""community"" / ""relationships"" between the characters for the latter part of the season rather than the ""games"", and in my opinion only declines in quality. It's a show that thinks it's really clever and continually repeats how much it thinks it's clever over and over because it clearly thinks its audience is dumb. They aren't dumb, but this show is. Watch Squid Game instead, is much better.

joshfrench-98871,Extremely Better Than Squid Game!,10/10,1 January 2023,"This show deserves all the attention it can get. It is incredibly creative and gory and a great deal of love and drama thrown in there too. I've been a fan of Asian Survival Thriller Drama stuff since Battle Royal and in my opinion this is the best. Second season deserves awards. Perfect cliff hanger! Characters are incredibly good. Story is like if the Jigsaw killer from Saw was able to quarantine an entire city. I don't understand how Squid Game got more clout than this show. Alice in Borderland is almost a year older than Squid Game which is so much less creative than this show. I'm recommending to every.

PennyReviews,Good Enough,9/10,27 December 2020,"Japan seems to like the game theme, and "" Alice in Borderland "" nailed every aspect of it. From the suspense to the gore, the drama had it all. Fortunately, that all didn't include romance, at least not yet.Having not read the manga, and watching the drama with no prior experience of the Alice in Borderland universe, it wasn't hard to get introduced to the story and smoothly enter the gaming mode. The drama does a great job introducing each character and their background stories, blending them well with the main mystery about who's behind everything and the individual games the players were asks to play. The extra plotline with the 'Beach' and the strategies that the characters were ploting was another suspenseful factor that added a lot to the main entertainment of the drama.As for the performances, everyone did a great job with their characters and were enjoyable to watch. Some of the actors were acutally unrecognizable!Finally, the CGI were spot on and didn't ruin the whole experience.So, overall, 9 out of 10."
StuDeb2,Incredible.,10/10,12 February 2023,"What a ride this was watching it. It was brilliant from the minute it started to the final credits. It has so much in it. It's the best series I have seen in ages. The amazing cast are all great actors. The writing and direction superb. The visuals stunning. If I could give it a higher rating I would. We watched it on Netflix with the voices dubbed. Probably not as good as the original voices but it was done really well. I can't actually
big this up enough. It has emotional parts, gory parts, really sad and tender parts and mess with your head parts. It's nice to see as it has a lot of heart in it.

Tweetienator,Alice in Blablaland,4/10,24 December 2022,"If the first few episodes of season one are the best ones, than I don't want to know how weak the quality of the other episodes are. I tried the first two and a half episodes of season one but couldn't bring up the will to watch the show any further - there is simply nothing interesting going on that I did not watch already, and better made. The acting is not terrible, but the English dubbing is. I guess the show is more suited to a young audience but if you are beyond your twenties you won't related to any of the characters. The story is also everything but new (as far as I can tell) - a melting of ideas like Cube, Lost and so on but without the suspense, thrill and news. The action is rather generic too. Anyway, production is okay, and I guess if you like to read manga and are heavy into modern Asian movie making you may like this one more than I do. Last word, Squid Games hit me on the right spot and is in my opinion by way superior to Alice in Borderland.

danybaron,Total disaster.,1/10,30 January 2021,"1st episode I'd give 7/10.
Cool idea, acting was quite ok and I was motivated to see more. Not many effects but everything was well made.2nd episode was a 6/10.
Quite ok and a good watch.3rd episode was a 5/10 and it already became boring and acting became worse. Also the game made no sense. My hopes that you could survive by being smart or anything (John Kramer, Jigsaw) got destroyed. In most games people must die without any reason.4-8 episodes were all 0/10.
Writing was a mess.
Acting was terrible. Really.
CGI was terrible.
Effects and physics were terrible.
And it made no sense and had nothing to do with the first episode.Overall a big disappointment and not worth watching. Trust me.Also the last 3 episodes were sooooo bad, I couldn't believe it. Nothing made sense."
shivum1,"Good premise, good suspense, too much plot armor",5/10,5 January 2023,"This show is really well thought out. It is a unique idea and an interesting concept. The viewer is left in suspense for the majority of it as we aren't sure what is going on. However the plot armor is wayyyy too thick on the main characters. There are multiple instances where there is no chance that the main characters would survive but somehow they do for no good reason. Many of the choices that people make are very obviously out of character when it comes to not killing the main character.This could have been a 9 or 10 but due to the poor writing and abundance of plot armor, this show gets a 7 from me.Season 2 would get a 2/10 if I could rate it individually because no enemy makes sensible decisions and every main character can escape death by just running while everyone else around them dies using the same strategy. It is so horrible I am sorry I ever invested time into this show."
tazulmasud,"Really, this is underrated web series.",10/10,24 February 2023,"Alice in Borderland is an underrated web series that offers a refreshing take on the survival game genre. The show is based on the Japanese manga of the same name and follows the story of a group of friends who find themselves transported to a parallel world where they must compete in deadly games to survive.One of the most impressive aspects of the show is its production quality. The cinematography is stunning, with each scene carefully crafted to create an immersive and thrilling experience for the audience. The use of lighting and sound is particularly effective in building tension and suspense throughout the series.The acting in Alice in Borderland is also noteworthy. The cast delivers compelling performances that bring depth and nuance to their characters, making them more than just mere archetypes in a survival game. Kento Yamazaki, in particular, shines in the lead role of Arisu, bringing a vulnerability and relatability to a character who could easily have become a one-dimensional action hero.The pacing of the series is also well-balanced, with each episode delivering new twists and turns that keep the audience engaged and invested in the story. The show manages to avoid falling into predictable patterns, constantly subverting expectations and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.Despite its many strengths, Alice in Borderland remains an underrated gem that deserves more attention than it has received. The series offers a fresh and exciting take on a well-worn genre, with strong performances, stunning visuals, and a gripping storyline that will keep you hooked from beginning to end.Overall, Alice in Borderland is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys survival games or dystopian fiction. Its combination of high-quality production, strong acting, and thrilling storyline make it one of the most underrated web series out there."
joao_ryder,Painfully cringy acting,4/10,19 December 2020,"The people in this show act like manga characters, it doesn't work with real people. Too many clichés, one example is games being solved at the last possible second. A guy punches a tiger and somehow is the winner in that exchange.

Cheapthrilluser,Season 1 okay Season 2 Nay,6/10,11 January 2023,"Writing review after watching Season 2. I love the game strategy and curious how each game ends.Inspite of all the logic holes in the whole plot, I could binge watch this series until season 2.I didn't care when the main characters died. Boy oh boy, after all the gunshots, they are all still alive. I guess death is slow for main characters in this world. During the checkmate game when they got just 5 minutes they had a loooonnggg talk to convince to join in blue team. In reality, I wouldn't do that. Come on, there is no hope you will survive in the next game, there is no guarantee that you will get back to your world, why will I take risk? I am not trained to face death. The protagonist is not strong one. In fact, nobody plays the game with the plan. Everyone is just ready to play and sometimes figure out the game so easily. Anyway I would still watch season 3 as long as it is not like Episode 7 in Season 2 which is when I started to lose patience to watch.This is watchable if you fast forward the conversation and flashback and focus on the game execution."
velvet-nightmares,"Interesting first season, terrible second season",4/10,30 January 2023,"Having finished both seasons 1 and 2, I must say I am extremely conflicted when it comes to recommending this series. There are some mild spoilers for this review, but I will try to keep most of it vague.Most of the stars are for season 1, which had great physical and mind games that the characters needed to survive in order to move onto the next level as they try to figure out what's going on. If you enjoy Battle Royale/Liar Game/Hunger Games/Squid Game etc, season 1 is a pretty safe bet as long as you are okay with some of the usual manga tropes. However, unless you have a lot of spare time on your hands, I would not recommend continuing with the second season.Season 2 is so ridiculous and badly paced that it drained a lot of the goodwill that I had for this series. There's only one prison game that was satisfying to watch (IIRC episodes 3-4 if you want to catch that one).The rest of the time it felt like a bad action movie where the main characters should have been killed in multiple instances but by some miracle live. (For example, people being in horrible car accidents without seat belts on and getting away unscathed, or being stabbed and shot multiple times in what should have been fatal wounds, but then most of them don't die from their injuries.)
As a result, I was bored by everything that had to do with the King of Spades since the setup for that game is just so stupid, and I fast forwarded most of the scenes with Arisu and Usagi because the romance felt very stilted while the scenes dragged on forever.The final answer as to why they are in Borderlands and what actually happened on that day is meh, and it drives me crazy that they broke their own internal rule for how Borderlands is supposed to function by bringing back a character who died there.Taking both S1 and S2 together, this series was pretty disappointing. At times it also reminded me of the weakness of manga adaptations, because characters and scenes that work in manga don't necessarily work in the live action format. Overall I would say watch season 1, then catch episodes 3-4 in season 2. The rest can be skipped."

Fantastic sound , video , camera , photography , acting all just get a 10 , the story just different level , enjoyed every episode., I think the word is going through these kind of feelings and emotions and sometimes it make sense to take a step back to think which world is actually real , it reflected a lot on my own personal view of my own surroundings , I also loved the directing so much and the show truly put so much effort in the videography and actresses are just amazingly beautiful loved every and each one of them , I had to even hear the real sound in Japanese.

fjames-46456,Easy Binge,10/10,19 March 2023,"I actually had to watch this twice to get certain things. I couldn't understand how they ended up in a building with no one else around until they started playing the game. Season 2 gives a little more insight and I know for sure it will be a S3, if not I'd be surprised. This series starts out with 4 friends hanging out but everyone disappears. The weird thing that wasn't explained was if they were in fact in another world/ realm that made them stuck in the game. S2 ends with them given a choice to continue, which gives another chance to kill each other or go back to normal. The games consists of all of the card suits and the games are determined by which card was presented. For example, if a 4 of hearts was pulled, they would potentially have to kill their friend, The hearts face card is the hardest for most. Great weekend binge."
anansoliman,Waaay much better than squid game!!,9/10,28 December 2022,"The series was really well made , and actors are really nice , had alot of fun watching it , and the second half of the second season is just so good ! , And i am happy that i saw development in season two more than season one, this series in my opinion is really underrated and the end is unexpected, and i am glad that in the end there is a glimpse of hope about having a third season , really can't wait for it !! When you compare it to the squid game series you will feel the huge gab in the maturity of the idea and script writing
In squid game the idea is just so basic and we get it from the first episode and it's just so ordinary!!!But alice in border land is just in another level ! More mature , way mote energetic, and makes you at least thinking about what the end might be and raises questions, also the ideas discussed in Alice is way much better than in squid game,
Highly recommended to watch !"
hussaincheema,This makes squid games look like a 5/10,10/10,24 December 2022,"I've just finished the second season and feel compelled to write a review. I am absolutely blown away with every aspect of this show. From character development, metaphors and the most jaw dropping plot line. I never saw it coming in a million years!In season 2, it's just FILLED with action, thrill and just the most gripping storyline. I don't think I've seen a series like this that tied everything so perfectly. This is a masterpiece and my hats off to the creators, the actors and producers. What a series.I only ever leave reviews if I feel a show deserves it. I just had to write something. Thank you for giving the world this gift.

gnokial-59688,Mindless Great Japanese Torture Game Show,1/10,2 January 2021,"Expecting some exciting mystical stories in the ultra-modern backdrop from the Land of the Rising Sun, I did not expect this to be just another series of the old but well known Japanese torture game show. The only difference being now equipped with smartphones and hi-tech gadgets. The fact that the people in the show aren't really tortured like they were in the reality shows, a lack of logic or any coherent plot line, are the reasons it failed to hold my attention beyond 3 episodes. So it was an early sayonara for me.

peter-laganis,Could have been a much more intelligent show,7/10,12 January 2021,"The first episode is indeed very gripping and introduces a hope.
The hope that the next episodes will be an escalating display of clever riddles and conclusions. A hope so strong that the viewer is willing to accept the mediocre acting.Unfortunately the show doesn't choose this path. Instead we are fed with b-movie action and thriller sequences till the very end of the first season.
Furthermore we are left with a feeling that nothing really happened ... besides the first 3 episodes.In conclusion: A good concept, with some great atmosphere, ruined by a wrong script path and bad acting.

nodlimax,"Entertaining, but far from perfect",6/10,17 December 2020,"Alice in Borderland is a story about people being thrown into death games and they obviously try to survive. The concept is not very original and also has been seen in quite a few anime shows as well.Depending on how it is done it can either be pretty entertaining or very dull. When you know that a lot of character may or will die then it often is difficult to build any attachment to them because they might be gone in the next episode.So far in season one the show has done a decent job at least regarding the main characters - one of them being Arisu. By the end of the first season I did somewhat care about him and want him to survive. Usagi as a character is also very likable.Unfortunately for the side characters it's a lot of hit and misses - so resembles a bit of a rollercoaster. Some are decent/good and some you'll forget within the next 10 seconds.The games that are shown are interesting for the most part. Some of them could use better twists though.My biggest gripe is the ""power"" inconsistency though. We're having characters that for example supposedly have been bullied in school because of how weak they were and that don't look physically strong and then suddenly they pull off something completely inhuman like doing a backhand fist slap and through that throwing another character several meter away from them.Also the show tries to provide backstories for the various bad characters to explain why they are the way they are. However it's hard to feel sympathy for someone being punched in the face when said person a minute earlier randomly murdered people and has a great time with that.I'd like to see where the story goes in season 2 and hope they can fix certain problems. Overall it's okay to watch it once. Most probably won't return to re-watch it later though."

backup-50362,A solid Japanese show to watch if you want a break from American woke cringe,1/10,11 October 2021,"Man, you see the Netflix logo and you expect the same predictable garbage you see in every other Netflix show but wow, this ain't it. It's quite special.Clearly not as high-budget as Squid Games, it's obvious it's mostly filmed on a green screen, but the characters - the gang - I loved it almost from the beginning. Too bad everything I loved is gone in episode three. I haven't watched the rest but I'm already sad that the chemistry I got invested in was offed so quickly.My only real gripe is that some scenes are very slow sometimes, as if trying to grasp for that 1-hour mark. And since Japanese culture is so different, a lot of moments and meanings are lost in translation and don't make much sense.In any case, that doesn't ruin the show, it is super enjoyable to binge watch.And unlike Squid Games, the English voice acting is actually quite good. Kinda like watching Final Fantasy dubbed.Definitely watch this. Avoid everything else Netflix is peddling to you and watch it.Values like friendship, honor, sacrifice, support even from strangers, you'll never see that in American Netflix-made garbage. That's why you need to watch this. To restore your faith in humanity at least a little bit."
divemabini,"Finally, an ending that works!!!!",9/10,4 January 2023,"This is an on-going beef I have with Korean fantasy shows. The writers don't know how to close out good ideas and get the ball across the goal line. AiB proves that they can still learn a thing or two from manga-adaption Japanese writers.Don't get me wrong, I love Korean shows, but this one is just soooo much better from start to finish (especially finish) that it blows Glitch, Sisyphus, Signal, etc. Out of the water.I'm taking off 1 star for the King of Spades battles, which are yet another example that NE Asia writers don't understand how guns or counter-assault tactics work. Probably because they aren't exposed to guns (or gun violence) on a regular basis, which when you come down to it, is a good thing, I guess. But the totally wrong mechanics of these battles does cause you to groan a bit.But the rest of the show is nearly flawless, with an engrossing story line that is well-paced, great acting, predicaments that are emotional and gut-wrenching, and unanticipated twists and turns. Though with some of the games you can very early on guess as to how they will turn out. Still, no Deus ex machina god-like moments to spoil the fun, and no easy-button solutions that plague the Korean shows.A great show that is well worth watching. In fact, I'm going to go out and explore some of the source material. It's that good!"

denuwan-27382,potential future for live action manga adaptations,9/10,12 December 2020,"Oh man, this is nuts, probably the best tv show I've watched in 2020. when I first heard about this series I was excited and also worried. Because in past most manga or anime adaptations were so bad. After watching 1st episode my mind was clear and I know this series going to be epic. Director Sato Shinsuke excellently brought this manga into the real world. The plot is like the mix of hunger games and escape room but Alice in Borderland is much more than those two. In hunger games they just kill each other for survival, escape room there are different games but limited to a building. But in here we have games + open world. it's good if There were more backstory for the character I was interested in. About the acting our protagonist Ryohei Arisu act by Yamazaki Kento he was great in this series, the way he expresses feelings is so natural. I am very impressed with the supporting cast they did an excellent job. There were few uses of CGI and they are good. About Cinematography I loved it, in an episode there two battels in those battels the way they use slow-motion effect is great. This hard R rated show full of valance and blood. I highly recommend this show to watch. Then have a nice ride with Alice in Borderland."
skyescape-564-683302,Ruined show,3/10,13 January 2023,"The series was destroyed in the second season! I think the seventh episode of the second season is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. Such stupidity is hard to come up with and then do... you have to be very ""talented"" for something like that. I don't think even the Terminator would survive what a living man survived in the seventh episode. Only Rambo could fight a thousand enemies with a slingshot and destroy them all :) I will never understand who writes such idiotic scenarios...
In the third season, we can hope for a new twist, for example: animals that talk or have martial arts, why not include aliens with advanced technologies, just to see how people would manage in such an environment. The idea has a lot, just so that the ""experts"" who write such ""genius"" scenarios do not fail :)

figmar,Absolutely Outstanding,10/10,27 February 2023,"If you can get through season 1 episode 3 without crying your eyes out, you are dead inside. This show is so well done. I wanted it to go on forever. However they did a great job of wrapping things up so if it does end with season 2, I will be happy. They have a great cast and a great story. This is one of those shows that makes me grateful we have streaming services that allow us to peek inside other cultures. This kept me entertained through all two seasons. I binge watched it in one 3-day weekend. I absolutely did not want to stop. That is very unusual for me. This show kept my attention completely. I am amazed at how well done this was.

lisamaiwood,Boring,2/10,17 October 2021,"I really don't understand all the good reviews. The first few episodes were OK. But then it goes downhill very rapidly. People saying it's better than squid game clearly don't understand why squid game has such a wide appeal.The characters aren't likeable, most of the actors cannot act, and they have most of the females characters running around in bikinis, so I guess that's why some types of people like it.Could barely finish watching it.

seb-juenemann,Maybe enjoyable if you're able to turn your brain entirely off,3/10,11 January 2021,"The setting is what is to be expected from a manga and I need to admit that this the best part of this show, it's interesting and kind of fresh. But that's it already.Anything after episode 2 doesn't make any sense at all. And it's not that the protagonists magically wake up in a strange real world computer game adaptation, this setting offers so many possibilities, yet the show fails everywhere.Any human interaction is totally unbelievable, the decisions they make are totally unrealistic, the dialogues are wooden and off set, the acting is poor, no character development. Also the whole way the story unfolds is so unrealistic, so many plot holes, contradictions, that if you are a slightest of a rational person you will constantly stay in disbelieve and think <<Why, Why, Why ...>>.

davidcbabsthurgarland,Just gets soooo stupid,4/10,8 October 2021,"The four stars I've given this reflects the number of episodes that are watchable. It begins quite reasonably. We're invested in the characters, tensions are built and the mystery surrounding the game is the main drawing point of the entire show. But as the series progresses it gets increasingly dumb. The writing is plain lazy. It treats the audience as if we're stupid. The writer's are having to bend over backwards in order to 'connect the dots' re the plot..and it just doesn't work. It's just lazy writing. And basic. The 'revelations' are just basic, no other word for it. A cigar smoking chimp on a type writer spits out better scripts than this. I literally laughed out loud at each plot point that gets revealed in the final few episodes.Once the reveals are made you obviously look back at the actions of the characters in the prior episodes, piecing together the puzzle of how we arrived at the point we have...and none of it is plausible. Well... plausible isn't the right word. It's just.. here's that word again..basic. I was so disappointed with this show. Three or four reasonable episodes doesn't constitute a series worth watching. Just watch ""Squid Game"" if you wanna see how a series is written an executed properly. This was a waste of time in the end."

nicklaus-463-394773,Season 2 is an 11,10/10,28 December 2022,"Season 2 is a gut punching, soul stirring rollercoaster of a ride down some dystopian rabbit hole. It lets up every now and again only so you can catch your breath and calm down enough to build some affinity with what you realise are just everyday heroes and heroins. What would you do yourself when faced with some extreme scenarios? Everyone comes from behind time and again and from their other lives too to discover what they might not have even been searching for. Love. Friendship. Self-preservation. Dignity. Honour. Its all there written into the plot and infused repeatedly through games without hope. They've really taken this second season and dialled it up to 11. Riveting.

indiana1981,Highly entertaining!,9/10,15 October 2021,"If you've watched Squid Game, personally I thought this was much better. The games take place in a variety of locations and generally the show is a little bit more darker...The end of the season gets a little OTT on the storyline, but I thought it's well made. And I believe the reason for the existence of the games, is a bit more creative that Squid Games.Lower budget, but more entertaining personally.

kidmiracleman,Cringey Acting,5/10,20 December 2020,"I love animes and mangas but i hate bad adaptations. I don't understand why, when they make these series they are forcing themselves to copy %100 to look like a manga character. Their movements and mimics can't be same exactly like the drawings and yet they try to act like that and it makes everything cringey. If you like the story try reading the manga it is much better.

andydrake101,Absolutely brilliant,10/10,1 March 2023,"Dark, Last of Us, Watchmen, Battlestar Galactica (2nd ver)...etc etc...some TV is just pretty much perfect and it's such a pleasure when it happens. Alice in Borderland surges to the top 5 in my list by combining incredible action, amazing heart, profound story, memorable characters, unrelenting hope, stirring music, and I guess on top of all that something special so that it is more than the sum of its parts. I'll treasure it.I'm not quite sure why some people are scoring it lower but perhaps it is because it has hope and emotion and people sometimes prefer grimdark to be, well, grim and dark. But life isn't like that, and thankfully TV doesn't have to be like that too.

markjamesedgar,Tiresome and slow.....,4/10,3 January 2023,"Having enjoyed the squid game, I thought I'd give this a go. Other than seeing a completely empty Tokyo devoid of any people this show has little to offer anybody over the age of thirty. The acting is awful, the characters draw no sympathy and it is mind numbingly slow. The dubbing is American so it seems even more stupid to a British audience. I wish I had a quid for every time someone said ""we've got no choice"" or ""this must end now"". Each episode is a rehash of the last . It came as quite a relief when two the main characters got killed off at the end of episode three. If you enjoy gratuitous blood shed half naked extras and fisticuffs, this is the show for you. If you find character development and plot mechanics important, then I suggest you avoid it."
wildchangeofheart,"C R I N G E. If don't care about bad acting and stupid decisions, then watch it, it could be fun",4/10,25 December 2022,"Omg I really REALLY tried to enjoy it. Looking for silver linings. The premise is fun, kind of cliché but fun. Really poor acting, I don't know if every Japanese TV shows are like this? I don't think so. I waited for something kind of theatrical, but not cringy. Also, it is full of plot holes. Why the main characters who is kind of a genius at the first episode, after many episodes he doesn't show the same skills? Like he forgot everything he knew. The behavior of the characters, or development is not consistent. They make decisions that nobody would in the real world (maybe they are not addressing realism, but still it kind of loses points of fun cause it's not relatable to).It just doesn't make any sense. "" let's play this game that we know nothing about of without discussing what to do, let's everyone do whatever you think is best OK? A plan? Who needs a plan?""And the direction. Pleeeease director stop with the dramatic pauses for dramatic purposes which make no effect at all!!! That resource turns the scenes longer and more boring..."

Snownoise,It wasn't that bad but have some problems. Overly complicated games is one of them.,4/10,17 November 2021,"The show has a very strong start at a fast pace with an unique approach of the genre. One can't really ask more than that. But then, all the premises fall very soon by changing the style of the story too soon. Basically, from episode 1 to episode 3 is Season 1, and the rest is Season 2. The biggest problem I've had is that the ""games"" are often too complicated which makes me confused rather than being engaged in the activities and feeling the suspense. The best example is the games in SAW series. The games are simple but deadly. It's all about the execution. There's only one way and you know how to win the game. Of course they differentiated the games in this show by making them more like sophisticated puzzles, but then again were they trying to show up their writing skills, or let people enjoy the show? Ever since, Death Note released, a similar troupe has been introduced in many media in Japan. At this moment they just want to show up their intelligence. ""Look, how smart we are."" Okay, I get it, but don't you want to use your intelligence to make the show more enjoyable like Seinfeld? Even though the show has a nice stylish setting, but it doesn't live up to it because again their focus is making the show look smart. Also there too many behind the stories of minor characters. Oh, by the way, where are the older people in this show?"
chrisforeman-01920,Surprised by the high rating,6/10,14 January 2023,"First of all I am clearly not the demograph this is aimed at, so my sceptical view of the score is probably not surprising. Ok so its not terrible but its not that good either.The problem start with the acting, which isn't great, add onto that the dubbing and you get that weird double whammy which instantly turns it into a parody of itself.The first 3 episodes are actually fun to watch its pacey, mysterious and the scenes of an empty Tokyo are great. The we get to the Beach and from there the whole thing quickly unravels into a bit of a mess.Some of the survival games have rather large holes in them and some characters just react in utterly unconvincing manner.This is certainly no Squid Games which produced an awful lot of cult scenes and iconography. AiB has none of these. So its watchable nonsense a bit long at 8 episodes, if you go in with a low benchmark you wont be disappointed."
Littlesummer14,Love the fact that they follow and respect the source material!!,10/10,23 December 2022,"I love the manga and read it all
Then when netflix made the series i was afraid they would change it into some political nonsense .. am glad they didnt.Tbh, i like the manga better than the series, however the manga has 60-+ chapters and the series only has 2 seasons. The characters in the series are bit less deep compare to the manga but again, it's acceptable. The ending in manga makes more sense than in the series but i still like it.Again, i cant stress enough that i am glad it respects the source material and not turn it into drag** ball Z disaster.Recommended. Should watch it and also should read the manga. If you live survival theme, u'll love it!

markwha,Overall quite good but lacks in key areas,8/10,29 October 2021,"There's no question that this is a very good series for fans of this genre but it also unquestionably falls short in some key areas that prevent it from being a 8.5+. Right away, you'll get that nice feeling of familiarity because you've probably watched the likes of Saw, Battle Royal, Cube or maybe you've just finished watching Squid games and are now open to the idea of fighting through subtitles and horrible dubs in search of older but watchable material from foreign entities.What we have here with Alice In Borderland is a fresh take on the classic survival scheme at the hands of a mysterious and largely unknown force. The acting is superb, casting is spot on and the story is healthy, but man oh man did they ever miss an opportunity with the death scenes!Time and time again you'll see the same 3 things play out while expecting something more to give you that same shock and awe that you got the first time you watched Cube or maybe one of the Saw movies. Here you do have a lot more dramatic tension and better acting but the effects and demise of characters is blatantly unimaginative. That'll not only does this. Quickly become repetitious, but it also causes things to get rather predictable.If there's a season 2 (and I suspect there will be) if they're able to turn pump the gore and effects to match other current shows such as The Boys, Brand New Cherry Flavour, and some of the classics that I previously mentioned, they should be able to add that extra Umph, really shock the audiences, then we will have a timeless classic.Still worth watching though, and I should give them credit for adding more of an element of mystery which seems to have been lost up until episode 6 at least."
orandle-35127,It's a mess,1/10,7 January 2021,"Defy logic and bad acting. The first few episodes are fine, but it goes down to drain as the show goes on.

jimwt66,Loved S1...S2 was OK...S2E8 disliked,6/10,31 December 2022,"I am not sure if they are going to make a season 3 but if they end it here IMO they ruined a good show. This is just like Squid Game but Squid Game the characters seemed to be more ""intellectual"". I don't mean intellectual as in figuring out the games but Squid Games seemed to be more into figuring out what was going on while Alice was simply focused on figuring out how to win the game so they can return oh and as a far distant goal...Figuring out why this happened.I can see why they didn't put more effort into figuring out where they were and if this was real or whatever. The ending was a big let down if it ends with S2. I can only hope that there is a S3 and we find that the ending of S2 was just one more mind game of what was happening to them. The ending doesn't make sense and makes me believe it is not real. We find out that a meteor exploded and sent all these characters to the hospital but yet they all seem to have the same ""dream"" and at least a few of them kind of remember each other. So they need a S3 to let us know what really happened. In the last episode the one woman who was thought to be running things tells the characters a few stories about what has happened to them. Of course each story is something that the viewers has thought might be the reasons. Aliens, VR, bored rich people betting etc. I personally was leaning towards the tv show ""Lost"" and this was purgatory since almost all of them had bad things in their past. A few it wasn't clear they did things to go to purgatory but we don't know everything about them.Anyway, if this goes to a S3 and has a believable reason on what is going on then I will come back and move this up to an 8. Squid Games was a little disappointing in the end also but it left room to excel if it came with a S3. So I am hoping this will too.Unlike some I don't mind the poor dubbing. I find reading the text more of a distraction then the dubbing. I don't watch their lips so I don't notice the words do not match the mouth movements.As for the characters making dumb decisions...Well, if everyone made smart decisions then the show would end real fast. Plus, how many people you know that you could see doing dumb stuff.I don't know what the point of having the characters decide if they would stay or go. We saw the people who said they would leave were in the hospital but I don't remember seeing anyone who said they would stay in the hospital. Hopefully that is addressed in S3. But then you have to wonder how long will the characters keep participating if they find out that there is no real end."
CRMas0n,Interesting concept. Poorly executed.,6/10,24 December 2022,"It's an interesting idea for a show.Unfortunately the depth of character development is very shallow leaving you uncaring about characters succeeding or failing. This leaves you uncommitted to the plot as you don't really care who lives or who dies. The plot also seems to be very shallow and meandering leaving you confused as to the direction that the program may take. The English dubbing is very very poor and obviously cheap. They could have spent some more money getting better actors to provide the voices. Comparing the show to the squid games is very obvious as they are both coming from the same type of genre. However this show fails to capitalise on the excitement the squid games left viewers wanting more of.

dandhyoon,Interesting start devolves into lame nonsense,5/10,26 October 2021,"I've done something like this also in my creative writing class. I start with a great story with interesting characters and a unique premise only to realize I can't find a logical ending to tie it all together. So I throw a bunch of nonsensical crap at it and hope the teacher doesn't notice. C-

sullybolly,Cliché Live Action Anime,4/10,25 September 2021,"The writing's not the best, the acting's not the best, there are plot holes, people get lucky for plot convenience or because it looks cool, and the exposition's not the best, leading to moments that are supposed to be emotionally deep but fail.It's also got your usual mix of cliché anime characters; the smart one, the cool one, the wimpy one, the tough one, the bad guy's weird and creepy henchmen, etc.But, the concept is interesting and so are the games, and the sets are well designed too. So it does keep things entertaining enough to sit through it. Although, it's a good thing it was only 8 episodes, because even that started to drag a bit.Since there are enough good and bad elements, it lands at a solid 5/10.

adaptor,"Nothing new but, generally, well done",7/10,27 October 2021,"This series started off great but became more generic and less interesting around episode 5: the writing started to feel quite forced. I still finished and enjoyed it. I'd say it started at an 8 but was a 5 or 6 before it ended. So, averaging out to 6 or 7.

christinathegoose,s2 - even better than s1,9/10,28 December 2022,"Season 1 had me with the synopsis since dystopian thrillers are my cup of tea. A very, very, very large amount of gore, though. Also, this may be harmful for some viewers' mental health (s**ual assault and su*cide are depicted), no shame in avoiding it for this reason.Although disturbing, I found it to relate to the plot enough so I continued on and I'm glad I did. The first episodes of season one explained the new world in a very show don't tell sort of way which I appreciated. Because of this, there was shock after shock which were like pieces of a puzzle that made sense only after a few of them had been already put in place. In other words, this show has very odd writing since it's genius in retrospect, but it's confusing until the first episodes have passed.This is something that would've made me remove a point, had I written this before s2 came out. I was initially very annoyed with the fact that viewers had no idea *why* the characters were in this alternate world. I do still think that it lessens our dedication to the outcome, but it makes complete sense after the reason is given in the last episode of season 2. This is what I mean by genius in retrospect, very interesting writing.The one point I did take off, however, is due to the ""Beach Arc"" if that's what it may be called. I simply had difficulty staying interested and too many characters were introduced at once. I don't remember it too well either. Nonetheless, I implore people interested in the show to try it until at least episode 3, which I found to be the best in season 1. It had me crying for half an hour.Anyways, season 2. I'm writing this minutes after finishing it. It's 2am so everyone is asleep, I'm here because I need to put my opinions on season 2 somewhere. Episode after episode, I was able to enjoy *what* was happening in the current plot without obsessing over *why* it was happening. I think it's because the main characters generally came together and emphasized what their goal was (""returning"") in s2, whereas the character goals were more scattered and less concrete in s1. Speaking of characters, everyone seemed to get development. From the HOSTS of games to side characters, their current actions were almost always explained through showing their past experiences. This made for plenty of emotional exchanges between game hosts and players, which I was NOT anticipating (there can only be one winning side). The cast for s2 was still large, but those that remain until the final episodes have clear dynamics between them and are recognizable as a team. Also, the acting is just incredible from s1 to s2. The pain is s1 episode 3 was heartbreaking and the heartfelt dialogue shown in the final episode were both genuinely impactful.I also want to mention the cinematography of this show. It's absolutely phenomenal. I'm not one who knows much about cameras or can typically look at a shot and say if its good or not, but there were some scenes with such high budget sets and great effects that I came to focus more on the camera crew's effort than the actors. This specifically occurred in episode 6 of s2 while the camera was steadily following, turning corners with, and jumping down with the actors while they did their stunts. I felt just like I was playing a video game, incredible!About the ending of s2, I'm labeling this as no spoilers so I'll just speak generally about how I felt. Again, the writing for this show is super weird but good. Things sometimes don't make sense...until they do, then you can look back and go ""oh my god,"" the final episode of s2 was the epitome of this and I loved it. It was extremely satisfying and, had I known everything about the alternate world the characters ended up in, the ending would not have been so enjoyable. It makes sense in the end, I love this show. (also, I kind of hope there isn't a season 3... I think s2 is a perfect ending!)"
Lukasmj,"Has some logical issues, but all in all really good.",8/10,9 March 2023,"In short, ""Alice in Borderland"" is a very strong series with a lot of potential, which in my opinion only has small points of criticism - but more on that later.First of all, I would like to rate the style of the series in general, because this particularly stood out for me in this series.What immediately catches your eye is the grandiose camera work. Whoever was responsible for this did a really excellent job. Anyway, the way the camera captures the events was a big motivation for me to continue watching the series and the main reason why my attention really didn't let up for a moment.I have to give another compliment to the scenes. Be it the backdrops for the games, ""The Beach"" or the city. All the backdrops look really convincing and grandiose. Also, the CGI backdrops were so well done that you could hardly tell they weren't real.I would also like to emphasize the grandiose effects of the series. Apparently, Asian productions still use ""real"" special effects instead of doing them on the computer, which is actually the norm these days. But it's definitely worth it. The effects look much more realistic than effects from larger budget productions.Finally, you just have to say again that the actors sometimes played their roles really convincingly. Of course there is a bit of overacting here and there, but that's completely normal in Asian productions, because emotions are always portrayed a bit more exaggerated.Coming back to the actual story, I have to say that I really liked it too. The cast was made up of many different personalities who all complement each other well. I didn't feel like any character was superfluous in any way.Unfortunately, I have to say that the mystery of the series doesn't make much sense when you think about it. At least that's my feeling.But the series is good anyway.I would also like to remind everyone who compares this series to ""Squid Game"" that this concept of imprisoning ""players"" and then having them fight each other in life and death games is nothing new and in Japan, especially in manga and anime area has often been implemented in various modifications.Just a few examples are ""Danganronpa"", ""Darwin's Game"" or ""Tomodachi Game""."
roxmewild,Great concept well written,9/10,20 December 2020,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this new show that's once you get through the first episode which I watched a dubbed version that also had subtitles which was funny as a lot of what was said was not what the subtitles said!
I found the first episode a little strange and slow but then it is Japanese and so culturally different the3 friends appeared quite childish as in immature in first episode. However the show picks up from 2 nd episode and I found it better to watch with subtitles and not dubbed
The concept is different which makes it an unique show and gripping as I binge watched all 8 episodes
Looking forward to next series I think this will get a lot of positive reviews and be nominated for awards so am confident there will be a season 2

steveinadelaide,"Engaging and fast-paced, with plenty of twists to keep you guessing",7/10,12 February 2023,"SEASONS 1-2I've just finished watching Season 2 of Alice in Borderland, the Japanese Netflix series that has been a huge hit worldwide. The show follows Arisu (Kento Yamazaki), Karube (Keita Machida) and Chota (Yuki Morinaga), three friends who find themselves in an alternate reality where they must compete in life-or-death games to survive.The series is based on a manga of the same name by Haro Aso and is set in Tokyo, Japan. It follows our trio as they struggle to make sense of the strange world they have been thrown into. They soon discover that their lives are in danger as they must participate in games created by an unknown entity, and it is up to them to find a way out before time runs out.Alice in Borderland is an intriguing mix of genres, combining science fiction, fantasy, action-adventure, and horror elements. It's a blend of intense action set pieces which kept us on the edge of our seats and suspenseful psychological horror which kept us guessing.The show also explores the idea of fate, as Arisu and his friends must make complex decisions about their future in this world full of dangers. The series does an excellent job of showing how characters can be pushed to their limits when faced with impossible tasks and how they cope with these challenges. It also dives deep into themes such as friendship, loyalty, determination, and courage, making it a captivating watch for viewers 16 years of age and up. It's unsuited for younger audiences due to its dark and violent themes.The production value is also top-notch, with stunning visuals and a gripping soundtrack that adds to the tension and atmosphere. The series features a talented cast who bring their characters to life authentically.It does have some irritating flaws, which lead to my score for this series. First, the show could have been more imaginative. It feels a bit too formulaic sometimes, and viewers may want something a little more original. Second, some of the plot points seem rushed and underdeveloped, which can distract viewers trying to follow along with the story. The acting is occasionally over the top, and the show is often extremely violent. And the ending of Season 2 goes on for too long.Despite these flaws, Alice in Borderland is an entertaining series that has captured the attention of audiences worldwide. Its thrilling action set pieces and psychological horror will keep you on your toes until the end. Its unique blend of genres and themes makes it a must-watch for science fiction, fantasy, action-adventure and horror fans."

cpgpww,Season 2 screwed the viewer on so many levels...,3/10,2 January 2023,"Season 1 was quite interesting and promising. But Season 2 is so full of cheap dialogues, poor plots and wannabe turns and twists. It could have easily fitted into movie length of 2 hours. The motives of the Characters are not comprehensible most of the time and i don't feel good or bad for any of them, they are meaningless to me. They are so cliché and interchangeable. Since S2E5 i began to skip very often because it was nearly unbearable to watch, also because of so much bad acting which felt like fake deepness and wannabe emotions while watching. I am very disappointed about this uninspired and way to long Season 2. The Viewer gets screwed in my opinion and i hope there won't be a season 3. 3 Stars because of the good look and action tho.

migas_rod,Average rating for an average show,5/10,25 December 2020,"This show starts good enough, intriguing, it leaves you hanging for what is to come. This is for the first two episodes, after that you can see clearly it lacks depth, characters are weak, they are not likeable. The series was based on a manga and there are moments where it feels like you're watching some kind of budget anime with real people. Flashbacks to some characters lives that bring nothing new to the table there is absolutely no reason for them to be shown. Special effects lack quality at times, and the show gets dull and you feel like there is nothing they can do anymore to save it at some point. It ends aiming at a second season but I feel like I had enough with this one.

thekarmicnomad,Great first season - not so much on the second,6/10,30 December 2022,"This starts of as really interesting, dramatic Sci-Fi where some ordinary people are sucked into a desolate version of their home city where they have to compete in devilish and dangerous games.The first season takes a tone shift about half way through that really ramps the action up.The second season lands quite badly.The main issue is a cultural one, the pace of Eastern films tends to be slower (Akira Kurosawa had no issue of long scenes of people eating their dinner in the rain) and I am normally down with that.It makes a great change to the rushed Hollywood movies.Here though it is just too slow for me.The amount of walking, posturing and lamenting sent me reaching for the fast-forward button.Then after an hour of nothing but sobbing and navel-gazing it is time for another game - but no this time the game is time lapsed out.There is also some sloppy film-making here.A bad guy shows up shooting people left and right.The enormous body count this guy clocks up only highlights the thickness of the main characters' plot armour and he is only an issue when the plot needs him to be.He is also a bit silly, it feels like the randoms could survive him if they just stopped running wildly up and down the middle of the street.All that being said, this is really well made and acted, there is a lot to like and I enjoyed how different this movie is, and the story is really intriguing.The problem for me is it is wrapped in layers and layers or emotional baggage that often didn't really go anywhere.I would love this to be condensed into a movie or two."
kimdarrelmcx,Perfect two seasons,10/10,26 December 2022,"This must be the best netflix series I've watched to date. Again, people know that this is better than Squid Game. People who are giving this lower review don't know quality series. Each episodes are tense, action and acting are superb. This show really deserves a Season 3.There are lot of lessons you will learn. There are lot of scenes that will move you. There are lot of games you will enjoy to watch. There are lot of characters you will love from start til the end.How sad this doesn't get the awards it deserves?Anyway, lot of 6 or 7 star-rating are sometimes way better than the 8 or 9 overrated series right. That explains it. These days, anything can be manipulated. Awards, reviews and almost everything. Let's just judge it on our own taste and be happy on what we are watching.For me, this show is 10/10!"
jmalam-231-309685,Kinda bad and depressing,4/10,7 October 2021,"The first couple of episodes are decent enough, group of young lads, not sure about their futures, living on the edge of society, get thrown into this alternate reality where everyone else has disappeared.The sum of the 3 characters adds up to something interesting.Then it all goes downhill fast and we're all of a sudden left with a male and female protagonist who are wooden, dull and wildly uninteresting.The male lead's primary character trait is 'spacing out'. For one episode he struggles for an hour gaffa taped to a chair. Fascinating.Other stuff happens. You don't care. There's a silver haired character who looks smugly on during every scene. Not at all annoying.Then you get a random video pointing you towards the next part of the story.Its bad and I felt depressed after watching it."
Kentor1,Decent show,6/10,2 November 2021,"Most of the games were really cool, the show went downhill the last couple of episodes. The acting got pretty bad and beach part was also boring. They also stretched the episodes alot by having the smart characters explain everything to the others who are extremely dumb.

kroma-19-21119,"Very, very, very disappointing!",4/10,17 December 2020,"You can tell that this series is based on a manga. It is extremely exaggerated - unfortunately that also applies to clichés and nonsense. In addition, ""Alice in Borderlan"" unfortunately hardly offers any twists or storylines that are not completely predictable or one-dimensional. Unfortunately, from the first to the last second, the whole thing is an unorginal, illogical and often stupid mess that has not worked with comparable formats such as Qube.

RachelMary2,Started well...,7/10,4 July 2021,"I felt this was a series of almost two halves. It started really well and it was visually interesting, good story, involved characters. But as the series progressed it got less interesting. The last episode in particular I thought was full of time fillers and pretty boring. It could have done with being a six episode series and that would have smartened the editing, which may have helped retain the tension that was there at the start and non existent by the end. Worth watching, just be prepared for it to fizzle out. Th7/10.

bertrandma,Cliché-ridden Japanese Harry Potter,2/10,8 February 2022,"As per the tradition of Japanese anime, the narration is character-driven despite them being all utterly depthless and unoriginal. Every possible tedious manga cliché you could think of: the Hikikomori character who must overcome his insecurities, the insuferable dork who loses his virginity to a desperate sex bomb, the.big-hearted bosozoku, the mysterious white-haired teenager, etc. The acting is atrocious (though I must admit I watched it dubbed, so perhaps take this one bit a grain of salt), and at any rate the script string platitudes that would make any YA film sound like f'ing Shakespear. The world-building so far is mediocre (Im at EP3), a shotgun wedding of Harsh Realm and Battle Royal, without the grit of the first nor the minimalism of the second.Animes are rarely 'good stories' - when they are 'good animes' it is usually because they are redeemed by spectacular graphic feats, or because the freedom afforded by drawing allows what a camera couldn't. Animes or mangas adaptation are usually terrible, most of them basically just fan-service, the rest being vacuous action flicks. This series belongs to the later."
firatberkk,The idea is good,5/10,21 December 2020,"Where everything had started was pretty catchy to be honest, but everything loses its reality with each episode. I did not like the acting that much and some of the dialogs made me laugh due to nonsense.

TheWatcher17,Epic fun and beautifully executed! (Season 1 & 2),10/10,27 December 2022,"This show is just incredible, it literally feels like you're watching a real-life anime. Both Season 1 and 2 are amazing and well written. The characters are all likeable and each have deep backstories and play a different part in the overall ensemble. The action scenes throughout the series (especially in Season 2, Episode 7) are just absolutely insane! Yes, some of the elements are unrealistic, but it's a fiction story based on the comics. One of the most brilliant parts of this show is the scale and extravagance of the location shooting (not simply CGI like lots of other shows do) and the beautiful cinematography. When you watch the behind the scenes videos of how they filmed some of the quiet city scenes in the most busiest parts of Japan, it really shows the amount of effort they put into this show. I really hope Netflix gives us a Season 3. Highly recommend!

edlc1970,Very entertaining,10/10,14 December 2020,"Finally Netflix delivers an entertaining series in another language than english thats worth watching. This series is totally mindblowing, with an element of Escape room in a post-apocalyptic like parallel world. Its based on the Manga series by Taro Aso. And it does it quite good and stays true to the Manga. I highly recommend watching this. Only downside is, that there is only 8 episodes. Plot is nice and just like in the Manga, the main characters is stepping into what seems to be an empty festival, they are greeted by a woman who tells them that they have already ""entered their game"". After clearing the game, she reveals to them that, in Borderland, they must play games to survive. Very entertaining"
jeroen47,Terrible final three episodes and not a must watch overall,6/10,23 December 2020,"The first five episodes were decent. Some 'unnatural' parts were tolerable by keeping in mind this was originally a graphic novel.The final three episodes were painful to go though and were terrible. The flaws include: actions that are not believable, flashbacks or scenes that are being repeated in the exact way, unnecessary flashbacks (for minor characters), unnecessary fight scenes (between minor characters).The quality of the final three episodes made me drop two stars from what I would have rated the series based on the first five episodes. Overall, the story contains a lot of murder, is not very deep or inspiring, and is not a must watch.Maybe you can watch only the first five episodes, but the story does make you curious what happens next.To give you an idea of my taste: some of the TV series or movies that I love are 'The OA', 'Sense8', 'Beastars', 'Dark', 'Arrival', and 'Interstellar'."
DaKiefB,It's okay.,3/10,17 October 2021,Season 1The anime memes are real. The last game felt like it was never going to end. The whole show is very predictable. My girlfriend and I both guessed at the very beginning of the 10 of hearts challenge that she killed herself and that should be the first body to throw on the fire. How did not one person think of that?Season 2I feel like Arisu is trying really hard to be a real life anime dude. The way he runs and his facial expressions just don't seem natural at all. The pacing of season 2 is god awful so far. 1 game was broken up between 3 episodes is far too much. It didn't need to be that long.
armyofrichard,Much worse than Squid Game. Garbage show,1/10,4 October 2021,"No wonder this show was a flop and no one knew it existed until Squid Game became a global hit. I cannot believe anyone recommending this after watching Squid Game. This show was a disaster with terrible acting and meaningless characters that evoke no emotion whatsoever and so many loopholes. Plot fails, reminds of Black Mirror at the end.

kdzsppzbt,Season 1 and 2 review :) (SPOILERS),9/10,26 December 2022,"WARNING ALOT OF SPOILERSImma say this right away, this is my favorite netflix series so far. This review does include alot of content, please be aware.NOTICE: My english is bad lmaoSeason one:
Wow just... wow... its has it pure entertainment with gruesome content and the mysterious story behind it. I find this very first season a totally new view how tv shows can be made. This is the horror I always wanted: games, death and drama all put together. The most interesting tho must be who planned this whole operation, why is this happening and what to do next? Later in the show, you realize Arisu won't continue playing with his friends as they died due to a game. This is where it gets more interesting and complicated but it completely nailed it the rest of the season. Its just too fkn badass.Season two:
YEESSSS ITS BACK, FINNALY! AFTER A LONG WAIT ALICE IN BORDERLAND HAS FINNALY GOT IT SECOND SEASON. We do get a great mf start. The players gets killed in the beginning and it just make sense. A game going on at the same time you're not playing a game which was the spades king. Arisu meets new and old people from the beachhouse and makes friends. This season was a badass comback for the story and the end just make sense.Disappointment:
Theres two things I'm disappointed over, the extras acting was sometimes really bad. And the last episode where we get to the final game, it was confusing and didn't feel like a ""final boss"" game. But still, it was good and managed to understand it all.Rating:
S1: 10/10
S2: 8/10Overall: 9/10Thank you for this show. It was an honer to watch through it all :)"
Noumenonn,Not great,5/10,13 October 2021,"Below average acting, directing, cinematography, scripting, music, pacing.Premise is ok, execution is bad. Very slow and has little to redeem itself. I had low expectations for something from Japan, and was still disappointed.

toapheebs,Disappointed cz it's not as good as people tell you it is,4/10,12 October 2021,"I won't say too much. Good plot. Lots of potential. Bad cringe acting. Not so good making. Boring in the 2nd half.I think after Squid Game Japanese fans were too eager to promote it & over sold it. The ""underrated"" kink made it stupidly overrated. & I'm not being bitter while talking about the corny acting fr I had to visibly cringe at some of the emotional deliveries. Over the top at everything.

anaaannya,One of the best Manga Adaptation till date!,8/10,1 October 2023,"Alice in Borderland stands out in the ever-expanding landscape of live-action manga adaptations, with two compelling seasons and episodes ranging from 50 minutes to over an hour. This action-packed thriller seamlessly blends multiple genres, including action, adventure, horror, thriller, fantasy, and sci-fi, taking viewers on an emotional rollercoaster.The series, set in post-apocalyptic Japan, unfolds in a world between life and death, where various groups of people fight for survival. They participate in death matches while navigating a twisted limbo, engaged in a never-ending battle for their lives. The ultimate goal is to defeat the leaders and return to reality while grappling with the unknown causes of their misery and losses.Alice in Borderland is mindblowing from start to finish. The visually stunning post-apocalyptic landscape captures the essence of a devastated Japan. Each death match's design and staging fantastically immerse the audience in that survival world.Despite the peculiarities of its characters, the series maintains its charm. While some might point out plot holes in certain game scenarios, the sheer variety of survival games is a delightful spectacle, offering a diverse range of challenges and thrills.Not all games are created equal, but particularly games involving Chishiya, leave an indelible mark. The brutality of the games, whether physical, mental, or both, adds an extra layer of realism to the story. Usagi's parkour sequences and a memorable katana duel, for example, are executed with surprising finesse, elevating the series above standard survival fare.Alice in Borderland deftly combines elements of Battle Royale with wit, presenting relatable characters and a reasonable amount of character development. The series succeeds in capturing the essence of its source material, delivering a narrative that is both straightforward and captivating.This adaptation not only follows the manga's conclusion faithfully, but it also exceeds expectations, earning it a well-deserved spot as one of the best manga live adaptations to date. It is highly recommended for those looking for a thrilling and visually stunning experience."
onyxlee,"Pile of plot holes and nonsense, illogical and irrational character decisions.",5/10,27 January 2021,"I get it that this is a great production, but the story and characters are just not that well crafted. Don't get me wrong, I'm very familiar with Japanese culture and the poker faces in most of the Japanese dramas and all, but despite the concept of the show was kind of interesting, this show is better enjoyed with your brain shut off.

cleun018-920-593055,How can you make something SO BORING?,3/10,26 January 2023,"I'm not knocking the story, premise, concept, production and etc... I've finished both seasons. And it has a lot of qualities that could've made it potentially good.Some of the action sequences were actually pretty decent. Mix that with some of the games they played, it could have been quite entertaining.The first thing that destroyed this series - it's dialogue. Stop talking!!! Yap, yap, yap. Everytime there is a game, the explanation took sooooo long. Then whenever anything drastic happens, somebody would blabb on and on and on and on...Second, I don't expect the protagonist to be a super hero. But he is just the most pathetically written lead you could ever imagine. Give some of them long, boring, meaningless, never ending monologues to him, there you go - most unlikable character you can ever imagination."
ibrahimkhan-30185,It's ok to not to be ok,4/10,2 March 2021,"What can I say .A ok series.plot was good but they didn't justify to make it pure class .
Many things happens so quickly and the 1st stage was like last stage .with very short time .so many things happening .in middle it's lost that twist and last episode was just . disappointment .but better then nothing to watch.

Eneser66,Target audience: Young people,6/10,1 November 2021,"Half naked Asians in swimsuit, villain with tattoos & anger issues, the cool boss with sunglasses, female side character with obsession to the main character, everything a teenager would look for is included. The acting was okay but the atmosphere and the way the story got told didnt catch my interest and was kinda dry, especially in the last episodes. We also dont get any explanation about unrealistic stuff that happens in the movie, but also the plot twist is... missing? The ending could be a hint for season 2, so we get more about the plot twist in the following season but not sure if i will watch it.

onurucler1,WASTE OF TIME. P,3/10,28 December 2022,"First season was really interesting and different. Second season has a VERY WEAK script. So many clichés and so many mistakes. (Firing 1536377373 rounds of bullet but not hitting main characters not even at once and Chishiya sacrificing himself was totally unreasonable and unnecessary) Acting also went way down on second season.Main character is a weak little boy. Everyone tries to save him. Last two episode they decided to make him a hero. He built character in last 23 seconds. (Power up like in animes) Everyone got killed ""fighting"" one of the last ace. Everyone took turns to punch him. Unbelievably stupid. There are ""weapons"" basically everywhere. But they just decided to scream at him to death. Soldier got shot in the head but somehow managed to came back from death and shot the grenade like thingy which is thrown by the weakest main character who cried like a little baby and have no self confidence and courage. Building blown up while the soldier and weak boy was in it and after neighbor wrecking explosion they just casually got up. And people who got shot 3 times and stabbed like 9 times were completely okay. Usagi got knee stabbed around five time but she can walk. Girl who got shot by a machine gun around 10 times to the chest from very close distance was walking and looking for her friend. This was close to Bollywood's action movies.I guess the S02 Episode07 name should be ""Endless lives"""
annierlarsen,How is this rated 7.7??,4/10,15 October 2021,"What a dissapointment. Really bad acting, bad Screenplay, bad storyline, just not that good at all.Some fun moment, and nice visuals, But just a huge dissapointment. At least after Squid Game.

a_tuch_f_frst,"Absolutely Brilliant, Loved It",10/10,26 December 2022,"It's such a beautiful series with many unpredictable twists and turns. I was almost put off by the reviews and thank goodness I didn't listen to them! This is one of the best series I've ever watched. Useful tip however: watch it with the original audio and subtitles. The dubbed version is terrible and ruins it.The strongest part of the series are the characters - it reminds me of an anime. They only get more in depth as the series progresses. The games are exciting and engaging, I was on the edge of my seat for some scenes. I'm usually not into psychological thrillers but this one was special. Watch a few episodes and see what you think. Form your own opinion.

barrymw,A nice surprise,8/10,1 February 2023,"I'm not a fan of of Manga or graphic novels in general so have no opinion of the original source material. I watched this solely because it popped up on my ""things you might like"" recommendations on Netflix.With no expectations I enjoyed it right from the off. The title is a giveaway as to what is going on, or so you would think. This is a much more graphically violent story than Lewis Carroll came up with but the mechanics of the classic story are all the there along with all the main characters, Alice, Hatter, Rabbit, Queen of Hearts etc.The games and the violence are just the framework for the real story here, what it means to live, to have something to live for. Unlikely friendships and alliances are formed as they move to towards the ultimate question, why are we here and what happens if we win?The story races along though both series towards its inevitable conclusion. After all we already know what happens to Alice. Or do we? 10/10 for the final episode, a beautifully written and acted masterful piece of television that puts a twist on your expectations that I really did not see coming. Although in hindsight there were plenty of clues.This precedes Squid Game to which there are certain similarities. However, I found that to be overrated and much of a muchness once you had seen the first two episodes, with an obvious ending. This is much better, you care more about what happens to all the characters and you get an unexpected ending where there should be an obvious one."
jetsdead,Don't believe the hype,3/10,2 January 2023,"Not sure why this has such a high rating. To each their own but this was just not good. Find out for yourself but we finished season 1 just to see how it ended and it was pretty torturous. Season 2 is not going to happen.No, definitely not better than squid game.Just like Momoka said, ""I wanted it all to be over"", I just wanted the season to end. So many gaps. So many questions left unanswered. Such ignorant characters that you wished would just die already. Even in a fantasy story, there has to be some kind of common sense and this had zero. Not even a little.There's no chance squid game season 2 could be worse than this. I need to cleanse my mental palate with ANYTHING! I think I'll watch some Norsemen for just plain stupidity."
jillianmonjure-81389,"Live action adaptation done well, despite flaws.",7/10,24 December 2022,"I will preface this by saying, I have tried to read the manga several times and could not for the life of me get into it. The show on the other hand is an entirely different thing.Let's start, the beginning is done well it introduce Arisu and his character while also giving subtle hints about chota and Karube and their life before the games. Ep 1-3 continue with great exposition like this, unfortunately the show is drawn out wayyyy too much as you go further on. Some of the dialogues and scenes of back stories are simply not necessary, many of the monologues are not gripping enough to seem realistic and can easily be shortened into something much more meaningful. Not to mention, Arisu's guilt literally plagues him all the way into season 2 it's almost way to obvious. If the writers made his guilt repressed and took his shame in a different way I think his character could've been a bit more complex but he is only becomes useful at the end of each game. It's a whole lot of running around and ""what do we do? What's going on?"" Before arisu's brain actually work, the more I write the more I realize how useless arisu is in this show 😭. He has little to no purpose other than being the one who questions everything and somehow manages to figure out how clear games despite all odds. Usagi, however, has a deeper character than him as she develops and transforms after meeting and knowing arisu. Arisu is a foil character for her, she almost seems like the main character.Moving on to after the 3rd ep, 4-8 was way too long and drawn out I wished they wouldn't have even put the beach plot in there. It's completely useless after season 1 and only serves as aguni's character plot and introducing more characters. And of course even the characters introduced there get their back story but not even have make it out so what's even the point? Yes give a villain a back story but even minor villains? The real enemy is the game masters, tell us more about them. I have watched both s1 and s2 and have learned so little about the game masters and what is real and what isn't. At this point I'm back to square 1.Season 1 ended on a decent cliffhanger but s2 didn't really pick it up in a great way. We wanted to learn more about the games and the game masters but none of the kings or queens would say anything about them so what is the point in questioning ANYTHING about them. Arisu literally begs them to give even the smallest hint and the only response is ""you'll see 😃"" like bro what? If their reasoning was oh I'll die if I say anything I'd get that but they literally just wouldn't give a straight answer or even a riddle it was nonsense.What I did like though were the action scenes a lot of the characters looked cool as hell, some of the monologues are decent to listen to, and finally some of the villains are actually gripping with their words. For example if u made it as far as the end of s2, I will say I was hooked in the beginning of Mira's monologue to Arisu unfortunately they lost me at the hospital scene which was too long and dumb as hell.Overall fun show for the weekend but not something top-tier :(. Looking forward to season three."

amgbnz,Did I watch the same show?,3/10,20 October 2021,"I'm not sure that I watched the same show that those who gave 10 stars saw.I'll briefly describe what I saw. 3 'losers' hide in a bathroom stall and get thrown into an alternate version of their world where the only people who survived were those who look good in a bikini. Even though everyone is gone and stores are fully stocked the office girl continues to wear heels and work clothes in life-or-death physical games. Episode 3 was supposed to be heart breaking but we are not invested enough into these characters to care if they die. Just because you laugh and eat ramen together doesn't mean you are a great person. The first 4 episodes were interesting because of the games but then in episode 5 the show becomes a frat party and switches to something completely different. It's high school drama class, literally everyone is the same age, the same height, the same hair, its hard to tell the characters apart. The bad acting gets worse, in comes cult-leader guy, CSI girl, inked swordsman and the return of the violent thug and blond dude who is kinda cool (has anime hair). The Tarantino-loving creators pour on the violence, so much so that its just boring and not effective.The only interesting character is the former wedding gown salesgirl who brings a cell phone to a sword fight, and of course always wearing a bikini. Even rock climbing girl is not interesting although she traps and eats rabbit instead of free food from abandon stores. Which brings me to the main character, Arisu, besides also having anime hair-style he doesn't really fit or carry the series and seems more like a spectator. He is surrounded by idiots to make his look better. But he likes to scream a lot and can take a beating.Games are clever but only solved through random and specific info that only Arisu knows, this means that the audience can only spectate and not play along.The final episodes are drawn out with flashbacks that come too late and don't add to the story.I am reviewing and rating this as a standalone series, if you have to read the book or be into manga to appreciate this series then it failed as a storytelling show. I am not rating the SFX or dubbing, that would bring the rating even lower.I guess this is intended for teens but with all the violence, suicide, sex, rape, torture, sexism and mass shootings I wouldn't recommend it."
samyewangdi,Season 2 is lit!,10/10,25 December 2022,"It has so many suspenses and twists will keep you wanting more! Have been waiting for this show for a year and now it has turned up the heat! Japanese manga are a work of art! Forget squid game this is how the real games should be!! Excellent and specially the action scenes are a work of art!I loved season one but season 2 follows the same way it left and does not disappoint... love the acting the screenplay and directing.. everything falls perfectly for the viewers to engage and enjoy.. the roles fit perfectly and the games are truly enjoyable and would have never expected it to turn out the way it did.. Enjoy!

It's like most Japanese shows very violent and sometimes a bit weird, but it never gets dull.Still has a lot of plotholes and not everything is explained but enough to make another season, too bad it has the potential to become repetitive if they milk it out too far.Give it a go next lockdown, you won't be disappointed

walidsabir,"Definetly not a ""good"" show,",7/10,21 July 2021,"It's filled with many ""bad"" little things that just ruin the whole show. The acting can be very very cringe sometimes. The whole series just feeling like a teenage show and not something for grown-ups.At the same time, there is some potential in the story, there is some very good suspens, but that's about it. SO i would not say this is a horrible show, but at the same time, I wouldn't say this is a good or solid show.If you have really nothing on your watch-list, and you pretty much saw the major highly-rated tv shows, then watch this while waiting for another good show or another season of your favorite show.

Chaokage,My Cup Of Tea!!!,10/10,11 January 2021,"Perfection is what it is. Despite the obvious fact that I will be one of those who will die from the first game, I really enjoyed it. Series that focus mainly on intellect as its driver usually come up great and this one was a gem. A must watch for anyone looking for something outside the box.

MoistMovies,"Finished it all, best manga adapation so far",9/10,14 December 2020,"It's a bit of a common topic that every manga/anime adaptation into live action fails.. I mean none of them have been great so far... This is the best we've been given. For comparisons sake.. watch the first 5 minuets of the netflix 'deathnote' movie..Go have a shower for about 45 mins, take a lot of xanax to forget you saw those first 5 mins and then watch this series..Watch it in Japanses with subs, I didn't bother with the dub but it really was pulpy awesome scifi. Im a total cynic but I know when to turn my brain off and not pick apart things because the core of what I am watching is great.Normal score a solid 7/10 but giving higher because its a successful manga adaptation that isnt terrible

vad19894,I am impressed,9/10,23 December 2020,"The theme is unique. The story is well developed, well explained and not repetitive . For a tv series , that alone is the most important. Aside from that, acting is on point. Music is ok. But the movie effects and how they created a completely humanless setting wowed me. A really good thriller series.

milinskis,Season 2 does not let down,10/10,24 December 2022,"This is not squid games and I don't see the point of comparison just to criticize one show at some aspect that it did better than the other. Both shows are phenomenal.Happy to see season 2 turned out to be so great, because in some series with sequel seasons the quality drops, this is not the case here. My favorite games were Jack of hearts and queen of hearts, it was so unexpected.I was happy to see this development of main characters, questions about the virtues, ideals and freedom that they showed. There really aren't that many shows as interesting as this one, I recommend it to everyone.

nathancarthy,Started to lose interest at the beach,4/10,10 October 2021,"I was hooked with this then they got to the beach and the witchhunt began, after that it's was pointless back stories for characters that died anyway. It started to drag out over the last few episodes at this point too.And the acting started to become worse with each actor."

DrProfessor,Such creative writing.,9/10,15 December 2020,"I haven't watched many Japanese movies in the last 15 years or so. The commitment to such story arcs I fear may drive off some viewers, but in my opinion they are timed perfectly. The balance between the action and the intrigue doesn't have me reach for my phone to check my email. I look at that as a win since once you've seen enough western television you're more or less likely to feel a familiar rhythm.Now that I've finished this series I can't wait to see the next season.

captainpat,Goes Downhill Fast.....,5/10,28 May 2023,"The first two episodes of Alice in Borderland were well done and left me wanting more. They were very cleverly crafted, with a unique premise that drew me into the story right away. However, I was very disappointed by the next 14 episodes which seemed to go downhill fast.Instead of building on the strong foundation established in those first two episodes, the show became increasingly repetitive and failed to grow its storyline or characters in any meaningful way. With each passing episode, it felt like the art of clever storytelling disappeared entirely.I found myself wondering why they stretched out this lackluster plot over so many pathetic episodes when it could have been condensed into a much tighter and impactful narrative. It got so bad that I even hurt my finger fast forwarding through most sections during season two.Overall, Alice in Borderland just didn't live up to expectations - especially when compared to other recent hits like Squid Game from Korea which truly pushed boundaries with their creative storytelling approach. Save yourself some time and skip this one altogether!"
Stephan_fr,"Just like westword, season 1 is brilliant, season 2 is a let down.",7/10,17 January 2023,"No surprise, I'm not even mad. TV productions do not know if they will make it to S2, never mind S8, so they have to 'conclude' S1 if they want to give the viewer a meaningful ending, while giving enough a cliffhanger to get renewed.And again, zero surprise here, when you adapt a manga, or a book, you get the quality of the book for your first season, and season 2 onwards has to be 'winged'. This is why most 'brilliant' TV series will be defined by their first season (BSG, Westworld), while failing to impress, or severerely disapointing the viewer in subsequent episodes.Casting becomes more difficult overtime. GoT had books to follow and could afford a 'crimson wedding'. ""Alice in Borderland"" is not so lucky.Essentially, I feel as a mini series it would have peaked at S1e3, which is a masterpiece, and borrows heavily from cult classics such as Bokeh. Not only is it well scripted and clever like Black Mirror, but it's also beautifully shot.S2, on the other hand, breaks the format of the first season and delivers the episode in a syncoped fashion that simply doens't fit the 'dramatic, gut wrenching' mood of the show. In fact, it disarms it totally, and eventually, quite frankly it no longer matters who lives or dies.By S2E4, they could have killed the lead and I probably would still have finished it, out of lazyness and pot commitment.I'll go leave a separate review for S1 E3, which is simply brilliant, but be forewarned: It's probalby best to stick to the first season if you don't want to get a Westworld moment again."
yoshiduyen,Recommend watch!,10/10,12 December 2020,"Don't let the criticism/hate get to you and just Ignore the low ratings and watch and judge for yourself. Personally I enjoyed the series! As a manga reader and anime watcher I definitely think they did a decent job with this series in most aspects. Though it is not exactly the same as the manga in some parts it still manages to keep the thrill of it. Yes this concept of escape room and survival of the fittest is used a lot, But trust me this series was super interesting and kept my family of all ages entertained. Hopefully they don't cancel this and will release a 2nd season! Don't sleep on this masterpiece.

astronaute-1,Overdramatized piece of crap,2/10,25 December 2022,"Characters are shallow, acting is poor, actors are crying non stop over petty things and for long time, and worst of all, every single piece of action is just not realistic at all. I understand this is fiction, but come on, at least try to make it more relatable. Fighting scenes are too long and unremarkable. Bad guys are slow, clumsy, stupid and without energy. Good guys are the luckiest ever, surfing between the bullets and when injured are able to chill and heal on the streets faster than in a hospital. This would be a nice comedy if characters were not crybabies.As others already pointed out, this tv show is probably for younger, or at least more impressionable, audience.

hellandjonny,This is bad...really bad.,1/10,15 October 2021,"I mean...it's Bollywood-bad. It's just horrible all around from plot to screenplay, story and acting. The plot leaps over unplausible hurdles to create a downright stupid, childish story that runs of in evey possible direction. It COULD have been Tron-, Matrix- or Cube-believable, but turns in to complete ludacris. I mean, whoever wrote the outline had to be a drunk, childish hentai-fan that just wanted to portray the ""games"" with as much blood as possible with no concern as to how we got there. The huge problem with that is the whole thing crumbles on itself without clever writing or a plausible twist, even for a sci-fi! Then, in raging panic I presume, they try to put at least some substance in to a flapping story by shoving toothpaste back in the tube and jamming some malpositioned flashbacks in to the end-scenes of the last two episodes, sucking whatever air was left out of the room.To top it all up the manuscript is so flawed, so incredible amateuriatic and thin that a 14 year old comicbook-fan could do a better job under the influence of hormones. Even worse - the dialog and acting is far, FAR below anything I have ever seen professional actors do. It's so extremly over-acted and thin (even for low budget asian standards) it's embarrassing, and quite frankly - boring throughout the whole thing. The only reason I stuck it out for eight episodes of the same ""gung-ho-child-with-a-gun"" BS was to see if they managed to tie something together in the end. Nuuuup. Flying blimps with cards on 'em, sweaty teenagers with fake fear and/or courage on their faces and a plot-twist to drag things out for the money. This is so God awful that the original Battle Royale looks like an Oscar-movie. I've had enough over-acted, screaming, teenage, collage-project for the rest of my life. Let's just hope the same goes for Netflix."
ITrifonov,Logic = none,3/10,28 December 2022,"I love Japanese stuff, but this is so stupid that it is painful to watch. It is the Steven Seagal equivalent of series in terms of logically written or bland characters behaving. The main protagonist is someone who spent all his time on playing video games - yes this is his main character thread and this is why we have to care about him. The rest are interchangably shallow and bring nothing, but you asking - someone was paid for writing this? If Squid Game was good, this has no value or anything that might keep you watching, even fast forwarding it bored the hell out of me. I just gave the 3 stars, because I like listening to Japanese language.

frederick-benny,Television show that believes it's an anime,6/10,10 October 2021,"A little bit childish with over the top bad acting, and a wafer-thin plot.Seems like an anime turned into motion picture without any attempt to make the characters or setting more realistic. It might have worked in the anime format but in this form, it just comes across as unnecessarily dramatic, corny and a bit annoying. Won't be keeping my eyes peeled for Season 2, but perhaps I'm not the target audience.

CubNutButter,Incredible work of art,9/10,13 June 2021,"I was so shocked to see another review on here stating that the show got progressively worse as it went on ""like most other Japanese TV shows"", and I'll agree that this is quite often the case with series of this type, but honestly in this case I could not disagree more.This show is an absolute masterclass in modern Japanese storytelling and it's maintained right through to the final episode. I watched it in the original Japanese with English subtitles but paid close attention to the references to characters from the famous Alice in Wonderland stories.There is unfortunately some cases of poorrepresentation of female characters, in that many are fully able, combat-trained survival types that are somehow suddenly and inexplicably incapable of fighting off weak, petite boys trying to subdue them... but other elements of the show give hope that representation and inclusion in Japanese films may be changing for the better.That aside, every episode is a thrill ride of its own, full of hidden messages and unique shots of a deserted, lifeless Tokyo that's practically impossible to imagine. I am desperately awaiting a second season and will welcome it with open arms."
ThereelscoopwithKK,Unpredictable and Entertaining (Season 2 Updated),9/10,6 December 2022,"Season 1: This show certainly keeps you on your toes. It's bold and takes risks. Sometimes it's hard to say whether they paid off or not. For example, killing off all of Arisu's close friends so early in the season after spending quite a bit of time building up their characters definitely had to be a tough decision. The first episodes alongside his friends were very good and then the show almost reinvents itself midway through the season with the introduction of the beach. This isn't to say that the loss of his friends didn't play a significant role still , it certainly did, but it completely changed the dynamic.Arisu and Usagi have a good chemistry throughout and their budding romance is quite believable .I'm not sure the lengthy ending after the beach was burned down was necessary. It sets up season 2 , but takes a long time in doing so all to simply say there will be more games.One thing that's certain is the show has no issue killing off anyone at any point so it is sure to remain interesting.While I really enjoyed this season , it didn't seem to pull me in as much as Squid Game did.Season 2: I loved this season. It took all of the good parts from the first season and elevated them even higher. Sure there are still some slow parts but you really care for the characters more and more over time. Some of the games are so simple and yet so brilliant.Some of the dialogue is absolutely brilliant. The only issue is that I wanted more of Chishiya. In some ways this character is so strong that it overpowers Arisu. The prison cell game is as good as any game in Squid Game, Hunger Games, and season 1.The conclusion is also really well done. I thought it was about to let me down, but came through huge at the end.Hard to say if there will be a season 3, I would guess not, but I will greatly miss this show, taken altogether it was simply awesome."
schanzaysohail,"Great Acting, Well-written plot",8/10,19 October 2021,"This show had a great start, every episode made me want more. Every game had me thinking and routing for the charcters, the complexity and the easiness of each game really kept me going. The character writing was great until the beach arc where things got a little rough... I'm ot necessarily saying that the beach arc was made but it couldve been more clean and smooth and overall done better. They kept forgetting certain points that were to remebered from previous epsiodes which was quite annoying. The charcter writing for this arc was great, somthing new each episode. They lift at us on an almost cliff-hanger here, which really made us want more but to my own suprise there will be no season two for almsot an year or so if i'm correct. The acting and sets were great, very fitting and well-made. 8/10 would recommend to anyine who wants something short to binge which will distract them for a while.

poinla37,great,9/10,8 February 2021,"This series is rather true to the original manga, but at the same time, the characters look realistic (sometimes when they try to stick with the original material, you get some ""colorful"" characters that are not very realistic).
I really hope they make a 2nd season (probably no 3rd though, seing how they wrapped up things in season 1, they won't have enough for a 3rd, except if they have some fillers (origin stories and parallel stories) like in the manga).
All in all, good acting, great scenery, great filming, CGI are decent."
saltarismenos,Not bad and not a master piece.,5/10,8 May 2022,"I can't say that it is boring in any case. The first half was very interesting, after a certain point far fetched. Perhaps if it was planned for one season instead of two it could be much better. Not a master piece but not trashy either. I watched it pleasantly, but i am afraid what the second season will be.

melretsa,I don't get the hype at all,1/10,23 March 2021,"The theme is okay but there have been way better movies using it ( see as the god's will ) . The plot holes are constant and in one extent that the series are a whole mess . The death games are boring , the characters shallow and stiff and the cinematography plain . There are 0 likeable characters I swear , their back stories make no sense + the series drastically changes in the 3 episode and it's still bad . Aw and the worst thing is definitely the pace ITS SO SLOW nothing literally happens for like the whole episode . This could be like 5 minutes episodes , still trash but not such a big waste of time

The_Swedish_Reviewer,"Fantastic hi-tech movie, poor acting",6/10,5 January 2023,"S1 was pretty good. The build up was good but when more actors were added it shows how bad Japanese actors and directors are. Maybe it's a cultural thing but afaik, the whole ensemble needs acting lessons. Especially the beach part, many characters totally over the top. Also, the female actors are young, hot and always dressed in sexy clothes while the male actors are more average in age and appearance. Hello #metoo!The strength of the series lies in fantastic scenes of an abandoned Tokyo that really impressed me. I have never seen such nice post-apocalyptic cities ever on the big screen. But film technology cannot save overacting. I watched the show with Swedish subs and I don't know if it was a bad translation or a bad script, but the lines were so wooden and stiff it was laughable.S2 is not as good. In fact, many of the games are too drawn out and quite boring. The ending was an attempt to be unique but failed because it was so confusing.All in all a fun action show in dire need of better actors and a professional director."
chicaboww,Started ok but....,5/10,15 October 2021,"It started great.. but the last episodes were just disappointing. The main girl character went from being so smart in the beginning turning to an useless character in the end.I don't understand the idea of creating a place call ""the beach"", and why in the last episodes we have to waste so much time digging into these killers' past? Seriously, didnt make any sense and didnt contribute to the story.The connections between two bosses of the Beach are not developed clearly. And the reasons for killing at the Beach episodes are just ridiculous. Half of the time you will have to hear the past stories of the killers, while the two main characters - one is running around the hotel doing nothing special. The other is tied up most of the time and just cried about his friends death from like 3 eps ago.Many people may say the games in this movie are better than in Squid games. It's just harder, not better. The way Squid game builds their characters are just amazing, turning even boring and easy kids game into a creepy survival situation."
agreenfox,not sure what other people are watching...,2/10,21 January 2021,"Read plenty of recommendations and saw screenshots and this show looked beautiful with an intriguing premise.i could only get 25 minutes in. the boys are obnoxious, the dialogue is kinda stale, too many cliche lines. acting is equally obnoxious and just didnt hook me right. could be wrong but i dont see it getting to a place where its watchable to me, sorry

babagannuj,Jigsaw in Cubeland,6/10,3 January 2021,"It is fun to watch new tv series but with some negative things that I couldn't give more than 6/10.Storytelling is so slow especially while people are talking that even urges you to watch in 2x speed without missing anything.There are very few original ideas here that if you like Saw series (especially the first one), Battle Royale, Cube series..etc you'll just watch another example of these without anything new. Only difference here is some blending of those with anime and action. But especially martial arts scenes are not satisfying enough that couldn't reach my expectations.

soeprijo19,"""Life's just like a game, enjoy it""",10/10,15 January 2023,"Review of season 2: 8 episodes of intense action packed that I've bingewatched it only in 1 night without noticing it's already 8 hours passed by. That's how good season 2 of Alice In Borderland was.One thing to add about season 2, how Arisu managed to look like a bum all episodes (except the last 10 minutes). Although he was just drowned in the river or after having onsen bath, he just came out look like a bum. Meanwhile. Chisiya and Ann managed to look neat and white all the time no matter what they do. Kuina always looks hot in her blue bikini. Even Usagi, who trained everyday, still looks good in her camisole. My good Arisu, you really need to go to some stylist.And if, I mean IF, there's season 3, I hope they would explain more about the Borderland universe, rather than threw all fans speculations into it and confused us even more.Great 10/10."
CyricTheCynic,An ok show but becomes somewhat cliche,7/10,28 December 2020,"After watching this show, I said to myself ""this feels like watching an anime"". And lo and behold, I found out later it was actually based on a manga/anime series. Honestly, I thought the show started out really strong but got a bit meh by the end. The first few episodes have a really nice atmosphere and sense of not knowing what the heck is going on, but by the end so many characters are introduced and secrets are revealed that it's just like ""oh, ok"". It also has all the typical cliche characters you are used to seeing in every anime ever, like the dorky but smart kid, the eccentric party guy, the sadistic goth lolita chick, and sadistic right-hand killer dude, you get the idea. Still not a bad watch.

nadijaherdwina,"Season 2, please!",9/10,13 December 2020,"I thought this would be that kind of movie where magic appears all of a sudden when it comes to the main characters' death (Karube and Chota). It turned out I was wrong. It saddens me, but I'm not disappointed. I think that what makes this series felt so real and intense! Also, great characters, although sometimes they act a little bit off. I really enjoyed watching it and I'm hoping for a second season!"
leroyhenzen,"Amazing show, but please kill off Arisu",8/10,4 February 2023,"It's an amazing show and I agree it deserves the hype that Squid Game has, but please kill off the character Arisu. Without him this show would have been one of the best. It's writing and acting are great and it's extremely thrilling and action packed. The games the characters have to play are epic! It also has a lot of important life lessons in it about humanity and they way we live our lives. But the main character Arisu is terrible and a makes all the amazing things about this show less amazing. Characters like Kuina and all the other players are amazing and deserve a lot more screentime. Hopefully less Arisu in season 3.

albukerk18,Most boring show I've ever seen,1/10,4 November 2021,"That's the first time I got deceived by an imdb rating. 7,5? Really? More like 1,5 for the effort only. This show is slow, boring and has no content for long 45min episodes. Seriously, none of the episodes had content for more than 15-20 minutes. It was a pain to watch, even skipping a lot of extremely irrelevant scenes. What a joke.

charleslanobucklin,A Solid 10,10/10,26 December 2020,"This just came up in my Netflix queue as a recommended show to watch. It's a killer show. Lots of action, drama, and terrific musical score. While I am not really into manga I could see how this could easily translate into a movie storyboard. What I loved about the show is that each main character has a backstory that is often touching. The ending has a nice twist and hopefully, there will be a Season 2 - as we leave Arisu and his girlfriend Usagi poised to face more challenge in this hellish dystopian world. Seriously I fell in love with this nail-biting drama and I highly recommend it.

oscosc-78586,Great stuff.,9/10,4 October 2021,"Great stuff. I went into this with few expectations. The first episode looked good and it just kept on getting better.Beautifully shot, well acted (use the Japanese audio and English subtitles)... it keeps you guessing. The only criticism I can actually think of is occasionally overdoing the extreme emotional close up (esp the end of the first hearts game)... but this is minor and probably personal taste.This is a great series and it seems it's been renewed too. Nice.

klausrayer,abnormally bad,2/10,17 December 2020,"I was inspired by the good user rating, it also started quite well when the actors were suddenly all alone. But already at the end of the first episode you could tell the amateur actors. It got worse and worse from one episode to the next, so from the 3rd episode on I didn't feel like it anymore.

scottyhotty2002,Poor with plot holes,2/10,24 October 2021,"How is this rated so high? It started off really good with good character development but fell off flat. It has more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. The killing of the main characters, for what? There is no gain to it. The games make no sense and the beach makes even less sense. For instance how does the woman now the answer to the flood light bulb game yet they don't yet have that card. There's thousands of people there yet they still need loads of cards. There are 58 players in the last game but only 12 phones, they save a phone for Arisu but then Aguni and his crew come who haven't taken a phone.. Then about 100 people are killed, when killing people wouldn't have won the game anyway because they needed throwing on the fire."
midwestdawg83,"Strong start, Bad Finish",4/10,13 October 2021,"The nonsense starts at THE Beach. Plus, more violence against women. Strange and unnecessary to have focus on that.Why do the killers have backstories, but not the decent characters? And such random timing with them.And who would trust teen girls to be in charge of games where people die? That was second dumbest plot point.The dumbest was THE WITCH HUNT game, where a bunch of people get murdered cause the leader said so. Said leader killed his friend, who was also a psycho. And killing his friend made him want everyone else to die and kill others.I had a problem with the shooting deaths, because they seem to stylize the shooters or make their killings seem so easy to do. Japan hasn't suffered mass shootings like the US, so they don't really seem to get the message they're sending. Nobody needs a backstory on the guy shooting a bunch of people. What? Am I supposed to have sympathy for him? He just shot like 30 people.Too much shooting death. Soured the mood of the show and made it not entertaining. I don't wanna see real life on screen in this kind of show."
itsmilenabee,Not sure why I watched the whole thing,5/10,12 October 2021,"This truly does feel like live action anime. I found myself physically cringing at times, the acting is so over the top it's ridiculous. You can find all the anime clichés in this. The robot-like cool person, the insane bald bad guy with tattoos, cringy super emotional good guy greg protagonist...Another user said it feels like whoever made this has no concept of natural human interactions and this was the exact same thing that kept coming to my mind while I was watching the series.The plot is okay (although senseless) but some of the games (or solutions) make no sense whatsoever.There are a lot of androgynous looking actors, if you're into that it might make certain episodes a semi-enjoyable watch for you."
raedtjr,Dont waste your time,1/10,26 December 2022,"This show is so classic. Its not only predictable, it is predictable in the most obvious way.A hero who will survive no matter what...
Show for kids or not even. Dialogs are so cringe and made no sense. I think the idea is good but the execution with the Japanese style is not working. The first season was atleast a bit better in term of story line and events.The second one was boring and as i said predictable and on top a hero that will survive no matter what. Also characters are sometimes dead some other times not. Its obvious they are trying so hard to push drama but it turns out to be cringe all the way.

retroid-00009,Amazing Show Every Episode Feels Like A Movie,10/10,20 December 2020,"The quality of this show puts Hollywood etc to shame! Feels like a live action anime more than any other manga adaptation i have seen before. I know it is based on a manga of the same name but it massively feels like a cross between Gantz and Death Parade which is just a dream come true!The cyber punkesque vibe and music really beef up the atmosphere and actually help make you feel afraid of this city. I went into this not knowing anything about it and hadn't heard of the Manga, it has now made a fan of me and will be treating myself to the manga books at Christmas =)Really hope we get at least another season minimum as this is now one of my favorite shows.

fantasybinge94,Exciting start but ran out of juice,6/10,26 December 2022,"Season 1 started out very flashy, the plot kept me interested, games were unique, I genuinely wanted to find out what happens next at the end of each and every episode.The problem is that is rapidly began to lose steam, starting with the beach house: ""maybe we need to get all numbered cards"", then ""or maybe we need to get all higher order cards"", not to mention how they always felt the need to add at least one random psychopath every step of the way, so out of nowhere, felt very cheap and uninspired, just to make things complicated.But worst of all, I completely dislike how they focused so much on the psychological aspect of it in season 2 to the point where it got boring. I get it, they're all depressed, anxious, suicidal, most of them just want to die, but for the love of god just stop rubbing it in my face every minute of every episode, it goes without saying what they feel, a few scenes is enough, we can guess the rest, you don't need to emotionally damage your viewers.To be completely honest, after seeing episodes 3 and 4 of season 2, it made me realise how I'd like and enjoy so much more if this show was focused solely on Chishiya's journey in this world, by far the best character of the series.Gave it a 6/10, 8 for first part of the first season, 4 for the rest."
pienkrings,Wonderful,10/10,13 December 2020,"They were truly able to capture the feeling of the manga.You could feel the anger and sadness from the characters. It still misses a lot of background information about all the characters but what could you expect in a tv series. I loved how they sualized the games from manga to the bigger screen. One of netflix's best manga to live action.
Overal wonderful

justinwiechers-64708,"At the end of final, you know as much as in episode 1",6/10,10 January 2021,"This show has it good moments, but certainly also its worst. The first two episodes start really interesting but as the show progresses it becomes worse. You sort of follow the main character arisu, and he plays his part okey, but the show fails to build up an emotional connections to the other players. If they die, they die, but the show clearly tries to push dramatical and sentimental moments who are just not there. The most disappointing is the end, you sort of hope you as the viewer are getting information about what happened, why are they in the game world, where are all other people, but there is just nothing.. The viewer who watches the final has as much information as when you started in episode 1... Very disappointing.

christophercoles,Wow not what I expected,8/10,1 February 2023,"I thought the show was going to be a dive. The first episode I think is the most naff as it is setting the scene fairly badly. Post that episode Season 1 is really good. Season 2 I thought was much more fun. I've been glued to the show since watching and there is very little I dislike. If I had to pick one thing - in both seasons it almost felt to fast. I appreciate these are based on the manga comics. Season 2 I would have loved to watch all the face card games, I mean what happened with the queen of diamonds car park game, or the animal in the king of hearts? So that would be my only improvement. A bit more depth especially with the forest and elephants. Why could they not raid shops for food, did it all rot? Season 1 I felt the beach happened to soon - it was an instant step change going from games into the beach hotel. What was the underground? Power grid? Was there more which could have been explored especially with the friendship (that almost felt like a season with the beach as the second). What was that IT hub in the subway. We're there more? Then you have the sword guy and the rubbish gun guy (the translation failed it here) but maybe more subtle story plots could of made those characters instead of stupid ideas with ropey back stories. I almost think this as a whole could have been spanned over 4 seasons with better story improvements - I think it was almost to strict to the comics. With the changes I would be rating ten stars, but 8 stars with its faults is not a shabby score. So if your reading this and haven't watched it - then do! What I loved most was the ingenious games, and I loved the concept of game genres based on card set and number difficulty resulting in days. Those heart games wow what a mind blower (literally)! Loved the blimps in season 2 which was a real nice touch and that the characters independently cleared separate games going their separate ways. I felt the bosses had good back stories king of clubs with his team, queen of spades living in the moment, king of diamonds being a lawyer, just great! Much better than the back stories in Season 1 at the Beach. Netflix best have a season 3! What a surprising show.. really think Netflix preview screener and plot fails to do it justice. Season 2 is better than Season 1 but not season 1 prior Beach being surreal with an abandoned city."
alex-outsiderwolf,"Series, where you already beg someone to kill main character",6/10,29 December 2022,"I was very impressed by season 1 of this title. I liked the idea and how it was implemented. So obviously I was really waiting for season 2.My god I hated last episodes. Ending did saved it, but before I seen the ending, last two episodes I really lost my temper with main character.If it was a target - well the actor did awesome job. It takes some skills to make you hate the main character. Get sympathy to everyone except this Shmunk.Really... graphics, ideas, thoughts.... you really forget about all this, once you become overly annoyed by MAIN CHARACTER.On one side, you may say, well as per final game - it makes sense. It's a Heart's game. So by logic and scenario - all clear and reasonable. Well the problem is that you really annoyed with the guy before the final game. Just ARGH! You already screaming -SOME BODY, JUST KILL THIS USELESS PUNK!!!But, if you struggle, just like me. Don't give up. Ending worth the struggle. Really unexpected and surprising."
scott-82443,Watchable but barely,6/10,9 January 2021,"Worth your time if you can handle all the crying and people being chased by people with guns (but that keep forgetting to pick up dropped guns after they hit them over the head). Definitely a lot of cringe worthy scenes that make you wonder where the adults were in charge of writing and producing this. It gets better toward the end but bogs part of time on last bit.

James_Denton,A brilliant series which at first I didn't like...,9/10,20 February 2021,"As the title suggests, I did not like this series at first... but then I am not a of Japanese anime or some of the other odd things they do (their game shows spring to mind)....However, this series just got better and better and I would encourage anyone who is curious by the series to stick with it, as it has more going on in each episode than initially meets the eye. For example, in each episode there is a clue early on that gives the answer towards the end... what that clue is, I never noticed until they pointed it out... but I thoroughly enjoyed learning what it was.So the good and the bad:
It gets off to a rocky start. Unless you are a Japanese film, or anime, fan you might be inclined to turn it off early on.The acting from the main characters is good.However, the acting from the extras is lousy.The wardrobe department need a rap on the knuckles here (with the extras), everything is too contrived and too 'clean'The series had me hooked soon after the first episode and it only improved from there. I am looking forward to the second season."
mrwankynq,Masterpiece from my heart 💔✨,10/10,18 January 2023,"I got attached to this series very much... I loved everything and felt that the characters are my second family... I don't know why it rated 7/7. In my opinion, this series should be 10/10 without discussion... cinematography... drama .... the events .... the story ... the games ... the plot, the bonding and the twist in the end, this is all 10/10 ... I cannot describe the feelings I am feeling right now, unfortunately there is no third season 💔💔 .... I have I cried... I laughed... I sympathized... I was happy and upset... This show literally conveyed all the feelings to me... I loved every detail in this series.... I will never forget this masterpiece as long as I live. ✨💔

StephenIsADumb,Calm Down Review-Bombers,10/10,21 December 2020,"This is a brilliant show that feels like a true live-action adaptation of an anime. Pacing is great, characters are well-developed, action and CGI is top-notch. Anyone bashing this show is either not into Japanese shows or just jumping on the hate bandwagon. You wanna know why people rate this so highly? Because it is actually that good. Don't listen to miserable people who can't appreciate quality television.

kxxxxxx,"first 7 episodes great, last one is a complete mess.",7/10,13 December 2020,"Intense & fast paced throughout, but sadly not so much for the last episode. it was all over the place & so much nonsense. 2 girls recording the base, walking around & everyone dont seem to even look at them, did they use invisibility cloak? casually heading to enemy base with no fear nor expecting defense/laser etc."
thecinephilereviews,Alice in Borderland (2022),8/10,23 January 2023,"Adapted from the manga of the same name written by Haro Aso, and co-written and directed by Shinsuke Sato. Following the season prior Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki), Yuzuha Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya) and the rest of company enter into the Next Stage where they must face off against the citizens in the 12 face cards. Hoping that after they complete this second stage, it should return them to their world. The stakes have risen to an all-time high in this round as our protagonists are confronted with numerous obstacles that will test their mind, body and soul. After a two
year wait for the conclusion of the storyline. I must confirm that this second season is one of the best Japanese dramas of 2022 due to the exquisite directing and writing from Shinsuke Sato and Yasuko Kiramitsu, whom have crafted a thrilling and tension-inducing sequel that is bound to shake audiences.The performances from the main cast members are phenomenal. Specifically from power couple Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya, who have personified their roles. Becoming two of my favorite characters
of the series. The character-development which I initially felt was absent from the first season was improved upon, breathing life into various characters in Borderland and allowing us to sympathize with each of their journeys. This certainly contributed to my grand experience and now I'm more inclined to
read the manga to explore more backstories. Let us not forget Riisa Naka, who delivers a fabulous portrayal of the Red Queen in the final episode, leaving quite an impression. The conclusion has a beautiful message about creating a better future for ourselves, despite our negative actions in the past. Granting hope for not only the characters but the viewer. Arigato gozaimashita, for the unforgettable adventure down the rabbit hole. Congratulations to the cast and crew for outdoing themselves this time around."
assasin-79156,I was quite unconvinced,5/10,26 December 2020,"This series was definitely overrated. Speaking of the scenes, fine, it looks high-budget effects especially the killing scenes. HOWEVER, those games are totally not making sense as a brainstorming series and it seems like only the main character count come up with a unique and no rule-related solutions. Good to emphasize their friendship but if it's nothing to do with the game, DON'T even waste time digging that deep. Generally the speed was too slow.

cotovanastasia,"Overall is the plot twists make you feel addicted to this show, keeping you in suspense until the last minute of episode.",10/10,31 December 2022,"One of the top releases 2022. I appreciate the most unexpected turns and well acting. The whole plot was original despite of the existing shows as Squid Game that got a lot of appreciation. In fact I saw first ''Alice in borderland '' which turned to be well though from many perspectives, so when I finished it, I got thirsty of this type of tv show and I started watching squid game hoping is even better (after all the hype it got) but it turned to be complete opposite.Overall the plot twists make you feel addicted to this show, keeping you in suspense until the last minute of episode.The music, the visual effects, the acting is professional, it is veasible when the director is good at his job.

sinefilcinephile,Loved it.,9/10,20 December 2020,"I had some reservations about the series as I have never seen a Japanese TV series before. The idea is so original and well-written. It's exciting, intense, and interesting. A group of misfits are transported to a parallel universe where you have to play to survive. The whole world is a play stage. Time to binge now.

ellika95,Extremely misogynistic and overdramatized,4/10,22 December 2022,"The story's not bad at all. It's kind of a more violent version of Squid Games. I love the apocalyptic/parallel universe aspect. BUT, they are milking some scenes and emotional situations WAY too much. Though I would have still rated it 7 if it wasn't so incredibly misogynistic. The ""strong"" female characters are always somehow reduced to useless degrading moments. For example, Usagi is this strong athletic badass, but somehow can't fight the semi-dying sickly r*pist. I mean come on, how many times did that guy try to r*pe her? The r*pe attempts are just used to objectify her and serve the male gaze. Who still shoots those scenes anyway? Moreover, Arisu is constantly portrayed as her protector although he wouldn't have lasted a day without her. Other women in the show that come up as enemies are also portrayed somewhat weak and less important than their male counterparts.Overall, I would prefer Squid Games. It's not nearly as sexist and also the story doesn't get too distracted by overdramatized lengthy scenes."
moviegoo,"Terrible pacing, good visuals, good actors, engaging premise, too anime-like to work great in live-action.",7/10,29 July 2023,"Alice in Borderland suffers from the usual manga adaptation problems, with dialogue and action coming across too similar to that of an anime, than something you'd expect from a live-action. The dialogue and characters are sometimes cheesy, with villainous laughing, huge monologues, archetypal character writing, unrealistic interactions, and the constant flashback backstories, oftentimes explaining little but offering the bare-minimum to be serviceable. In an anime a lot of the overly dramatic dialogue comes across different, and suspension of disbelief is easier, given its visual display lending to an unrealistic show to begin with. In Alice in Borderland however, it tends to come across overly silly at some points, and not in a comical way, as the show takes itself very seriously. This cringe factor would make it hard to watch this with anyone over the age of 20, despite the copious amounts of blood and gore, which obviously is not targeted at a younger audience. This makes the show sit in a very niche space to be enjoyed, and unless you're an anime fan, or a fan of Asian dramas, this might be too much for your personal enjoyment.Outside of that, the show has a lot to like. All the different survival games are very interesting, and sometimes make you the viewer think about how you might approach the problem. The visuals are stunning, with seamless CGI and practical effects, to the point where only one characters makeup had my head turning. If you are a fan of Squid Game, Kaiji, Darwin's Game, or even Tomodachi Game or Classroom of the Elite, I think this would be right up your alley.The biggest problem is how long the scenes are. I think it was dragged out way too much, to the point where I could even see each game turned into a 24 minute anime episode, instead of a 50-80 minute episode, sometimes even two 50+ minute episodes for one game. The pacing feels horrendous, and it was to the point where I sat there itching to do something else for a lot of dialogue scenes. Sometimes they manage to put 2-3 games into one episode, which feels great, but these games are usually not that interesting enough for an episode to begin with. Scenes where they have massive monologues, that ultimately could be condensed down to a few lines of encouragement, sometimes take over 10 minutes. Constant pauses and still shots of characters faces, it gets rather boring. I think the worse part is when a lot of scenes don't really serve the greater narrative, or any of the main characters. Scenarios that were basically solved get dragged out with unnecessary side characters filling the frame with their opinions. Deaths that were meant to be emotional or inspirational, are instead sighs of relief, as you cannot be bothered having this character fill up air time anymore.However despite my disdain for the pacing, I think that as a show, it's entertaining. I also think the choice in actors was great, and I've definitely found some new actors to watch out for regarding film in general. The story itself is engaging, and if multiple seasons is too much for you, I think reading the manga might be the best option here, as it would address pretty much all my grievances. I'd give season 1 a 6/10, and season 2 a 7/10, mainly because I found season 2s games to be more entertaining and logical, as well as the action to be more intense and dramatic, with more memorable characters, and giving more air-time to characters I previously liked in season 1, like 'Chishiya'. With a average of 6.5/10 as my final rating, rounding up to 7 for IMDB."
mathieu-n,Lame live action,3/10,10 November 2021,"I really wanted to like this one, but by experience I know that live action from manga are always cringe worthy with extremely rare exception. This one didn't made the cut.Bad acting and bad written character. I mean come on, you are in an empty Tokyo and you hunt rabbit in TOKYO and live in a warehouse...as much as the character only characteristics is her connection with mountain, that's stupid.Main character is not even likable, just a whiny looser.

haidaraliuk,"WatCh the first 2 and last 3 episodes, the rest can be fast forwarded",8/10,30 December 2020,"This is a completely different genre for me so I'm going to give it justice. The first two episodes started off reall strong. However, I skipped all the middle episodes to see how the games were played out. Honestly I wasn't that interest in the backdrop of all the characters though some of them added to the story line.There are several questions still unanswered for me. Why did all the people disappear? We're they transported to a different reality? It seems so.I didn't follow the logic of the last episode, I couldn't genuinely believe that a person would want to kill everyone because their friend died.Looking forward to the next season but it really has to build on the world building element of this dystopia to keep it interesting and I think the show could tailor more to international audiences.From a cinematography perspective I loved the blueish look and feel at the start and some of the rooftop blue sky shots. However, they also experimented with the orange tinge as well which was nice to view - the cast is primarily East Asian so the colour grading was adapted to bring out the skin tones.I think the show also had lots of subliminal themes eg several plots focussed on suicide, female characters had nurturing roles etc.This was a unique show, it's brought this genre to the mainstream Netflix viewers and we'll have to adapt to this different kind of story telling."
alinabiryukova-699-160770,Support the genre by rating!!!!,10/10,2 January 2023,"Before you give it a lower rating just because it was not ""as good as the manga"" or ""not as good as what I personally imagined in my head"", stop.If you keep doing that, then they will not keep making this type of content!!!!!!! And I really want to see season 3!!!The idea is awesome. The acting was just superb.I especially enjoyed all the amazing female characters! Marvel is great, but more realistic women characters are so important and fun to watch! I mean, I use the term realistic loosely simply because they don't have magic powers in this show.The fight scenes were so well done. Especially in the episode 7 of the 2nd season!The only complaint I had was : way too many flashbacks in the second season. I had to even skip some.Once again. SUPPORT THE GENRE BY GIVING A HIGHER RATING."

Unlike Squid Games it gets going from the word go and for the first 4 episodes I was hooked. Unfortunately after that it all goes in a different direction and not in a good way. Like I said in the title i so much wanted more from it and sadly it failed to deliver.

kalexalex,The king of tv series...,10/10,8 January 2023,"Westerners think squid game is the best..but they're sooo wrong...this is the real deal.. I thought first season was great but they made second season better...best cast best acting best screenplay and direction...can't see anything close to it in Hollywood ever . Brilliant just brilliant story..no nonsense no obscenities or unwanted sex scenes..you can't stop with one episode..it's edge of the seat thriller..keeps you guessing...love it..squid game is a joke compared to this... Also involves has great advise about looking at life in a different way and appreciate life...must watch ..every character is strong and casting director has done a great job..not like in Hollywood casting,where actors with no upper lip and huge foreheads and nil talent prevail..Arisu usagi keuini chishya aguni are my favs ..with crap like marvel , avatar and DC this is a real treat for ppl who crave for good story and strong acting..the best."
horwoodpaul,Would of worked better as a teen anime,2/10,23 December 2020,"Like a trash version of the cube, not sure if it's a cultural difference or a bad translation but it lacks any redeeming qualities, poor acting, effects, characters, script, plot and cinematography. Maybe enjoyable if you're a 12 year old or drunk and enjoy so bad it's good, otherwise give it a hard pass.

Down2earth,I don't pretend to be a critic.,9/10,6 January 2023,"Alot of people try and be some mad film critics when they write reviews but at the end of it, you like what you like.This shows is escapism personified. Everyone plays games that takes them to another world, well this series is just that. Behind every challenge, game or interaction is a relatable theme.It's easy watching, good fun and some of the later episodes are a good mind bending exercise.If you like series that take everything out of the normal and twist it into a weird fantasy, then this is for you. Yeah, acting can be questionable but that doesn't take away from the fact that this is a good programme and worth watching.

mabrukc,"Disappointed, it had potential",4/10,4 January 2023,"Comparing this movie to Squid Games. The actors never asked the basic logical questions about how they all appeared there in different timeframes, etc nor thought on those who they left behind. Poor logic in too many places. This movies had good potential. The acting was mediocre. Key people get stabbed multiple times and get shot at but will survive multiple times. Sometime the main characters talk between them amongst all the actions and the time seems to stand still. Somehow you know the main characters will make it to the end. In Squid Games there was a logic in how people appear in the game but here it makes no sense.I'm really disappointed, it had so much potential. Not a series of watch again.

skintone-38600,Excellent edge of the seat thrills,10/10,27 December 2020,"Loved this. Fun, action packed and totally entertaining.
I really like this kind of concept, which was first explored in the Cube Trilogy of movies.
This looks like a really fun ride so far.

louilongrenli,The last 3 episodes are cringe,6/10,12 April 2022,"The beginning has great cinematographies and a decent a plotline that is puzzling and fairly engaging. But like a lot of people mentioned in their reviews, after the casts arrived at beach later in the season, the show just completely forgot its realism and turns every support character into clueless peons. The actors at beach are also quite bad characters that defy logic and reasons. All in all, if you don't think when you watch shows, this is definitely the show for you."
vauliys,Putting Squid Game to Shame!,10/10,22 March 2023,"Don't get me wrong, Squid Game is amazing and deserves the hype but Alice in Borderland definitely rises to the occasion and hits the mark being my all time favourite Japanese series. It really show be talked about more.Every single character has a great backstory and showcases some type of trauma, I was certainly surprised to the directors include a trans character which was so refreshing as it's not really represented in today's media.For each episode there was something new and nothing was repeated leaving you surprised at each and every turn. Sometimes you even want the villains to win, that's how great the characters are.

neilbs-30623,Best show I've seen in years,10/10,14 March 2023,"I didn't really know what to expect from this show - I didn't know much about it, but the initial premise sounded interesting.I'm also not one for foreign language TV, though that's starting to change! I have this a chance after a certain wildly successful Korean show, and I'm so pleased I did.This show was gripping - the episodes dragged you in with a fantastic story, great characters and amazing visual effects and energy.I almost didn't want to watch the last episode - first because it mean an end to the experience, and secondly because I thought I knew where it would go - I didn't. Not even close.Try one episode - you'll get sucked in and love it, I'm willing to bet on that."
ayfaizah,The Series that push you to watch all of the episodes,8/10,21 April 2021,"All I can said is that this series really know how to keep me to watching al of the episode, because this series really have a brilliant opening and ending. It's really exciting from the first to second episode but feels boring in the middle, but when you reach the three episode before the ending, it's getting moreeee complicated and all you can do just watch it till the end. Because trust me, the ending was amazing haha.

Even I Watched It Twice.I Mostly Liked The Character Design, Their Behaviour And Skills - Just Awesome.And I Want To Congratulate The Cast They Performed Very Vell. Once You Started Watching You Will Feel Like You Are One Of Them...Emotion, Drama, Action Everything Thing Well Implemented.. I'm Eagerly Waiting For The Next Season To Come Out.After Watching The Series I'm Damn Sure You Will Rate It Atleast To 8...At The End I Want To Say This Is The Best Series I Recently Watched, I Will Definitely Tell You To Watch This... Thanks For Reading This Far, Hope You Got Motive To Watch The Series.. :)"
HighwindOak,"Great first half, not great second half.",6/10,15 December 2020,"The premise of this series is one which I love so I was very intrigued to watch this series when I saw it pop-up on Netflix.If I had to give it a score after having watched the first 4 episode it would have been a 8/10 for me. However as my score clearly shows something went wrong after episode 4.Personally the second half is when I felt the series starting loosing what was great about the first 4 episodes. Not to go into any spoilers, but it introduces new elements to the story that could be interesting but just feels out-of-place in my opinion. I think it could be done and I don't think it was necessarily horrible, however this is where I started to feel that the story lost its focus.However the big problem with this series is the last 2 episodes. Especially the last one. Obviously since it's the end I can't go into too much detail but what I will say is that story becomes rather ridiculous. And this is something considering what the story really is from the beginning. But it goes from being more of a mystery and figuring out what is happening to just be full-blown action and craziness. Also the acting and dialog becomes very over the top. The big reveal that we get at the end is not really satisfying, it just left me disappointed and mad about the potential this series had.Still I wouldn't call this show bad, im still giving it a 6/10 since the first 4 episodes were great, ep5/6 was okay, and 7/8 was bad, which I average out to about a 6.If you are asking yourself if you should watch this show then I would say that if you like the concept and these types of shows then it's a good bingeable show for a weekend. Since it's only 8 episode it doesn't take too much time to watch it through. But if you aren't feeling it after the first episodes then you can stop since it won't get better from there."
laurentbauwin,When Lost meets Battle Royale,9/10,18 January 2021,"Let's make it clear, it won't appeal to everyone. This is not an easy watching show, first because of the violence of the theme and second because of the culture of the Japanese culture.For those would stand the first and like the second your are up for a hell of a good time. This is pure madness of a alternative dimension where some inhabitants of Tokyo are send to play deadly games where the only reward is just the possibility to live a few days more. Expect lots of gruesome deaths and plot twists that will keep you want for more. The caracter development is excellent and you may even fell sad when some people die (mention to episode 3)It is true that the show does not give many answers but you get a cliffhanger that will you want for more.A must for binge watching during a weekend"
mariousa-54084,Awesome adaption,10/10,20 December 2020,"Love the show .... great preformed from all the actors

AdityaShankar0901,Starts well but gets boring,7/10,3 August 2022,"Starts well but after the 5th or 6th episode, it offers nothing new to see. I liked the first few games that were better, deadlier, and more intricate than Squid Game. But the series deviates from games and slowly focuses on the 'Beach'. That's where I lost all interest. It doesn't offer much for someone interested in the game itself rather than the environment. Almost all characters are annoying. Production Values are great.In short: This is not bad, it is way overrated.

david-wurzel,Way too japanese,2/10,18 December 2020,"I think the fact that I hated it so much is because I'm not used to the Japanese acting style. It's so over the top all the time. If you're not into anime you might hate it as well. The script is full of cringe and the screaming is so annoying. Almost unbearable. Good effects, but that's it. I really don't understand the rating to be honest.

jy-93238,So many deaths,7/10,25 December 2020,"A lot of people die and at some point it gets to be so often that it is repugnant. But that's the whole point of the show. And the kid, Chota cries every ten seconds. His voice is also kinda annoying. And I was kinda happy he got the boot. Those are my gripes. Other than that it's interesting and probably a better manga adaptation than most."
marrablaise,Dont waste your time and watch Squid Game,2/10,23 April 2022,"I wasn't even a little bit impressed. Only the main character knew how to act but even saying that feels like I'm giving him too much credit. I was not attached to a single character and even when we finally figured out who one of the major game operator was, I wasn't even shocked because the drama made no effort to make any character memorable so I was like « who tf is even this lmao » Don't bother with this just watch Squid Game. Only reason why I gave 2 stars was because the episodes were pretty short compared to the usual shows i watch which means I got through it faster.

levibierhuizen,What a show!,8/10,12 January 2023,"This serie currently has two seasons. The first season focussed mainly on the games. The plot of every game is good and the overall story line is also amazing. The characters are interesting and there is a good balance between story tell and games.Season two is also about the games, but the background of the characters plays a bigger role. In my opinion this is interesting, but could be a bit shorter. However, more towards the ending, these background make everything fall into place. The story line is good and the season ending is absolutely amazing. The plot twists, the emotional rollercoaster. Truly a creative ending.The characters develop during the serie.

rithdreydenr,ALICE IN BORING-LAND,3/10,1 January 2023,"This television series was obviously marketed towards a youth audience. The graphic visuals and dialogue can be good at times, but overall mediocre. There is no range in acting just a bunch of youths doing game challenges to stay alive which leads to a series of a lot of deaths and crying. The concept and use of metaphor to explain characters and their life choices is a good take, but overall there is not really a solid story arc to follow as to many characters are involved rather staying focus more on the main character Arisu - aka ALICE. To sum this up - this television series is pretty much like a reality game show as the creators try using the storybook of Alice in wonderland as a blue print for a story (which fails). What's really horrendous is the continuity of the story and some very exaggerated deaths of many characters. Like what WTF??? Are they dead or not dead??? And many times laughable because the logic in death is quite over the top.

leonmatthei-86173,How would you choose?,9/10,26 December 2022,"Season 2 has a very good transition to the previous season. It's not always full of action - which annoys some others - there are also quiet moments to enjoy before the next game of life or death moves on.Compared to a film, there isn't the classic curve that keeps building up, but there are always flattenings, which in my opinion, makes the whole thing even more intense.Season 2 is even more fun to put myself in the scenario of how I would make decisions but also to think out of the box and think about what would be the decisions of the others.I'm not someone who switches off and lets pure violence affect me. I want to think and reflect and season 2 did it even better than season 1.Of course, some action scenes are exaggerated, but you know that from every film/series.The connection to the characters is well done and even if you don't see yourself in the protagonists, it's interesting to know that there is always someone who feels like they have a mirror in front of them.The actors - as well as voice actors - are well chosen."

giorgosstefanidis,An intense and addictive show that's somewhat flawed,8/10,17 December 2020,"I have never been a fan of Anime . However I love Castlevenia and Blood of Zeus . I was really excited for this show because of its extremely unique plot . It didn't not disappoint . Let's start with the positives . - The acting is really good from every single cast member . - The character development is excellent . - The action scenes are thrilling . - The gore is used right although I wanted a bit more . - The show is extremely addictive
The ending is great as well . Now the negatives . - The dialogue is bad . - The show in the middle gets a bit boring . - Some CGI effects are bad . So this show is addictive and I really need season 2 now

beryldong,The ending is very awesome!,10/10,30 January 2023,"I thought this is just another version of the squid game at first, either it's controlled by super rich people or some AI or VR things. I have to admit that some games/plots are a bit long, and some plots do not make sense... But when they finally gives the answer... everything does make sense. The ending is awesome!The borderland between life and death... now it makes me think about what would happen when that day comes to me! Would I be in those games? How far will I go? Will my desire to live be stronger enough to make me go back to the real world? Amazing! Eventually it went back to ""reality"". I love the story!"
gregorydewaegheneire,Surprisingly good,9/10,14 December 2020,"After 10 minutes I wanted to quit. There was a messaging conversation going on that took minutes. On a personal note, I hate people who are all day long on their phone.
Fortunately I did not quit. What a story, what a character development act... and good actors. For me, one of the best series of 2020. Looking forward for series 2.

sameerfacebook,"It's bad, liky any other live adaptation",3/10,17 January 2021,"People rating this 10/10 need to watch some good or even average stuff to raise their standards a bit. This is bad, like wrose that live Avatar movie. Avatar was pretty good compared to this.
You are shown 3 deliquent who do not care about life, no backgroud story, thurst into a game that will make no sense at times, and the way they solve these puzzles is stupid, clues like length of car that they saw before. So who ever made these riddles/puzzles with clues, needs a paycut. They totally forgot about character growth and background story, why am I supposed to care for these people when all I know is , lady is an cold blooded adulterer who has sex for no reasons, the blond guy looks like a stick but apparently is popular and is a fighter, nerdy guy is a crier and the loser video gamer who cares nothing about life is all of a sudden Albert Einstein.
After some episodes, you will forget to care about any of these flaws because it becomes totally absurd with beach and bikins.
A friend of mine suggested it to ke thinking it was Korean like Kingdom but Japanese acting, dialogues felt pretty bland.

mtmarimele,Worth your time,8/10,22 December 2020,"For the begining i would Like to point out that as a beginner in Japanese TV it took half of the show to adapt to some of the specific aspects of their TV. A lot of the acting scenes were in my taste, way over the top and way to melodramatic. Specialy Arice on the end of EP 03. It took me apart from the show and I couldn't enjoy the scenes completely. Maybe it is because I am not used to Japanese TV culture and I know this is a adaptation from manga but scenes like that were constantly annoying to me. The acting was in some scenes Superb, but in the others it was absolutly terrible. It was laughable for me. There is a scene in which Arice explains the diesel fuel and the old motorcycle, and while he explains it, his hands look like he is holding an invisible potato or smth. Absolutly cringe ! You can say that the reason I think that is because I don't understand Japanese culture but I am not the only one saying this. On the other hand, there is plenty to like in this show, hence for my rating. Lets start with the obvious. The music was perfectly toned in my humble opinion and it set up the scenes very well. And I am no expert on music in TV shows but I tend to keep a simple rule. If you don't notice the music that much, that means its good. When I would notice a song in this show, it would be even better. I think everyone can agree on this one Secondly, the camera work was absolutly amazing. So many Great shots of nature, empty city, parks and even regular scenes from specific angles. And I am also amazed with the special effects here. They were much better than I expected before watching. To even think how much they spent on production. Impressive for sure. There is only few scenes where I noticed realy bad CGI, and the most memorable one was the sword-tiger fight in one of the games.
As i am mentioning swords, I remember the fight scene in EP 07 in the disco, if you are not planing to watch the show, at least watch that scene, it is a great, beautifuly filmed short action sequence.
Furthermore, the wrinting is also pretty good. The plot develops consistently through the episodes and it keeps you focused most of the time. Apart from the stuff I mentioned earlier, I realy respect the bold moves and twists the directiors make in the show (EP 03 is the best example). They realy wanted to show us that this is not a fairy tale world where everything ends well, but a serious place with serious consequences. Unlike the fairy tale, the Wolf can sometime win in this world.
And that brings us to games. Winning, playing, living, dying.
That was the main reason I started watching the show, and boy was I not dissapointed. From the first episode, to the last one, games are the main plot of the show. They involve your mind, your body, and your soul(heart). Some of them are easier than others but as a viewer, none of them are cliche easy answer games. Only the quick witted players such as Arice and Chershire (my absolute favourite) can break a hard game, and as a viewer you get the same chance. Visual clues are everywhere but they are not easy to spot in the first viewing. Sometimes I felt like i know all the answers but my theories turned out wrong, but on the other hand, some of my predictions of the plot turned out pin point accurate( I am not mentioning theories im which I failed miserably) .But in the end, when the game is done, the answer usualy feels obvious, but it really requiers a lot of skill. It makes you think, wwId? (what would Lucifer do? Nevermind, only Lucifans will get that joke). But no, seriously it makes you think ""what would I do?"". And the real answer is generaly: i don't know!. It is hard to think and act when your life is on the line, and your friends life too. Those kind of choices and games are this shows main attraction. IT shows you that nothing is black and white and sooner or later everyone gets in the grey zone of moral and ethic, but question is how are you gonna cope with that? Arise seeks revenge, not sure that he will get it any time soon, but let's wait for season 2.
I reccomend !
P.S. Usagi"
ryanlsj,Season 1 was good but season 2....,4/10,24 December 2022,"Gurl........what happened to season 2 man......Story telling is so lousy in season 2. For me personally, season 1 is 8 points season 2 is only 2 points. I really tried hard to stay focused for first 3 episodes. If u don't care about story line, and just to see ppl mind games then i think it is fine. It gets better in later episodes. However in overall,
S2 doest have much creative games or why they have to play games at first place. Its just Story telling is so disconnected. Also, Cant relate to characters. So much talking. Disappointing. I am not sure there will be season 3, but if there will be , hope they make something more relatable. Perhaps i had too much expectation which led to huge disappointment.

SJulien12,A mix of good and bad,7/10,14 January 2023,"This series is difficult to review since some elements are excellent while others are very bad, hence the 7/10.To start with the bad:
The acting will certainly not amaze you and unfortunately especially from the actor playing the main character.The dialogues are sometimes too long and brings nothing to the story.Many situations are not believable at all (especially a battle scene from season 2), but this problem is however solved by the conclusion of this second season.Finally, there are some lengths, but nothing insurmountable.For the good:
The musical score is great and fits the action even if it's a little bit repetitive.The landscapes are magnificent, and we don't have the impression of seeing a badly animated green screen...The character of Chishiya.This tv show manages to make us experience emotions, including shock and stress, which, in itself, is an accomplishment.Several interesting philosophical questions are addressed, albeit often in an questionable way.However, the greatest asset remains the games, due to their complexity and originality.In short, the question remains is the series worth watching? And for me the answer is yes, because I had a good time just to imagine what strategies I would have choose in each game."
badcgishark,Just a big meh for season 2,5/10,15 January 2023,"I enjoyed the first season quite a bit but season 2 really devolved into a series of stale tropes, characters with unbreakable plot armor, cheesy rom-com teen nonsense, and all in all it's just a mediocre ending for the series. I finished episode 6 of season 2 and was so bored I looked up the spoilers and...meh. I had thought that each of the characters may be dead and in some type of trial to see where they would go and I wasn't too off the mark, but it still was just a boring ending.The first season was good but to have all these characters come back for the second season....bleh. 5/10. Could have been better."
photonicsculpturalarray,So-So,6/10,25 May 2021,"A grisly production. The effects, particularly when town scenes look like models sitting on an animator's desk, are often subpar. Rather than try, again and again, to create wide views of districts in Tokyo, sans the populace, the creators might have done more through the subtlety of suggestive framing, thereby prompting the audience to contribute more through their own imagination. With a different approach to visuals and editing, this could have been an atmospheric, haunting viewing experience. Instead, the clank and din of the show's overly literal graphics served up grotesqueries, but little beauty. A production with a much smaller budget could have made use of a warehouse for a few days and served up less of an emetic.

Craigelink,Unique and well done,8/10,27 September 2021,"A unique and very enjoyable look at how humanity reacts to forced violence. I enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns. I also enjoyed having a flashback to each character's past, it had me feeling sympathy for even the worst villains, well, except creepy tongue jerk. His explaining of rape whilst licking his victim made my stomach churn, but then that's just good acting!"
zenpea,Flawed and sexist but exciting,7/10,24 December 2022,"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this show is more than a bit sexist - Arisu going on about protecting the obviously far-stronger, braver, more stable and more competent Usagi just makes the show look ridiculous.The thing that really irritated me was Usagi using a crutch on the wrong side just so she can be shown leaning on Arisu at the end. Presumably her rehabilitation doctor will have taught her that she should be using the crutch on her weak side, so she had no need to turn Arisu into a giant stick as she left the hospital. Perhaps we should just interpret that as Usagi helping Arisu to feel like he's remotely useful, as she really doesn't need him for anything.I was very disappointed by the directorial choices for the gratuitous r*pe scene too. The guy is coughing up blood! Given what we have seen her do thus far, she could have floored him in ten seconds.Having not read the comics, the show did keep me guessing as to what was going on. (And given the last scene, maybe still guessing... which is good because the S2 ending is rather under-explained as things stand.) I was hooked on some of the games, and I liked the supporting characters. But they should have wasted less time building suspense through Arisu's frustrating levels of inaction and more time building up the back stories for the wider cast. It feels like motivations are just surgically injected with a flashback needle whenever required, and some of the second season antagonists especially could have done with a bit more setup. (Also the supporting characters - what was the payoff for Ann's hike to Yokohama and back, for example?)It's not the artistic achievement that Squid Game was but it's still worth watching for all the good bits - just don't let yourself think too much about all the irritations!"
onelovek,Great start...but stumbled on a few hurdles,8/10,14 December 2020,"Perfect start and mediocre finish. The intro to Usagi was perfect. However, I feel like they rush this through. I think it needed more marinating. Have a character development, it's hard to like certain characters because it feels like you don't know them. I think great tv shows implement characters to a different standard. For example, Usagi would have been a great antidote to the mediocre performance from the protagonist. I think the mistake they made was rushing this. I like the tv show but it's not something I will say 'omg I can't wait to see season 2.' Unlike Arthdal Chronicles (Korean) which is a must see, I think it is one of the better Japanese survival tv shows out there but for Netflix standards they could have hit a home run but instead they hit a ground rule double on the first season. My honest opinion. My true rating is a 6/10 but I have it 8/10 because some of the low rating doesn't really makes sense.

7ZEN,Isekai TV series,8/10,6 January 2021,"A TV series which is both entertaining and meaningful. I watched it dubbed and in original audio, 50/50, appreciating both for their quality. The storyline is good, but what is great is the effort the show creators have put into translating an ""anime isekai"" kind of story into a TV series. For that alone, but not only, it's worth watching. Acting is good, cinematography and sound are good also. My suggestion: if you wanna taste something different, tasty nonetheless!, you can definitely go for it!
I surely hope to see a second season.

ualsodontknowy,Don't miss this.,9/10,6 April 2023,"Although the first season was a bit slow and you'd wish some parts to end as soon as possible,
The second season covers up those mistakes and gives a perfect execution of the thrill element.Both the seasons, season one majorly, are filled with Drama, so it can be boring for some while attaching for some.The roundup message/narrative of the series is one of the purest, especially the friendship between Hatter and Aguni.There are definitely some or other plotholes but they are overshadowed by the rest the series offer.The ending is PERFECT.Overall a highly recommended series on Survival genre.9.5/10."
alaaodeh1995,It could be better (I still recommend it),8/10,31 December 2020,"The idea is great. The writing was reasonable to some extents.
My mains two issues:
1- They could use a better actor for the main character - I felt the overacting with his screams. He didn't touch my feelings at all.
2- A lot of useless flashbacks in the last few episodes for minor characters which bored me.

tngwallace,Decent visuals but makes you shake your head the whole time,1/10,22 January 2023,"I watched it right after the Squid Game with Netflix recommendation but basically felt I wasted time with so much frustration. Unbelievable and illogical sequences combined with too many plot holes makes the show completely unrelatable to enjoy despite decent CGI and some interesting visuals. Albeit my effort for suspension of reality knowing the show is a manga adaptation, I still cannot believe I managed to make it till the end for any plausible explanation but ended up making me want to pound my head in after countless shaking. If you're on the fence, don't waste your time unless you could enjoy mindless action sequences with improbable story telling and no depth.

xpunisherx,Has its moments,7/10,17 July 2021,"I wish it wasn't based off a comic book. The main character gives off the vibe of an anime protagonist and it gets annoying at times. The episodes with the games are really thrilling and good but outside of the games it's just an okay story. It's goring and violent with a lot of twists, it's just the characters I don't really like. If you love anime you'd probably enjoy this show a lot more.

danieljiang-40905,Engrossing series! Definitely recommended!,10/10,12 December 2020,"While the game premise may be not new, the series is still interesting from start to finish. Despite relatively short series and many characters, able to build up interesting backstories for some of the characters very well with great effect on viewer's emotion.
The sound track and acting are good. CGI is great for TV series. So grateful to make this live TV.
Please note I haven't read manga, haven't even heard of this series before. The cliffhanger ending makes me want for season 2. I finished watching this in 24 hours. Definitely recommended!

There are many different aspects from the manga which made it even more entertaining to see!Anyway, give Alice in Borderland a chance, you won't regret it!

I like how you follow the different characters, and how you are abel to follow their stories and development. Not a single episode is biring or out of story, and the plot is really something great. Also, it's a little different to what you usually watch, wich makes it quiet interesting.The different games they have to pass are really great entertainment! - and the different cards make good sense.SPOILER ALERT!So I really hope/I'm really looking forward to what is coming up in Season3, cause now the Joker-card is on the table!"

lucasagustink,It transports you to a Wonderland!,9/10,17 February 2023,"This Japanese serie shows us how the life of some random people changes after they get into ""another world"". They will have to win games to survive and try to discover their porpuse in this ""mad world"".I personally loved this serie in all of its extention, most of the characters have a good development and you get to love some of them (altough they are not very pacific). Also the ""Bad characters"" will make sure you hate them.It's true, the plot has some argumentative holes. But this serie manages to force you to watch another episode straight away so you can discover the next game the characters will play and you suffer with them while watching it. So make sure you have time to watch this serie if you don't want to fail on your commitments until you have finished itThis serie also reflects about the life and its importance, talking about some ""political issues"" like social classes but it doesnt dig too much to get the spectator bored.I highly recommend it. Very addictive gore serie. You will love it if you liked Squid Games."
EntertheRaptor,Where is my Mind?,7/10,27 December 2022,"Interesting for sure. Sometimes it seems like this is Japan's answer to Squid Game, but Alice in Borderland does explore other topics like existentialism.I don't remember much of the first season, apart from some action-packed games which I liked. In the second season, some players refer to their time at a beach and I have no recollection of that whatsoever.Regardless, there are positives and negatives in the second season. Something which I didn't care much for is Arisu's over-the-top acting. Some of the other characters have a more calculated approach to the games which I could relate to.I must say that the last episode of Season 2 kept me guessing even after the last scene. There are some very dramatic reveals and reunions that are touching.Definitely worth watching if you like apocalyptic storylines with some romance and camaraderie thrown in.What's with that card in the last scene, though? Damn, it never ends..."

anonima-93565,NEVER ACCEPT TEA FROM A STRANGER...,10/10,29 December 2022,"Episode 8 of Season 2 was quite the mind bender.Big thanks to director Shinsuke Sato!Riisa Naka as Mira aka The Queen of Hearts was fantastic. I knew as soon as she offered tea to Arisu played by Kento Yamazaki, i knew he was in trouble..and you knew it wasn't just tea after Arisu drank it. It sent him to a place of false memories from where he was lucky to escape from. From all the physical exertion of the previous games, the last game was exactly the opposite. The way Riisa Naka described certain possibilities about their reality was mind bending and really got you thinking. Her acting was simply amazing and she had me mesmerised. I will leave you all with Mira's last words to Arisu-""Life is just a game we play together...you should try to enjoy it."""
blue-52550,Those acting and seriously,1/10,31 December 2022,"People in that series definitely don't know how to pick up guns. They better get killed than picking guns and fight back.The director really want the bad man having guns.In the first episode, they open the door and get killed when passing to the wrong room. But why not open the door and just through something!? They showed the audience like 3 minutes just before with the ID card.In that episode where the two headed horse have a uzi and they role was to kill everyone else. Seriously, let walk in speed of a turtle. Because hey, you know what, if you don't kill everyone else, you the one that die...In that other episode where they have to burn the killer of one of the girl, sure let burn all the fuel because we don't need them anymore...Whatever, I don't know what is the hype. Maybe my taste for seeing half naked Japanese chicks have changed...**I really have to get back to my review to add more comments for season 2!Seriously, I gonna say it again. We can laugh so much about American Hollywood guns movie, but this one must top the Hollywood. The King Spare, a real joke. Infinite ammo, cheat mod and god mod must be used. Get hit by a car and fire burning, no scratch at all. The dude get shot and yet, still have that kill sprint.Why is everyone holding gun like chicken? Of course, except the king of spare... Whatever, either I lost something after the covid, but this show, this show just prove it that the covid did affect some people taste..."

Although not very original, the premise is intriguing and it kept me watching and enjoying for the first 3 episodes. After that apparently, a 10 years old boy took over the script and the episodes became ridiculous...Some big flaws in the final episodes: 1) Arisu could have never joined the final game since he did not register in time 2) We hear that there are 58 participants for the final game when we see hundreds of people on the beach 3) Arisu gets kicked and punched all the time but somehow the brutal guys kill everybody but never manage to kill him at the beach"

Disappointing ending and climax is getting a little bit boring.Good flashbacks of each character's real life.Could make ending is more realistic then confuse viewers better. Virtual world will happen one day and make us think more what would be like your life. I expected to be a different ending and more interesting story.But still enjoyable to watch some mind games they went through, pretty clever making those games."

Oehaugen,Terrible ending,7/10,17 January 2023,"You should, first of all, know that a lot of people love the ending of season 2. I thing it is terrible. Hopefully there will be a season 3, to wipe out the disappointing end of season 2.You should also know that I have a love for endings, and there are not many endings out there I fully like. Despite the ending, I recommend watching Alice in Borderland. If you liked Squid Games, you will this one as well. You will, during both season wonder how this all could happen, and this build up might give you a disappointment when you have the explanation.Besides the ending, Alice in Borderland is thrilling, action, fun, sad and thoughtful. There are a lot of interesting and meaningful conversation which makes your mind travel. On some level it is predictable, but I wouldn't give much into it.Acting is good, surprisingly good in fact. I haven't seen many asian movies or shows, so I hadn't much of expectations. Filming is very good, and can't complain of the CGI.Overall is a very good show, and I would have given it a 8 if it wasn't for the ending."

matrixdukenukem,Hunger games on heroin,9/10,13 December 2020,"I went in after watching the ambiguous trailer and first of all this show is very binge worthy. I will pull you in for entire night. I was hoping this was a limited series but nope, looks like there is going to be a second season.Without spoiling anything, this story starts with three friends getting caught in a simulation type situation which goes in deeper and spreads fast. Each game was designed creatively, in a SAW like fashion where you betray some and sacrifice some. Our lead protagonists are very likeable and worthy of rooting for. They try to give important characters back story which helps us connect.Action scenes are well shot, there is some gore but not at the cost of self gratification. Character representations are tastefully done and plot points are easy to understand yet remain unpredictable to some extent.Kudos to the team, actors, DoP, sound designers, VFX team, writers and production team for such incredible work.Watch it in original language and watch this one for sure."
valentinionut,first contact.,8/10,12 December 2020,"I m now one ep left. The game is good. We get to know some background, the logic stands. Its believable.
Some hundreds of people awake in different parts of a big city as the only inhabitants. After a while it seems that the whole city is controlled so that they regulary play survival games: betray or be dead, logic escape rooms, sports rooms etc. Refuse and die. loose and die. after winning you get on the phone, everyone get one at each game, rewards: 3 says to live. or 9. you get the point. you can live only by playing.
the games are classified each by a playing card: hearts, for ex., are tough. means you only live by betraying a team mate. difficulty is obvious: from one to 10. until now nobody has seen a figure card.
when we get there with this group, youll see, there is already players and a hotel named ,,beach,, where something like a state or mob is installed. the leaders, the muscles(actually, guns) and the plebs. they figured that gathering the whole pack of card will allow one of the a free pass, a visa to the normal world.
the game gets tougher.
a good show. enterteining."
cappeca,Alice in BOREDLAND,5/10,18 January 2021,"Nice acting, nice production, horrible pacing, don't know if the story is good because I couldn't go past episode 4. If you saw Saw, or The Cube - and liked them - then you'll probably enjoy this.

DaegT,Fun to watch,8/10,17 December 2020,"It's been so much fun in watching the series. Initially I found the series repulsive due to cultural conflict. Then I gradually liked it and started binge watching it after episode 2. Yes, they put too much emphasis on the details of corpse SFX, but that's not a big deal.To me the plot is quite a simple one. The true calling is the concept of coma-in-multiverse. I have to keep thinking and watching and enjoying the thriller at the same time. That's the fun: a 3-in-1 kind of fun.I seldom watching Japanese drama and that's one that I would recommend to my friends.

govinda22,Pretty good,6/10,31 December 2022,"Binge watched 2 series within a couple of days. I love japanese series or cinema so i knew what to expect. On a whole it was ok. Quite a lot of holes in storyline, but i can forgive that as you arent massively baffled. I was saying 'well why didn't they do this...that'...but im just critical in some areas. Actors are pretty good and storyline is like manga comic. However...a massive bug bear i have is with the unnecessary sex scenes, they add nothing to the series and has no relevance to the storyline?!! There was just no need for a couple of, tbh, rough sex scenes where women are bent over or from behind, just disrespectful scenes and a teenage girl with top off and bum cheeks showing is nigh on illegal. Its too sexual when theres no need. Stop putting in these scenes it would survive without them. It put me off, and im no prude. So thats reason for lower star marking.

angel_of_death_grimmy,So much potential... such bad storytelling,4/10,29 January 2021,"The idea behind it is quite interesting and offers a variety of paths to be explored, just like a video game, even though it's much more focused on puzzles and mind games, but...:The characters are too generic, just like an anime with horrible writing and no clear purpose. ^ (I've watched over 100 TV shows & anime and over 8000 movies) Which is why I can say that Chota is THE MOST MISERABLE character ever put on screen. Every time he appears it makes you cringe by what he says or does. It would've been more humane if he was killed of in it's first 10 min.Arisu is the generic good guy from every anime that has no qualities other than one. He mostly looks into the void and at the last moment comes with a solution, just to make him special over others that REALLY try to solve the puzzle. He is mostly surrounded by morons, just to make him look special.The only one who had a bit of potential was Karube, but he made Arisu look bad so... of course he was killed of.Honestly, from where the show is now, Chishiya is the most interesting of the bunch because of his lack of empathy, which is much more intriguing than ""I have a purpose"" anime cliche.All in all, below average show. Too many errors in character development, bad writing and no interest to follow any character, other than seeing what's the answer for the episode puzzle."
lunageerl88,Amazing Gamer Fantasy/Nightmare,10/10,31 December 2022,"Full with action, drama and twisted game, with brilliant strategy to win it. I love the way it potrays the deadly game while playing with the audience's emotion in every episodes, it's brilliant!!Impressive series and live action anime i would say, considering the series wouldn't hold back on the fatal dead effects. The explaination of why all the games is happening is also acceptable, but still leave a mystery in the end of the episode to give the audience something to ponder about. The characters background stories are amazingly narrated too, without affected the main storyline.Love it!!

stuvvstores,I really don't get the hype at all,1/10,8 November 2021,"This is ridiculous TV show that not make any sense at all.Yeah I know this is manga base movie, but this is just too overacted and overrated.For example from beginning, the main character (I don't know and don't care what his name) was so easily make decisions to become a homeless instantly, the again instantly meet his 2 friends, then instantly the world change become strange, and again INSTANTLY they didn't show any shock but careless and seem happy, and again INSTANTLY they ""in"" to the ""ridiculous games"" and so on...Just forget this show, not even close to squid game at all, never ever can be compared."

ahfahmy,Brilliant season 1.....terrible season 2!!,5/10,9 February 2023,"Absolutely loved season 1! I gave it a 9/10
Season 2, I would il give it 4/10!!! Two stars from the 4/10 goes to cinematography! Everything else is just crap!Was very excited to watch season 2.But was shocked by how much they totally ruined it!The story, the plot holes, the script, the slow pace, the meaningless scenes.... terrible just terrible!!Cinematography is the only good thing in the second season.If you watched Seaon 1 and excited to watch season 2. Don't! Just don't! Or just know before watching it that it is waaaaayyyyyy below par than season 1!Again...terrible season 2!!!!"
scottsr-74835,Underrated show,10/10,31 December 2022,"I'm an anime fan who has watched 100s of animes and read mangas/light novels. I'm surprised they were able to make this as a live show for us. This show has everything to offer starting from story, characters,soundtrack... Yet people haven't rated this highly. Deserves more views and ratings. This is much better than Squid games in every aspect. Please give it a try. Happy that they successfully adapted this from manga and delivered to us. Just felt that there were not enough episodes to show more hardship the players have endured during the hard games. Hope they come up with something for Season 3. The story has lot of potential to offer if they continue with this.

rubendh,"Hair-raising, but impressive",9/10,4 January 2022,"While looking for other recommended series on IMDB, I came across this one in particular. After investigating a bit deeply, it gave me at first some ""Squid Game"" vibes, which I'd observed a few months ago and left me with a very bittersweet experience. However, I decided to give it the benefit of doubt to see how it played out. Eight chapters later, I can say without hesitation that despite not having the high popularity of its South Korean counterpart, ""Alice in Borderland"" is a superior series and by far.Although it bears some similarities with ""Squid Game"" in terms of plot despite being released a year before the latter, the difference is that the creators of ""Alice in Borderland"" planned and executed it carefully, while maintaining its fidelity to the same-named manga most of the time. As a result, the plot never fell short or felt unstable during Season 1 and the plot twists were literally brutal and surprising. Furthermore, they didn't skimp of creativity, suspense and tension factors (especially when it come to the games), something that kept me glued to the chair to see what happens next.Regarding the characters, this was perhaps one of the series' characteristics that stood out by far. The creators did a flawless job in the way they were presented to the audience, especially when they gave us the chance to see their life backgrounds through flashbacks, whether they were main or secondary. They also scored high in terms of showing an authentic chemistry between themselves (especially with Arisu and Usagi) to the point of connecting with the audience progressively and the individual character development on each one of them. Here I want to highlight an aspect and is related to Hikari's case. Although I was surprised to find out that she was trans (since I thought she was a woman all that time), the creators of the series didn't excessively focus on her sexuality or gender as it generally occurs in western series, but more on her abilities and capacities like anyone else. So I give them high props.Ultimately, if you were one of the people who liked ""Squid Game"" or felt that the aforementioned series partially met or did not meet expectations at the end, I highly recommend that you watch ""Alice in Borderland"". I assure you that you'll love it. As for me, count me in to watch Season 2."
xNecRosex,Good premise.,6/10,4 January 2021,"Season 2 could improve the overall score of the series.
It's good just not ""deep"" enough.
Acting is below average from the young actors.

writtensouls,Enjoyed the horror take on ALICE IN WONDERLAND,10/10,14 March 2023,"This review is for people who have already fully watched the series, so I marked it as spoiler.I really enjoyed the ending; it wrapped up really nicely. At first, I didn't think it would. The ending episode felt somewhat rushed, but it worked out.I like how a meteor crash was the culprit of sending them into BORDERLAND. It segues with cultish ideas of meteors, and how when you die, they carry off your souls to heaven.I enjoyed how everything made sense, like how there were so many players in the game, due to the meteor crash.The second season felt rushed, but I still enjoyed it. It took an Action genre route, which was a nice change.It was interesting how the gamers who stayed died in the real world and became residents of the BORDERLAND world. The ones that left BORDERLAND ended up living in the real world. There was a good mirror symmetry to it.I enjoyed how they flirted with a lot of perceptions, like how they brought up how all the games were reminiscent of children's games, just demented. I thought about that as I watched the series throughout.I enjoyed how they flirted with the love interests meeting after coming back to the real world from the BORDERLAND games. I knew they would flirt with the idea, and they literally had them flirting.I liked the symmetry of how they were hurt in the real world, and how that transitioned into BORDERLAND injuries. They integrated death experiences into it, like how one minute feels like eternity. I enjoyed how they integrated the concept of how people return from death experiences changed, like they were somewhere else for a while. That they had to fight for their lives, which they mirrored in the hospital.People don't see the ALICE IN WONDERLAND inspiration, but I don't see how they can't. I would recommend watching it. It was one of the better series I have seen as of late. The games were really thought out well. They integrated the QUEEN OF HEARTS and did a demented motif on heart games and cards. I really did enjoy how they took children games and reworked them into these demented psychological, gory games. You can tell they really put some thought into it."
Sandre-Monroe,Incredible !,9/10,26 December 2020,"I just watch the entire tv show!
Full of good ideas, close to the movie CUBE and evolve on his own way very fast.I do not know who are the writers of this tv show, BRAVO !A very serious, dark, well filmed / acted tv show, you absolutely need to know.

harunebudavud,What a heck is this?!,2/10,5 January 2023,"Where to start? Maybe from the first season, which I liked, actually. But for god's sake, what kind of dialogue mess is this in season 2? What kind of logic is this five-year-old, what kind of story is this?! I have never seen so many illogicalities in one series. Except, maybe, episode 3, although that itself is actually stupid, its ""Sherlock"" ending. But, the tension was ok. People, value your time, don't waste it to this nonsense from this, so call, tv show. This is actually a waste of time for NOTHING. ABSOLUTE AND TOTAL ZERO! I want my wasted time back!!! I will definitely never listen to Netflix recommendations on social media again.

No... but after 2 seasons and a great ending, I am comfortable with a 9/10.I had a hard time during the episodes to decide if it was a bad or great story, but in my opinion, it delivers!The drama sometimes gets too much for my taste, so I am really happy it ended in 2 seasons and not 10 seasons.Some characters are awesome to say the least. Some of them you hate, some you love, some you have a love/hate mix as history goes.Thank you Netflix and everyone involved in this one!"

mypaperdue,Well executed my expectation.,8/10,2 January 2023,"Overall this was a great show. Heck of a twist there toward the end, and hopefully they got a green light for a third season. This show reminds me of 3% a little bit but more full, brighter, better writing, execution and cgi. My only issue with this show is that, the writer/director seem to define to concept of ""death"" a lot in most episodes. For example, one episodes we can clearly see two characters fall in a heavy fire and possibly die but here they are in the next episode, one suffer major burn, while the other came out without a scratch. Also, I saw a girl get stabs like 10x, lay on the floor for almost a full day, didn't bleed out and yet survive. Some of these behavior/logic define reality."
lumnicole,Kill me instead...,1/10,5 January 2023,"Season 1 was interesting though not super exciting. It came after the widely successful Squid Game that made this series looked lame. The idea of the various games is interesting so I kept watching but things just got wierder without much logical explanation. You kept watching because you hope things can be explained. Things ended on a very bizarre note in Season 1 and you don't have a choice but to watch Season 2. Honestly, Season 2 was horrible. The games were not explained well. Players just went into the games abruptly and some of the games were so draggy - 1st 3 episodes of S2 is all within 1 game. And whats with having a totally naked guy being the gamemaster? So unnecessary. Shows how twisted the Japanese minds are. They tried to play into the emotions and flashbacks into the characters background but it's not effective. The more you watch the more exasperating it gets because it simply gets weirder. The last episode was just all over the place. They tried to tell you the truth but they want to keep u in suspense too. There is only a thin fine line being creative and lame.This is definitely lame!!This is definitely the worst series I've watched so far in terms of plot development."
faithalex-73734,Why,1/10,28 December 2022,"Is started out so promising and interesting but then they managed to wipe it all away in the matter of 3 episodes. Why give us backstories to the characters (that literally served no purpose to anything) just to kill them in the dumbest way in ep 3. Not to mention they dragged it on for what felt like forever and I ended up fast forwarding through it anyway. It took everything away that was building momentum and replaced it with dumb drama nobody cares about. Instantly lost my attention and I could care less. Reminds me of sword art online. Starts good and gets replaced with bs, only this show did it much faster."
arjunm-57838,Addictive but so many lingering questions...,8/10,15 December 2020,"Season 1 was pretty awesome but questions related to the technology and temporal anomalies that the storyline is based on are never really addressed.

Anyone who's every watched battle royal will enjoy this. The brutality isn't as in your face and graphic as battle royal, but Its still not lacking in that department. Every episode ends with more questions then answer (in a lost kinda way) but it will keep you watching. I highly recommend. I'm looking forward to season 2.

pro-41630,Best Show Ever,10/10,26 December 2022,"If you thought season one was good, season two manages to exceed expectations. There is much more thorough character development and exploration into relationships between characters. Each game usually spans multiple episodes, but it never feels dragged out. There seems to be a greater purpose for each game than in season one. Without spoiling too much, the final episode is extremely well executed. There is so much emotion, and in such a wide variety. The last seconds of the season seemed to tarnish a bit of what happened prior (you'll know what I mean when you get there), but I'm sure they are just leaving their options open.Overall, I think those that liked season one will love season two. It's hard not to give a lot away, but I'll just say I could understand the motivations behind some of the new/old characters that I wouldn't have expected could be possible in season one."
jasonsgk,Solid series,8/10,6 October 2021,"I saw this before Squid Game was released and at the time it was pretty original. The first couple episodes were the better of the series, definitely lagging in the middle when the introduced the Beach. Great finale though. Really great production value as well.

jyk4100,Cringe manga adaptation paired with horrible acting,1/10,2 January 2023,"Plots and games are genuinely interesting and CG is good for a TV series.All of this is contaminated by cringy diagolues and narrative. Given that it is manga adapation I was ready to watch cringe diagolues; however, bad acting made it impossible to continue. They should have modified cringe dialogues given this is a Netflix series targeting international audience.Starting season 2, it is really painful to watch the main character acted by Kento Yamazaki. He makes a facial expression with frowning/crying mouth when he is in stressed, shocked, sad and it is the only facial expression he makes while playing games. I don't understand what the actor is trying to convey and what the main character is going through. Just that single facial expression that is stressing viewers like me out.... I stopped watching.What happened to Arisu from the first game who finished the game by being smart. Post first game it just goes down hill. I don't understand what is the purpose of Chishiya and several other characters."
roussou,Intriguing,8/10,9 April 2022,"After episode one you might suspect this one of those series whith a repetitive pattern in each next episode, in this case, a new game they need to survive, but this is not the case. Each episode brings new plot twists and character developments, making you want to watch the next one, the hallmark of a good series. Deserves a second season to tie things up, which is coming this year it looks.

benjlunardi,What a satisfying ending,9/10,12 April 2023,"I enjoyed this show quite a lot, especially the kind of crazy thinking behind most games and the way characters worked towards their resolution (in that sense, chishiya gets the award for sneakiest member). Some episodes were really close to perfection in my opinion (looking at you 1.3 - 2.3 - 2.7). I do have a few issues with the pacing of the show overall though, i feel like the showrunner kept extending some scenes for the sole sake of making episodes longer. At this point in my thinking and halfway through the last episode, this show was an honorable 7 or 8, not something i would remember forever but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. But then the ending happened. And boy what a way to wrap it up, its not often i find that an ending to any piece of fiction is not lacking in one way or another. I had to sit down and reflect for 20 minutes after watching the last episode just so i could process what had happened and what it meant for the show as a whole. In few words : it was a flawless conclusion. In my book, the ending to a show has a great influence on the lasting impression I will have of it over the years. Yeah, Alice in Borderland deserves a raise to 9/10."
lemlems-374-917116,"Great idea, patchy execution.",8/10,15 December 2020,"I found a lot to love about this - the Lost/Hunger Games/escape room premise is exciting and the show doesn't pull its punches. In the main the game solutions seemed a bit obvious but I guess the idea is that in the adrenaline and disorientation of the situation you wouldn't be thinking straight.
Where I dropped a couple of points was in the execution. Some of the performance in the dubbed to English version was distractingly bad - if I could speak Japanese and watch an undubbed version then it might be different but I can't so that was an issue for me.
It felt to me like it would have benefited from being a 12 or 13 episode series - I think with a bit more time and space we could have got to know the characters a bit better and the series end could have been better developed. The last episode felt a bit thrown together and left a lot to question - in a ""Whut?"" way, not in a cliff hanger way. Plus a minor, but distracting, quibble was that there seemed to be some confusion about how many people were at The Beach.
Those flaws are there and detracted from it a little but I'd still recommend it as an interesting and exciting show to watch and I'm now keen to check out the source material."
pulkitpandey,Most underrated show,10/10,25 January 2023,"It's surprising how underrated this show is, how come so few people have watched it, this show easily makes it in my TOP 5 series and ranks higher than ""breaking bad"". This series has the capability of keeping u on the extreme edge/ extremely suspenseful, its full of emotions and even keeps you awake for the night, it's impossible to leave the series in between, and the direction is worth the appreciation, let's not forget the casting which is just fantastic given NETFLIX reputation of anime adaption, I think they have done an outstanding job this time. I consider it to be the best apocalyptic show with a satisfying ending, this might just be the best series ever. :-D.

lawrencep0,Escape rooms meet Saw,10/10,18 January 2021,"If you like escape rooms and Saw then you will love this!For the uninitiated that means shock and ingenuity in abundance together with an overarching mystery and sense of being manipulated by a malevolent mastermind. Also, the inspiring (or escapist) sense in which dropouts (or just ordinary people) can, given the right circumstances, become remarkable people whilst others fail.Engaging characters with existential angst. What is there not to love!Dubbed rather than subtitled but done well with excellent voice-artists.I am not familiar with the original manga but am inspired to look it up

shsankar,I personally enjoyed the show,8/10,6 October 2021,"I've never read the manga, so I don't know how well is it adapted. The first couple of episodes were meh, but starting from episode 3, the show started to pick up. Of course the action scenes and some of the characters are over the top, however, that didn't stop me from enjoying the show for what it is. Give it a try, you might either like or hate the show after episode 3 and the beach arc. If you're too critical about plot holes and ex Machina moments, you might probably not like the show. I personally enjoyed it thoroughly. Can't wait for the season 2.

alexandermarchack,Great coming back for season 2!!,8/10,18 January 2023,"It's really hard to believe that time flies so quickly, ended up watching this show initially after watching squid game! Although it had come before it (one year) alice in borderlands is awesome and still has high stakes fun tension in each episode that keeps you glued to the screen.Again it really is just the nature of death games that makes everything the more interesting. Games are not just games when the stakes are so high! This is not unlike Danganronpa (one of my favorite videogames!). Each game is tense and the drama is real, and this was espeically present in season 2!What really stuck out to me was that final fight with the King of spades. The fight was brutal, and it was amusing watching Arisu come in after everyone fought for their life to get that man down. The way it played out was awesome!! Arisu finally getting with Usagi was a plus as well.The way the show wrapped up was done well, establishing why everything happened the way it was, and the reason behind everything. That last card was so unsettling...we'll see what the future holds for the series. It was fine as it is, and I'd be happy to leave it!Overall super enjoyable and would recommend for a manga adaptation!"
Mercent,Only good if you are new to the genre and have never read any manga,1/10,24 December 2020,"Typical japanese production: overacting, silly overeaction, useless info dump, lame scientific explainations, illogical world building that can never work, mystery box writing, over sexualisation in the worst possible situations, women as props and men as dickheads, typical villians and heros, lame twists, mindless violence...all the worst traits of a typical japanese show, you will find it here. Only people new to the Battle Royale genere, or those who have never read any manga will enjoy this.

km_imdb-704-440344,"Starts nonsensical, gets better with time",6/10,16 October 2021,"The first game in the show is a total nonsense with unsolvable puzzle that can be solved only through confusing and impossible thought process that no one in the world could achieve. How do you even start a movie/series with something totally unrealistic when later more realism is possible?There are generally a lot of logical holes with characters acting irrationally, while the whole concept of the series is based on confusing sci-fi, again with lots of logical issues and impossibilities.However, once you get through all the issues and keep watching, you can get used to the show's weaknesses and may be able to enjoy it. In the end, there are tons of totally nonsensical & low-budget shows out there, making Alice in Borderland feel moderately smart. High-budget and decent acting also helps.

hafR33,"Entertaining manga adaptation, cool with their unique ways",10/10,3 January 2021,"I love Japanese drama, i know they act differently with different culture also, so, I am really enjoying this story, acting and so on. The story is smart, eventhough personally for me to many skin show and yea Its mystery thriller and too many dead and blood seen also, but its fictional movie right (and 18+ also) so watch it properly, somehow I only focus to the story and I think Its really original, thirlls, entertaining like watching hunger games without knowing who's the enemy (until the last eps). Can't wait for season 2.

Byron1c,"Has promise, but the season finale... Urgh",6/10,15 December 2020,"Interesting premise, and enjoyable enough, but very rough around the edges. I haven't read the manga so I had no expectations or knowledge of the story or characters. It comes across as a mix of many other well known movies n TV themes. As the series goes on you see less and less of the the puzzles, which to me, was the best part. Lots of continuity/story holes.
Entertaining, but not one I'll be telling friends to watch. Good way to see some of Tokyo city without people and cars.*** oblique spoilers below ***... But that last few eps of S1. Urgh. It's like they gave up on intricate puzzles and any sense of solving anying, or even have the main characters do anything tricky or smart, or hell, even interesting. Just boring pointless violence, interspersed with jammed in flashbacks/backstory. Way too much was introduced with The Beach which seemed unnecessary, and with very little stakes to begin with, not much is gained or lost by all the dying. We still know next to nothing about the game, why they are there, etc.
I'm not even sure I really care to know after finishing S1..."

If you are under the age of 14 or only watch anime, this show is for you. If you are over 14 or have never watched anime before, do not waste your time with this show; you will be extremely disappointed.

SJW_80,Absolutely brilliant!,9/10,6 January 2023,"I don't understand any bad reviews here.It has action, mystery, intrigue and great CGI. What's not to love?I was engrossed in this series from beginning to end and binged both seasons over two days.Great main characters that you will route for right til the end!Think squid games meets hunger games.Very original. How do writers come up with these kind of ideas. This series is unique and will take you to a different world. You won't find out what's going on til the end,The only question is......will there be a season3???It does end with the possibility of another season so here's hoping. Netflix more like this please!"
erikafunyal,Bingeworthy,8/10,3 September 2023,"I really loved the show. I found the story really unique with great acting and visuals. I have seen many other movies and series with win or die games but this one really caught my attention and I literally bingewatched the whole season in a single day. The curiosity of lead characters to know who created the game which leads the whole another face of game is interesting. Of course the lead character has its plot armor like we see on the animes but its a live action of mangas so its nothing new. Though season 2 isnt as good as season one bit Im not saying its that bad, the new characters do add life to the series. All and all you will not get bored watching this show. Thats for sure! Also you will fall in love with Chisaya.

silicontourist,A Deadly Pack Of Cards In This Game Of Death!,9/10,3 February 2022,"The only annoying part of this excellent Japanese TV series is you are given no explanation, in visual or spoken form, of how - and why - it is that the Card Game of Death participants were secreted away to an empty Tokyo. Other than that this is an absolutely terrific watch! Episode 6 is the only part (to date) that was a little slow and quite meaningless but all the others are a riveting view...at different paces and twists as you make guesses about each of the main characters. A few flashbacks give you history about some of them but, the show begins with the leading actor sat playing games, on his PC, in the real world environment...until he is magically dropped into a wacky situation of an ""Escape Room"" adventure...except that its Escape City, Tokyo!One of the things I liked is the actors were all blending well together and, they played the parts of what people would absolutely be like in real life in a similar situation. There's a little of a ""Purge"", ""Hunger Games"", ""Escape Room"", ""Battle Royale"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" feel to it all. It knocks the socks off anything coming out of America (which is not hard to do these days).Play the insanely twisted mad game and stay alive, to pick up the playing card, and do the same again the next day are the simple rules; except its not as simple when you have a few wack jobs, killers and devious backstabbers playing also!Television at its finest; in Japanese and dubbed English language versions."

cedrichudson,Best Japanese series I seen so far,8/10,6 January 2023,"Excellent story and cast. I find it the games played in Alice in Borderland is unique and unpredictable which makes it fun and exciting to watch. Especially you have to admit, in real-life situation, these are the obstacles we reflect on when we try to go through each stressful hurdles. This is seriously 10 times better than the Anime and Squid Game. Absolutely loved Arisu and the other characters in this show were super interesting and all got pretty good/developed backstories that tied into the main storyline. The plot moved in a good pace and there weren't really any unnecessary slow/boring moments. I really loved the movie Battle Royale and this show definitely gave me the same vibe as it. I'm so excited for the second season. It's almost hard for me to watch other thriller dramas now because this one was just too good.

beclo-47737,Not the worst show I've ever seen.,5/10,4 October 2021,"The first 4 episodes are really good. For the last 4 episodes though, I had them on in the background while I was doing something else. Drawn out and a lot of talking. I thought it would be like watching squid game but no. I feel like you can't compare the two shows, they're different from each other. A few inconsistencies in the series but other than that I was thinking about it when I wasn't watching it.(wouldn't everyone be playing their first game together? How come some people had already played like 5 games even though the world had just shut off at the exact same time for every single person??)

ahmxii,Impressive 'trapped-in-a-deadly-game' action,9/10,8 November 2021,"There are Series on Netflix that you have high hopes for or just seems good, but end up flat on their Faces when you finally watch it. On the other Hand, there are Series that you don't have a lot of expectations or know little about, but turn out to be a really big surprise.This is one of those Series, I just tried it out and it turns out to be one of the best Series I have seen this Year. It is a Mystery-Action-Adventure-Thriller about a group of Friends who end up in a Place where they are forced to participate in Games that result in Life or Death.Each Game is unique and thus have to be solved in a relatively unique way also. The Pacing, Storytelling, Characterizations, Acting, etc. Are all pretty good, there's not a lot of dull moments in the Episodes, there's always something interesting happening.It is like squid game but its better than that. I really recommend it to those who are fan of squid game."
sameh_shazly,Amazing,8/10,22 December 2020,"These series made me watch all 8 episodes in one day , the moment first episode started i found myself immersed in it and with every challenge the protagonists go through you will feel that's it's you who is taking the challenge.
anyway it's not perfect show as there are some flaws espcially for CGI however that won't affect the whole expereince.

AviShakes,Ride full of suspense and tension,8/10,5 November 2021,"After squid game i came to know about this series. And this one is not as good as squid game but yet it has a lot of potential. From the get go, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you guessing what is really happening. But till the end you can't guess what's really happening. It is a good series with decent acting and suspenseful drama.

milesrdavis,"Came for Squid Game, Got Lost",8/10,10 January 2023,"I'll admit it. I saw this title after Squid Game, and having thoroughly enjoyed that series, I was interested. But two shows of childhood games where the stakes are life and death in a Netflix season was a bit much, so I put it on the back burner-you know, the kind of show you leave enough time to forget about it and then remember wanting to get around to it. Plan went off without a hitch and I caught the first season as Netflix was advertising the second before it aired.It took me a while to get through the first few episodes, but it built up pretty quick to binge territory after that.Most episodes are enough to carry themselves without leaning on the ""big secret"" that so many shows make a distraction out of teasing. Yes, we all know nobody knows. Wonderful. Where this succeeds is in making each character interesting enough to actually care where they end up. Not talking highbrow, artsy statement stuff; just entertaining. And the games, well yeah. Entertaining! Sometimes interspersed with too much angst and melodrama, but overall I genuinely would think about how I would play it out if I were in those shoes.The first season started a bit rough for me, but ended amazingly. The second season pulled a U-y on that, ending on a note that made me feel like JJ Abrams somehow got involved and the studio decided to cancel the whole thing before it got drawn out like the other purgatory metaphors he's spun.I would've given this a 7.5, and any time I end up in .5 territory, I usually feel an inkling one way or the other. The last shot is what tipped this from being a runner-up 7 to a solid 8.After the big reveal, and the whole thing has been revealed as a mass shared near-death experience hallucination with various plot holes, the camera pans to a scattered deck of cards on a table. As the number cards and face cards get blown away by a brush of wind, we zoom in and close on the joker. And I'm sorry if it was a serious moment or something, but it felt like them saying ""Hahaha that was the payoff ya shmo"" and that made me larf."

SofiCastle,"Had it's issues, but I enjoyed it.",7/10,18 April 2021,"I am amazed at how many people give a 10/10 grade after watching just 1-2 episodes (please don't do that) or a 1 or 2/10 complaining about cringeworthy acting and bad dialogues when they've watched subbed versions (noone's expected to understand japanese, but can you not read subtitles??)
In truth, at least for someone who hasn't read the manga, it is an interesting show with an exciting premise that falls kind if flat after our leads get to that beach. It does have a few characters that scream ""manga"" like the annoying Cheshire cat guy or, worse, the tattooed freak, but even with those the show remains entertaining and watchable to the end, even if it loses its grip plot-wise. Season 2 will be a challenge for the scriptwriters, but personally I will give it a go.

From-DK-with-love,Season 2,6/10,15 January 2023,"First of all, It's really annoyiong, that you can't rate each season. ImdB should make it able to do so.Season 1 I would rate 7/10, but season 2 I rate 5/10...so I ended up with an overall rating of 6/10Imo, Season 2 is just a big mess, really stupid games, and only a few good moments.E.g the king of Spade, at some point he can hit a person 300 yards away, at anither point he can't hit them within close range.The game a Queen of hearts (I think it was) with the little boy, it's just plain stupid. They could just all be blue, and let the Queen die. Why did the few red ones ran around in the end, when the new, they were on the loosing team?So many pointless things in season 2,"

karim-hussien,Started good but what is this ending?!!,2/10,1 January 2023,"Very good story line in the start and was very promising but ended with the most boring episode in whole human history in my opinion.The whole story was a dream !!!!! What?!After all this veeeeery boooooring dialogues in the last episode, I thought I will see the most epic twist I have ever seen in my whole life but unfortunately the twist was that the main character in the series was dreaming during just a minute after a tragic event in tokyo !!Are you serious guys?!The dream twist is very old trick used by less talented writers
You can't make all this good ideas in two seasons and end it with this very bad boring episode!!Waste of time really
2 stars for the good ideas of games only."

meepsonic,Watch Wednesday Addams instead. Alice in Borderland is so boring,1/10,1 January 2023,"I hate ""Alice in Borderland"". I pointed out that this show made us disappointing just for those who've watch the original title from the movie itself just before a Netflix series came out. ""Alice in Borderland"" is the worst series than Wednesday, and fans doesn't deserve Alice in Borderland to have a third season. Ever since when the new season came out as it overtook ""Wednesday"" ending the #1 reign for 8 weeks, I disliked it because of the adaptation and the original title itself was ripped off. It disappoints me so much, and many of us fans were confused because ""Squid Game"" almost dethroned and ""Alice in Borderland"" took the throne after ""Wednesday"".The title itself, ""Alice in Borderland"" is totally ripped off from the original title called ""Alice in Wonderland' by Disney. But pls, stop making a Japanese version of ""Alice in Wonderland"", because Netflix might get sued by Walt Disney Company, as I'm hoping not to renew the series anytime soon.I preferred Wednesday the series from Netflix and it looks like Harry Potter like she's doing fencing, playing cello, and nevertheless a Raven dance craze. Go watch Wednesday instead."

kirstendew,one of the best series,10/10,16 January 2023,Alice in Borderland really suprised me.The first season was very confusing in the beginning because you dont know whats going on with the world.However at the end if season 2 it all made sense.Its a great Japanese flick and the actors really make you root for the characters and care for them.I mostly fall asleep during serieus but this is one of the first series that never made me fall asleep not even one episode.The suspense is really high in almost all episodes.Also the actors do a very great job in portraying their characters.Some are very likeable and others can really make you hate them.Cant wait for season 3!
teodora23,Such a philosophical masterpiece.,10/10,15 January 2023,"Incredibly well-done show. Probably one of the most philosophical and addicting series ever made. This is a masterpiece. The ending was so beautifully wrraped up,even tho there could be a continuation (and I hope there is and I wouldn't be surprised if there will be one)! Despite the fact that I've seen the show twice,it still makes me question my own existence. The producer is a genius. This is one of a kind show that everyone should watch. I can't even express in words how much it marked me, from the themes addressed to the gorgeous scenery, the characters you can't tear yourself away from, even the ""bad ones"". I hope this show gets the fame and audience it deserves.

Gosh everything was just so amazing, the storyline, the cinematography, the actors they're doing amazing job. Thank God Netflix for producing this series, I can't wait for season 2 and how the story will going to be, lot of questions remain unanswered. Hopefully in season 2 we'll find out every thing.

yoshiduyen,Solid Adaptation!!,10/10,21 December 2020,"Would I recommend? Hell yes. Well yeah this series contains genres and concepts already being done before but guess what? It's entertaining. Though they left the series on a Cliffhanger which is why this isn't a 10. I left the 1 star just in case for the next season. Honestly speaking this was an manga adaptation done right, the budget was definitely good and the cast, directing and everything was smooth. Okay now onto the most criticised part ""The story/plot holes"". Okay so there might've been few mistakes near the end but you gotta understand this stuff is Fiction. I didn't even recognise those plot holes until some yall point it out so Don't hesitate to watch this! For something that ain't even affect the characters. Love how It gets better each episode! Personally I prefer this much better than Sweet Home adaptation.

SoumikBanerjee1996,This must end right here right now!,8/10,27 January 2023,"While comparisons to Squid Game were pretty much inevitable, and should be encouraged, Alice in Borderland is radically different in both thematic and writing terms.The games in Squid Game are much more mature, appear more polished, and have a universal appeal to all of them, whereas Alice in Borderland, despite having some well-curated designs and intriguing concepts, largely thrives on character backstories and their respective motivations.Even the two seasons of Alice in Borderline have differences in terms of structure and underlying intentions. The first season is fast-paced, with little to no downtime, and each of the characters has established solid ground of their own. The second season intended to go further, but did so by making the script less tight and, at times, prolonged.Don't get me wrong, I appreciated that they took the time to explore the characters in depth, and there are plenty of moments to cherish, but a bit more precision on the editing table would have made those outpouring emotions more tangible.Now it's up to the creators to put an end to this; I say don't linger when you don't have to; it's already got an almost perfect conclusion, and things must end right here, right now."
zinemamoviemedia,"It's Cool, But It's Very Fantasy",6/10,2 February 2022,"Alice in Borderland is one hell of a crazy project. From the setting of the place that is not playing, the actors are many, and the story is very good. Actually, there are already many films of the same type. Like The Cabin in the Woods one of them. And the games here are fun and meaningful. But this is too fantasy. Actually, fantasy is okay. But it's the type of fantasy that makes us think, ""I guess this is really really impossible."" How come. Stories like this usually have a character who manages everything. But because the setting is unbelievably extensive, which group can try to manage this? If that's the case, only God can do that. But actually, there is one plausible possibility and if it doesn't happen it will be even more disappointing. Namely, the characters in this series are in a virtual world, and they are sleeping in the real world. But it's okay. Luckily there is a second season. Hopefully it's much more exciting and challenging.

nsmiaroski,I don't understand the hate...,9/10,22 December 2022,"I wish I could go through the list of reasons people disliked this show and debunk each one, but that would take way too long. One thing I will say is there wasn't much that went into Arisu's moment of overcoming the grief of losing his friends. This being said, we can see his resolve is solidified when he makes contact with three men who vaguely resemble the trio he and his friends used to be. There is also where we get to understand Arisu's newly founded intention while carrying onward. Besides the common hero desire to save the world, he stresses that he's determined not to survive by letting others die. It's as if Arisu is compromising with the new reality he is forced to face."

hellholehorror,Alice in Borderland Season 1 & 2,6/10,21 September 2023,"Season 1The start of the first episode is one of the most engaging ever. Then they get into the game and everything engaging and original is promptly forgotten. It becomes dull. The only reason I'd keep watching is in the hopes that it explains the distinctive premise. But this is a series so I don't see that happening until there is nothing remotely watchable left in it as they drag the concept out as long as people still tolerate it. Then we'll get a loose ending giving no satisfaction like Lost. Or we'll get one interesting series that completes the story and more series after that where nothing happens like Westworld (2016-2022). Anyway good characters, acting, creativity but uneven pacing. Some surprising technical issues like shadows and the ugly gimbal movement.Rather than review each episode I am going to do a first season review. Overall it is pretty uneven. There are some enthralling exciting moments but there are also sections where nothing really happens. The story changes slightly through the series which renews interest. It is better than Squid Games and has more character and story. Cube (1997) is a similar high-concept film, which I still prefer on balance. The characters take so long deciding things which doesn't make sense in timed games. There is also lots of time spent explaining everything which we already understood. The effects are mostly good, the most obvious problems are the CGI animals and the bad water in the tunnel. Pacing would have been good if the series was two episodes shorter.I didn't like the conclusion to the season and don't have high hopes for the second series but I will probably watch it. It's entertaining and worth watching so long as you know that there is some series procrastination. The first season of Westworld is better than the first season of Alice in Borderland.Season 2This is very similar to the first series. Maybe a tiny bit better as the pacing is a little more consistent with some great action sequences like the car chase and gun fight. The last episode really drags on though and there are some other pacing issues throughout the series. Far better than Squid Game (2021). If you want a more detailed review than see my season 1 review as it's pretty much the same thing but continued. Thankfully there is a bit more resolution than in the first series."
mmartic-21937,Great,10/10,29 December 2020,"Loved it. Def recommended. Once you past a bit over-dramatic acting (usual for japanese cinematography), you will find that games are incredibly interesting and witty, there are some super-cool characters and visuals are great. Series will keep your attention all the way. Cant wait for the season 2.

agagkrawczyk,That's 8h of my life I am never getting back,1/10,13 November 2021,"If 0 was an option to put it would still be waaaay to high for this waste of time. Borring, no real plot, unrealistic characters, many inconsistiences. The worst series I watched on Nectflix and believe me I am really keen on watching bad Netflix.

deshaunlover,Pretty good,7/10,18 April 2022,The show is great the first 15minutes r insanely stupid. And then they bloat the episodes HEAVILY with unneeded backstory. Its unneeded because its backstories of sidecharacters that are about to die in like 3 minutes which ruins the pacing heavily.
PalmBeachG,Violence Sqldish Type of Game where 98% Die,7/10,20 May 2023,"Better than the reminiscent Squid Games, however this is definitely geared for the gamer aged crowd - and it was extremely violent in every episode without fail. If you like that kind of thing, you will consider it great I guess, but it was too violent for me. Actually found it to watch because am a fan of the ML Yoshimasa Hosoya who I saw in other Japanese Dramas that I really enjoyed his acting. Actually, I think his casting in this series was the best thing about it overall as he fit the part perfectly and was the one person who brought the most emotion to the entire series. Missed the first season, so started from that first so I wouldn't be lost in the second season. Watched it all the way through the middle of the 2nd season when I just couldn't take anymore of the violence and decided to skip to the last episode, because by this time really wanted to see the ending. The ending was weird but worth watching and got to see the ML in the final scene in how I like to see him - smiling & happy.

ravichilka,A Solid Thriller Series!!!,8/10,23 December 2022,"Starting of with the screenplay, it's amazing and fast paced.The most engaging element in this series is it's unique Games and it's rules.Simplest yet deadly, loved the premise, looks high budget movie.Acting of actors are pretty good. Especially Protogonist acting is brilliant. Justified the character pretty well.Character build looks original and interesting.Seen the season 2 finale, must say it ended pretty damn well.Background music is awesome and intensifies when an important scene comes up.Good concept, loved it.The Runtime is justified, not felt boried even for a minute.Netflix has done an amazing job with this Series."
pradeepcindidimple,Addective and binge watch,7/10,25 December 2020,"Alice in Borderland (2020)
Alice in Borderland is a survival game live action series which is amazingly done. A common topic that every manga/anime adaptation into live action fails. I mean none of them have been grate so far... This is the best wr've been given.
So many different things to look forward in each episode with unexpected twists.
Binge watched the whole season.
Highly recommended for manga/anime lovers out there.

neesarahmed,Amazing Japanese series,10/10,27 December 2022,"Loved everything about this show, the thrill, the suspense, the characters, the anticipation. Binged watched both seasons and loved every bit of it. Sure, the writing could have been better but I can't complain. The development of the characters was great to see, and the storyline was wonderful. The lead actors played out the role of Arisu and Usagi perfectly well! The supporting characters, Ann, Chiseya, Kuina and Niragi were great as well. I constantly kept anticipating what the new games could be especially the face card games. As someone who watches dramas 24*7, I was glued to my seat throughout this show. Can't wait for season 3!"
bcnkor,The cards or games to die or get rich,10/10,10 June 2022,"The bad and the good the great dilemma, where every action has a positive or negative reaction in humanity. A series where they have mixed the two sides of the coin in one game."
simonthil,japanese squidgame attempt,3/10,2 January 2023,"Starts of interesting ep1-3 but quickly becomes wierd with plotholes and bad acting. It feels like it tries so hard to be edgy and smart but instead comes of as dumb and frustrating.Plothole / Error examples:
Where did the panther go when Arisu went back in the tunnel? Did it die? Why is it not showed?How did Arisu pass all the jamming cars with the bus? Pushing them aside would get the bus stuck for sure.Why does the girl hunt for rabbits? Isnt there alot of food in supermarkets etc?The hide n seek game, the friends changing their minds sacrificing themself for Arisu? Ok, a bit cringe but WHY did the girl suddenly seem happy to die as well?Hatter being proud of his 100% success rate. Doesnt everyone have 100% successrate if their still alive? If this was a joke it was not very clear..Unarmed winning against real guns and swords, over and over. Ok if it happens one lucky time but seriously?I don't know if it's something I'm missing as a viewer, I'm not an anime-consumer, but the characters also seem so dumb and exaggerated. It's hard to care for any of them."
baanrudheddac,Really good and well made,10/10,17 December 2020,"Not many show has made me cry after 3 episode. This show is raw, brutal and exciting! If you like things like saw, escape room and the walking dead, then you will like this! Highest recommends everyone to watch this show!

sameerkumarcky,Must Watch Series,10/10,28 December 2022,"Alice in Borderland is one of the best Series that i enjoyed in 2022. Both the seasons are intense and captivating. It gives you the edge of the seat experience. The season 2 is one inch higher than that of the season 1. I really enjoyed the 7th episode most. But the end of the series is not satisfying to me. I mean the way show ended it promised that a new fresh season will also come where the story will continue. All the characters are quite interesting and I literally fell in love with the characters of osagi , chisiya , and the lead character. All have done their work perfectly. Their performances was too notch. Hope Netflix will renew this season .Waiting for Season 3....

ktqfpsn,Fantastic,10/10,16 January 2023,"Amazing series! The storyline, effects, acting and of course, the games were brilliant. I started watching this show after trying to find something similar to Squid Game but I believe Alice in borderland is much better. I hope they do a third series which doesn't ruin the first two! Some moments seem a little strange and confusing but all is explained towards the end. The back stories of each character are kept to a minimum and not drawn out like in other series. There are plenty of tear-jerking moments and edge-of-your-seat moments which I enjoyed. Every episode I watched made me craving for more. Give it a go, and stick with it, you'll be surprised how good it is!

stupidnamexxx,Big disappointment,1/10,26 December 2022,"Oh dear lord, I see people saying it goes downhill from episode 4 onwards, but I haven't even made it there. So much unnecessary filler scenes and cliche dramatization. None of the wit, outsmarting opponents, or breaking the game that I would expect from the genre. This is just gore.Some say the games are interesting. I don't see what's so interesting about hide and seek, where everyone besides the catcher dies. Of course, the main character happens to be the catcher, and some lame drama happens. Just seems like a pretty convenient way to kill off everyone except the main character. Not sure what's so interesting about tag with machine guns either.So disappointing."
parlay-52895,More of this please!,9/10,25 August 2023,"A great series, with a story that could of been expanded well beyond the original anime.Some strong characters supported by a story that just wants you to keep on watching. Each episode could easily be a standalone film due to the creativity and mad imagination behind it. Since I watched the first season I've been searching for other shows similar and none of those other shows have come close to reaching the level of this.I thoroughly enjoyed it and have watched both seasons twice so far and have my fingers crossed that they can bring out a third season and go beyond the anime originals. Give it a go and you won't be disappointed.

AParkinson-2,Enjoy for what this is,8/10,12 January 2021,"If you loved Independence Day despite the infinite problems and plot holes, then this is in a similar fashion. If you dont want to think too hard this is quite enjoyable. The unknown keep the story moving along nicely. The 'games' are the star of the show. They make you want to solve them. I mean in E8 how many people spent a lot of the time wondering who the 'witch' was. If you did then this show was made for you.

samuelmass,Superb Gaming Action Series,10/10,30 September 2023,"I really enjoyed this series. It's a complete Action packed gaming series. The characters in this series were too good and I really liked them. It's really better than Squid game. I wasn't sat comfortably while watching it. That's why lots of people called it as a Seat-edging series. Season 2 is better than season 1. I think this is the only series which have the capability to get 10/10 rating everywhere. I'll call this series as "" The series of Excellence "" cause it deserves it. Even adoloscents can also see it without doubt.And Finally the elements in this series are awesome and I'm happy to watch season 3 which is going to be have more entertainment than the previous ones..

jeroen-106,Starts out great but turns into a mess.,5/10,17 June 2023,"Sure, here is a brief review:Alice in Borderland presents a highly engaging premise right out the gate. Its unique blend of survival, psychological, and thriller elements makes it an enticing watch. The first few episodes do a great job of introducing a dystopian, empty Tokyo and the life-or-death games that the characters must play, all of which build up an intriguing mystique around the show.However, the show does falter when the characters reach ""The Beach"". The acting from several members of the crew in this section feels exaggerated and detracts from the overall believability. Moreover, this part of the series seems to be where the earlier established mystique begins to diminish.There are also a number of plot holes which could break the immersion for some viewers. For instance, the series makes it clear that no devices with chips are working in this alternate world, but two characters are later shown using a phone to document their journey. Similarly, a character removes a bullet from a body and claims it matches their weapons, a scenario that feels unrealistic and not thoroughly thought out.To sum up, while Alice in Borderland is certainly entertaining and boasts an intriguing concept, it has its share of writing inconsistencies and casting issues. If you can look past these, there's enjoyment to be found, but it may not live up to the expectations set by the initial episodes. I am yet to watch Season 2, and it'll be interesting to see if these issues persist or if the series can recapture its earlier charm."

dracoqc,"Good but awkward, try to listen to it like an anime",8/10,1 May 2022,"A lot of people compare squid game to this but I don't think it's really comparable. Except for the game thing but it's like a drama vs show based on manga. So there are some weird characters who look like no one in our world, some weird reaction, action and fight sometime (often) not realistic but cool. Lot of flashback while people are fighting lol (just like an anime).Sometime, the reactions of characters are just like... why the hell he's doing this? LolBut the show was fun and we want to know who's behind all of this.

mouhnadk,Superb,10/10,13 December 2020,"We all watch different types of tv shows but some of them gives you a unique experience that you didn't feel it with the others. Well that's what happened to me watching Alice In BorderLand, I really got hooked up with the events that took place and I can't wait to see what happened next. Also since that it was inspired from a manga i was afraid since that a lot of other inspirited work ending up being so trashy especially the Netflix adapted one, but this one proves me wrong the characters are really will fit despite the fact that some of them has been introduced way to early in comparison to its manga. Overall i would really recommend you to watch it this was the first review that i have ever did in imdb, but i really felt like it's necessary to share my opinion on this.

bouamaramassi,I finished the show and i regret it because of it's beauty,10/10,30 December 2022,"This show is just mindblowing everything was perfect i wish i can foget it and watch it again i think it will be one of the best i have ever watched.The actors did a great job the scenarios were not boring but entertaining and the enemies were also bad but carismatic i think this show could smoke squid game without any doubts believe me and 7.6 rating it's disrespectful and unfair for this show this is the best.I wish everyone could enjoy it like i did cuz this show will be graved in my memory and this is serious and i think i'm done talking i will just write to fulfil this 600 gap of words.

diestange-24737,A masterpiece!!!,10/10,12 December 2020,"As a manga reader, this series has shocked me and delivered everything perfectly! The storyline exactly follows the original content without anything new or strange. Also, I just thought how crazy it was to how identical the actors looked! The whole show looked so realistic, including the strong emotions and the settings. It was able to touch my heart better than the manga in my opinion. The story progresses very smoothly and has a great balance of the action and character development. It ended perfectly at the right time but also at the same time where I wanted to watch MORE! I was only disappointed when I had to stop at the last episode :[

wichtigesbuch,UPTO EP 2 IS 8*,8/10,16 January 2021,"It's only 8/10 up till EP2. Then it goes downhill for me. Overall, it brings down the average to 6/10, maybe even 5/10 from me.
Ep2 was my favorite. I was so scared I had to pause multiple times to get through the episode. I just couldn't. The sight of being hunted down by a masked psychopathic armed lunatic with calm and controlled demeanor was utterly terrifying. That's like my worst nightmare.
Anyway, the whole setting is utter nightmare. This is like the definition of hell for me. To be forced into participating into a game of strength, intelligence, betrayal, and wits again and again with the threat of death by laser that never misses. Incredibly stress inducing scenario. I was having anxiety in the first 2 episodes."

louisahassall,Interesting but gets silly,6/10,14 February 2021,"First few episodes are amazing and really gripping but as soon as they get to the beach house everyone seems to loose logical thought and forget they have to compete in these death game's!
Characters make illogical jumps and assumptions constantly, and deliberately withholds information from the audience to create the twists.
Perhaps my biggest gripe is the completely inappropriate way everyone dresses for games they know might be physical and need to run in!If you really love dystopias you'll probably still enjoy it but it gets very silly"
Sexybabexiii,"Captivating ""game"" that leaves you in suspense!",9/10,20 December 2020,"The plot of the show is very similar to Saw series except this is not created to punish the wrong doers. It's a game of life and death among humanity. Those games are almost insane (imagine if you were one of them!) driving them to make swift decision and the right decision to survive (to win). It's really a game of wits mostly, you need to be calm and have great observations to help you through every stage.Every character seems so suspicious and you really don't have a clue who is going to betray you. You're constantly at the crossroad, trying to decipher the game and it's exhilarating for viewers in my opinion.It's insatiable watching the episodes. You yearned for more, because we are looking forward to seeing the truth behind these games. And to get answers to what happened to these people? Who created them? And most importantly what's the ending?The only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is simply because it's rated R21 but I think the gore and the explicit content isn't suffice. A little nude scene will also add some flavors to the series."

Mabkid,Crazy Survival Games,7/10,28 December 2022,"Alice in Borderland transports you to a surreal world where survivors must play games in order to survive. The catch is that these games are deadly... you can die during the game, and you most definitely die if you lose the game. There are physical strength/endurance games, team-based games, intelligence-based strategy games, and psychological games.The genre is not new. It's its own story and investigation into common themes like humanity, the breakdown of social constructs, hope and desperation... you follow Arisu, the main protagonist, through his discovery of this outrageous world.The first season raises intrigue, the second season actually gets better with the quality of games (not to mention more good-looking female characters). There are pacing problems, as it wavers between action, exploration of a character's humanity... the imbalance is sometimes annoying, but the games are pretty well done (I wish there were more games they show us)"
CurtisWall,Intriguing first season.,9/10,16 December 2020,"Three best friends in Tokyo seem to vanish from thier own world and venture into an alternate reality of some kind, where the normally densly packed Tokyo is abandoned. A dream come true for some(especially during a pandemic), however, the trio soon realize that their existence has an imminent expiration date. All they need to do is play some games to extend their stay. The catch? The games can kill you of course, and there is a time limit(every games worst nightmare). Furthermore, if the games don't kill the loveable trio, then surely the other ""players"" might.Those lucky enough to stumble across ""Alice In Borderland"" will soon find themself very unlucky, when they have binged watched the entire season during one night and crave more episodes. Like other postmodern science fiction films/series such as ""The Matrix"" or ""Battle Royale"", this season brings an element of mystery and confussion that made me want to find out more, what the hell is really going on?Amidst all we get to see pleasing, well made action scenes that takes your mind of the bigger picture. At one point a sword-wielding mad man with face tattoos fights a bikini dressed teenager with drealocks in a club with strobelights(didn't think I would see that, like ever). Survival is of course key in Borderland first and foremost. The games are tricky enough put far from impossible.It's of course easier solving them in the safety of the couch and not betting ones actual life on solving the puzzle. Well written and exciting aspect of the first season.Characters are not fully fleshed out, but this is so far the first and only season. Then again, as you could imagined in this type of dystopian sandbox, people die left and right. With that said my favorite episode was episode 07, the one episode we actually got to see some brief backstory(and also the club fight). My favorite character is so far Usagi(Tao Tsuchiya). I call her ""Mirrors Edge girl"" for reason obivous if you look at her appearance and skills.In conclusion: Great pace, entertaining and fast action scenes. Captivating plot, can't wait for season 2 (please, oh please be a season 2). I really want to see what challenge a ""dressed card"" offers."

Bad_Penguin,Season 2 Review,5/10,29 June 2023,"If you liked Squid Game but are on the market for a more nebulous scenario, a loose grasp on the concept of time, poor acting, unrealistic wardrobe choices and even worse wigs, then Alice in Borderland is THE show for you.As far as the plot goes, you've got all these people that have been brought in this Tokyo-like environment and are forced to compete in childhood inspired games with a mortal twist. All the games are being given a difficulty and a style based on the different cards of a standard playing deck (so like club, heart, spade, diamond). Season 2 sees the players trying to tackle the kings and queens of each suit in order to defeat them all and go home (which they don't know that they can or even where they are ...).The plot sounds alright, hence why I suffered through season 1, but apart from the sometimes over gratuitous violence, this show has not much to offer. Season 2 feels both dragged out and rushed at the same time, which how do you even do that? Some of the games they have to take part in start mid-episode only to end on a cliffhanger (and push people to watch the next one). But there's no good plot reasons for that, just they figured that was the best way to get people watching. Half the episodes are just the protagonist being absolutely insufferable (I hate him with a passion), and the games themselves stop being inventive or interesting after the first 2. Also who even is in charge of the wardrobe for this? Who thought that putting all the women in skimpy, unpractical outfits was the way to go in 2022?! There's this one girl that's just running about Kung-fuing her way to victory in flip-flops, jeans and a bikini top... Have you ever tried to run in flip-flops? It's just mental.I suppose I can give season 2 props for some of the scenes involving the King of Spades (the dude is a killing machine) and the first two games. But most of it could have been either condensed in 4 episodes or better developed in 10. You have to make a choice, you can't give me 2 episodes on one game and then expedite the next in ten minutes with a bunch of fast forwards and ellipses...One thing I just don't understand at all is why-O-why do people start giving philosophical speeches when there's about three minutes left on the death clock? They're all going to maybe die in three minutes unless they find a solution quick and they just start running, stop, turn around and give the longest speech known to mankind...WHY??? Can't you do that later?? There's three minutes left!! Three!!! But it seems time stops during those speeches because once they're over, the protagonists still have about three minutes left ...So yeah, like I said ""loose grasp on the concept of time"".In conclusion: the best way to watch this show is to fast-forward through all the boring bits (60%) and hit ""play"" when the action picks up."
liowik,Wow! Make sure to FINISH the second season! MIND BLOWING!,10/10,9 January 2023,"This show really takes you for a ride... I had no idea just how fantastic the ending would be! Phenomenal! Production, Acting, and Story all wind up knocking it right out of the park!This is the kind of story that you need to suspend your disbelief. And it keeps you guessing and guessing. Thankfully it all made sense by the end. Few works really make me feel so overwhelmed after watching. This felt like a extended worthwhile 10/10 movie.I guess the only detraction for some people might be how violent and gory it was. But I guess that's the bitterness of the medicine. Hope this work is recognized highly!

Glue2Screen,This is how you do a good adaptation,9/10,18 January 2023,"Alice in Borderland is by far one of my favourite series in the survival/game genre. What made this stand out for me is the stunning detail in set building, amazing well-rounded side characters, very fun set of games, superb action sequences and a near perfect ending.The art department built a very stunning and detail replica of Tokyo, down to the graffiti. As well as all the arenas for the various games where very meticulously put together. Big thumbs up for the care and detail put into this.I was very drawn to the side characters in Alice in Borderland--even more so than our two main leads, Arisu and Usagi. Don't get me wrong, the two actors did a fantastic job capturing Arisu and Usagi in the battle to survive. However, two specific characters took centre stage and really defined this series for me. Kuina and Ann both jstarted as mere background characters in season 1 but they soon became monumental for me. Kuina's final boss fight is probably one of the most epic and powerful scenes. It not only was so so so cool but it was also loaded with imagery.The friendship Kuina and Ann formed brought level of comfort in such a cut-throat world.My biggest complaint for season 2 is the how underutilize Ann became and how overly drawn out the conversation sequences were in some episodes. If I had it my way, some of the chitter chatter between characters would have been cut and in place of it Kuina and Ann given an episode for Queen of Clubs game.The action sequences in this series are such a thrill ride. You have car chases, martial arts fights, shootouts, foot chases, katanas etc. Basically a thrill ride with the perfect amount of gore.The ending is well done in exploring various possibilities of what could have taken place. Though I am very pleased at the ultimate conclusion it did take, which leaves one to really ponder.All in all, a thriller and entertaining rollercoaster ride that successfully also manages to tug at the heartstrings.9/10!"
milly903md,The Cube anyone?,3/10,19 December 2022,"It's so slow, that I barely made it till the idea of the game was revealed, and then it turned out to be the Japanese remake of The Cube with teenage boys. No thanks.Other than that, nicely filmed, the acting seems believable, but the plot is not captivating enough, or should I say anymore, because it has been done before. Main characters who are the players, then you have some expendable characters/players with uninspired and unconvincing dialogue, that obviously have to die in order to explain the rules of the game to the players, much like The Squid Game by the way, cause to the viewer it's already obvious, especially if watched The Cube."
Thotbuster,Better than hunger games,9/10,15 December 2020,"It's the best thing on Netflix right now. Must watch and I am no manga or Japanese genre fan. A bit slow at the start but I guess narration does require some context unless u jump straight to action but it picks up after that and keeps u hooked till the end. I get why some didn't like the ending since everything until then was excitingly chaotic. But I can't complain and be more excited to watch the second season. Overall it's very entertaining.

orchard-double,Good first half,5/10,14 January 2023,"Starts off really well, good pace and you get invested quite quickly. Then around halfway through it starts losing its way (and pace). By the time it got to the last episode I was wanting it just to finish, bad timing as the last one took forever. Although the last few minutes did recover it a bit I thought so it is worth seeing it through.Can't imagine I'll be watching the next season.On a side note I watched it dubbed which wasn't great and I do wonder if it would have been better with subtitles. Couldn't work out if the acting was poor or the dubbing just a bit odd and just put me off..."
bergpodium,Very Bingeable!,8/10,27 January 2021,"So, for the first time in my life I watched and liked a Japanese show. Born out of boredom moretheless I watched it almost in a day.
The story of this coming of age/action packed/slasher series centers around Arisu. A young man who's done nothing noteble with his life sofar. Gaming is what he does. As on one good day the world as he knows it stops to make place for a surreal one which is almost empty. In order to stay alive he and his friends must participate in several death or alive games. As the story unfolds the viewers get not only to see a lot of action, but also interesting background about the key players.
Once you get over the language (here in Holland everything is subtiteld) you will find out that this is a very well written and acted series. It is fun to watch and you will be as curious for the next season as I am. Highly entertaining!

davejackson_wow,10 of hearts game ruined it for me,7/10,15 December 2020,"Really enjoyed it up until the 10 of hearts game, 56 people enter the game, close to 50 people die during the 2 hours of mass murdering, and then there's 30 odd people still standing at the end.Ruined it for me because that's all I could think of during the last game... Would of given it 10/10 if they crunched a few numbers before airing the show"
britech-29462,"Excellent, that's how an anime becomes alive !!",10/10,12 December 2020,"The story is great, keeps you guessing and it makes you try to figure out what would you do if you were in the games !!!

ed-503-465183,"Violent, brutal, human, and complete. I just binge watched Season 1 and 2.",8/10,27 August 2023,"Usually I don't like to watch streaming series until they've concluded. I've been burned one too many times by cancelations. This series with its two seasons feels complete. I don't think it needs a season 3, despite the fact that they are producing one.I wasn't a fan of Japanese and South Korean films until they started producing much better stories then American or European productions. The shows I've watched out of Asia are so much better than what I'm seeing come out Western studios. This is one of them.The script, acting, and production value are superior to what I've seen come out Hollywood over the last decade or so.With that said, this series is violent and brutal. So, if that's not something you like, I'd pass. But there is also fantastic character development, and great humanity among the brutality.I'm not (or wasn't) a fan of Japanese or Korean cinema, but this and Squid Games has changed my opinion. These are really great stories, and the production value is top notch."

starowarso,Much better then squidgame,8/10,6 November 2022,"This series is much better than squid game, even though the story is a bit different. The acting skills were on point and the last episode was definitely my favorite. You also see throughout the series that each character has a certain talent that they also apply during the games they have to play. I think it's a bit weird with the cards that they have to collect, it's not clear yet what to do with them. But hopefully in season 2 it will become clearer. They say the books are better than the movies, but I personally like the series better than the book itself. Maybe because I'm not really into manga/anime. But for the rest, this series is definitely recommended and if I can give you a tip: WATCH ALICE IN BORDERLAND FIRST AND THEN SQUID GAME!"
tristansebkora,Alice's kings game,8/10,17 January 2021,"This show does a fantastic job on creating a spin on the massively popular Japanese game called kings game. The jist of the game is that the king (game master) passes orders to the players who then have to complete those orders under a set time frame. There's a variety of different types and rewards the players based on their difficulty. Thrown into this unknown world Arisu and his friends try to make sense of everything and try to find a way home. The challenges that they face are sure to interest and move you to your core with something newly interesting around every corner. This is a definite recommended for me.

sampurna-sam-sagarnayak9,Simply awesome !,10/10,26 December 2022,"Many answers you were looking for in Season 1, you'll find in season 2. A binge-worthy tv series. Both seasons have 8 episodes each making it possible to binge watch in a few days time. It's a thrill filled Japanese tvseries where people die if they lose a game. It has it's emotional moments and slowly you'll start liking some of the characters and want them to survive.P. S: I personally feel like while squid game was good, this tv series is on a while another new level. Just ignore the negative reviews and give it a try. Must watch tv series. If the starting feels like a bit slow, bear with it...the fruits that lie await will be worth it !

antCOOL-494-873829,Season 2 well worth the wait,10/10,28 January 2023,"Compare the overgrown city Scape and set peices with the last of us series... I think Alice in borderland is the clear winner there.Why the low ratings? Not quite sure on that one.Production values are next level with season 2 and the the games are as terrifying and mysterious as ever. Perfect escapist entertainment really, just suspend your disbelief and enjoy what your watching and you'll find one of the best TV series of the last 5 years.And the last episode is a rollercoaster ride and a satisfying ending, with a nice little ""is it really over??"" Nod just before the credits.Netflix really does churn out some utter trash on a conveyor belt but hidden away are some gems, wish more people watch it."
cerelacholmes,More intricate and a better version of Squid Game,9/10,2 March 2022,"Dystopian survival thrillers is a genre that is personally a minimum guarantee content for me. Take Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Squid Game and AiB...All of them are atleast worth watching once. AiB is the best of all these I'd definitely say. Right from the very first episode ( The first 10 minutes drags the narrative though ) , it grows in you and makes a better bingewatching experience than Squid Game.

rockenenglish,Living is more than just Surviving,9/10,12 January 2023,"Alice in Borderland is not my favorite show ever, but had all the ingredients to make me love it, rewatch it and give it a decent rating.The characters kept me engaged, they look great, the mystery of deceit, survival and the questions of the Borderlands keeps you on your feet.Some of the Games are really thrilling, imaginitive and perhaps could've done so much more with them.Yes, some parts are overly exaggerated (I'm still confused how Akane / 1 leg archery girl didn't die) but so are many amazing shows like TWD, GOT, Squid Games etc. And if you've watched Japanese movies/shows before, it's just their style.I love all dystopian stuff and this is definitely up there with creating dichotomies of life.The ending is a surprise and a deserved ending if it is the end?As they say, Living is more than just Surviving.Live your life to the fullest."
arispull,an enjoyable slice of Japanese weirdness!,8/10,4 January 2021,"Sure, the series echoes elements of the BATTLE ROYALE and GANTZ franchises, but this obviously happens with the manga comic it is based on, so there is no need to complain. Young people are transferred in an empty Tokyo and participate as players in twisted games, from which they either survive by all costs or die. The story takes some nice twists and turns and the eight episodes have a solid direction from veteran Shinsuke Sato (THE PRINCESS BLADE, I AM A HERO, BLEACH etc.), so they will keep fans of Japanese weirdness (for example directors like Takashi Miike and Sion Sono) happy and satisfied. Plenty of violence, gunfights, katana slashings and girls in swimsuits as well, so what more could someone want?

Emmabey,One of the most amazing series! (Way better than squid game),10/10,2 October 2021,"I watched the series last year and very soon became one of my top favourites. I recommended to people who like action, clever thinking and thrillUnlike the squid game that everybody hype this is WAY MUCH BETTER
It's more complicated it's more fan it's more clever

alkis-75209,Very fun to watch,7/10,11 January 2021,"Firstly i wanna say i'm not familiar at all with the japan culture and comics etc. A friend told me to watch the show and that it was based on a comic book. Thus, I was not really eager to watch it at all. My wife insist on watching it. That was it. The show is really fun and easy to watch, the plot is interesting (but with lots of issues) the scenery is nice. The one thing that really annoyed me at first was the over-acting of the main characters but I realized that this is the way japans actors act occasionally and it's part of the whole movie culture. As a whole it's a show with a lot of suspense and i'm really happy that a second season is going to be released.

redbythesea,Loved it but disappointing ending.,7/10,13 October 2021,"The games were thoughtful and the politics outside of them were also very enjoyable to watch, but unfortunately the last 2 episodes didn't do it for me. It didn't make any sense, just felt like a forced, cheap way out + we haven't gotten any information of matter about the creators of the game or the sudden disappearing of everyone in Tokyo."

djrmc24,What a mind game!,9/10,13 August 2023,"First off I want to make clear that I will not be spoiling this series on here. After have watched the only 2 seasons on Netflix I can say I really enjoyed this! Every episode throughout the 2 seasons is exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I would reccomend adding the subtitles to this and putting the audio to the original language of Japanese. I can say this series is action packed, dramatic, and hits the feelings in all the right places. I was super impressed with the CGI level in this for a television series. I'm hoping this gets renewed for another season as I want to know what happens next! This almost gets a perfect 10 from me but the only thing holding me back from that is it can be a little repetitive in some episodes. I can say I absolutely love how season 2 ends and if that is how the series finale turns out then I am happy with that as well. Amazing origibal series! Alice in Borderland gets a near perfect 9 out of 10 from me.

paavokorpelainen,Disappointment,3/10,19 January 2023,"Main verdict: Would not recommend.Start of the series was promising but it only gets worse as it goes on. I have not read the manga but I imagine it could be good, this TV series however is not good at all.Lack of connection to characters. Over the top acting or just plain bad acting, will make you cringe. Lots of unrealistic moments and plotholes that make you question the makers of this series. Feels like mix of a childrens tv series and a lower class horror movie because all of the unnecessary and out of place violence and forced plot. A drama that starts to resemble comedy because all of the flaws.

Think of the Escape Room or Saw movies, but inspired by Alice in Wonderland. I wonder give you more but tye show is best not knowing anything going in. I guaranteed you will not be able to wait for Season Two. Oh God Netflix don't cancel this after one season. My heart would break. I highly recommend it.

martinshh,Fun watch with many logical issues,7/10,14 November 2021,"I binged through this due to a flu infect and I liked it. There are too many illogical flaws in it to be a masterpiece though. For example:during the first game where they meet the Beach people in the appartment complex, why didn't the ""military people"" bring any weapons? There wasn't a rule to don't bring any, wasn't it?with the existance of Hearts games and the reason that you do not know before the game whether you enter a Hearts game, why on earth would you bring friends? That's complete BS.the head of the Beach, they told us ""why didn't he bring some soldiers"" after he died. Well, because of the Hearts games? Was he supposed to have people willingly die for him?And several more... also the end was too dragged out. They should have done the last two episodes in one and skipped a lot of the obvious drama. Overall it was fun, LF season 2."
farkasf-96857,It's awesome,10/10,29 September 2021,"I warched through the whole series and it's a masterpiece, there's a character development , you are pretty much unable to tell what will happen next thought after it's happened it's still make sense, unlike the boring Hollywood movies where you can tell what will happen from the first 2 minutes .All of the people's who's complain about the beach part pretty much don't understand it how the game's working, belive me if you use your brain for a bit everything will make sense .SPOILERGathering is a human thing , ofcourse the elderly people's will mostly die quickly in this world since most of the game require either sacrifice or strength. Also the beach was never a charity people's gathering there to survive and not to help.And the main reason for the beach is the 10 of heart
Heart means playing with people "" heart"" 10 is the difficulty and agame with this difficulty only can happen in a large group ."
martanavealb,Completely underrated,10/10,12 January 2023,"I'll risk my entire life to say that this is the best series that was ever made.The plot, the cinematography, the CGI, the acting, the story, the emotions, the soundtrack and, specially, how real life is: a battlfield.It is very rare for a movie or a series to make you feel like you are there. But this one, will make you feel every single feeling of grief, pain, desperation and strenght.The plot twists were always mind blowing, and I just keep trying to untangle the mystery of how this masterpiece is only 7.7 rated. This is the only series that I'll gladly rate with 10.I would do anything to watch this for the first time, and feel all the emotions I felt.

Had me going thinking it would lead to something but nothing at all. Guess it was a take on squid game since both nations have a bit of rivalry going on, doesn't even come close to squid game.

martingfoster-16813,A mixed bag but worth watching anyway.,7/10,7 January 2023,"I'm reviewing both season 1 and 2. Although I generally found the show watchable for the cerebral aspects of the games which have some puzzles involved, I didn't enjoy the mindless, gory violence at times. However the show would redeem itself with some good human interest aspects. Even these were a bit overdone though and there's loads of men crying as they have nervous breakdowns which few people would enjoy watching. I found myself watching the show at 1.5x speed sometimes to move the story along.I did find myself caring about the characters and that's a positive. I won't spoil the ending but it was a bit of a cop out at the end of season 2 with a rather pedestrian explanation of the whole show. The explanation is plausible but still not quite as satisfactory as it could be.I can see influences or similarities from ""Battle Royale"" which influenced ""Hunger Games"" and this show which probably influenced ""Squid Games"". I give it a 7/10 but enjoyed ""Squid Games"" quite a lot more."
goha-193-974276,Very bad.,1/10,21 December 2020,"The show is bad from any point of view: casting, total overacting by everyone (maybe this is ok for Japanese acting school but it was really hard to watch what's going on the screen), lack of logic in heroes behavior and script at all. The first time when I regret the time I spend for the show.

michalklebs,Squid Games meets Battle Royale,7/10,2 January 2023,"Very good first season with proven Japanese concept and characters but the more it progresses the more superficial, dragged out and annoying it becomes. Season 2 could have been covered in 3 episodes. It is clear that creators ran out of ideas and didn't know when and how to finish which is a shame. Unnecessary twists and subversions for the sake of it, some later games are far-fetched and nonsensical . Some great moments and character development but it doesn't always have to be grandiose in terms of fate of the universe and forcefully philosophical to be meaningful and interesting. Good TV with potential to be way better if story was tighter and more focused.

OET86,I liked it,9/10,19 January 2023,"Sometimes made no sense, it was childish, but overall i enjoyed watching it. From the beach point i lost the plot for a while, some games i had to really focus to understand, but it s a good series.Also i just can t understand the people around here that watch movies with a voiceover and also complain about it, it s insane, i would be very offended as an actor if after years of preparation people would asign me some random voice, just because they are too lazy to read subtitles and pay attention at the same time. It s all the governments fault, trying to make people nationalists but also small minded morons. It s impossible and should be forbidden to have an opinion if you are healthy but refuse to discover the art of cinematography with all the senses.

suleikomahamed,I NEED SEASON THREE NOWWW😩,10/10,3 January 2023,"This show had some kind of magic potion to it because I was ADDICTED. I literally couldn't get enough of it. And just when I thought nothing could beat season 1, season 2 did and it was the best thing ever. I'm now just thinking about how I would love to rewatch it for the first time again. EPISODE 8 was so INSANE like you had to catch up and consume everything that was going and it drives me CRAZY BUT THE GOOD KIND OFC😩😩. There better be a season three because the joker card at the end??? I think there will be because why did banda and the business looking man stay there?? I'm guessing they are going to create more games there??

vnk-29861,"INTENSE,THRILLING",9/10,23 December 2020,"Well planned..directed series.This one is a very good example of how action-manga should be portrayed.Even though the concept is unrealistic and has very little probability of actually happening in the real world,this series really makes us wonder if this could actually happen and makes us question our abilites and what we would do.Definetely a MUST watch.Makes you sit tight and watch the whole thing in one go.Hopefully there's a season 2.

D-Doerfler,Just Bad...,2/10,29 January 2023,"Only seen season 1, and if I rated the first four episodes, I'd give it a 6 or even 7....
Then, they go to ""The Beach"" and the next four episodes are really bad- bad acting, weak characters, lots of senseless and sadistic violence, characters being stupid, acting illogically.Sad, because this could have been so much better. The final 15 minutes of episode 8 seemed like it would get back to the interesting stuff but then the penultimate scene involves one of the antagonists just laughing like a psychotic Hyena.You can tell they're going more for shock value than intelligent story and plot. I expected better."
fergusthefish,Give it time,7/10,13 October 2021,"I truly believe that this is a good show but I feel like you need to go in knowing that it's based of a manga which is why it seems like one some times with the extreme overacting and unbelievably fight scenes.Even then I do believe that this show is enjoyable to watch and I'm looking forward to season 2.

MightierInk,Much more than mindless time,8/10,10 October 2021,"Does it require suspension of disbelief? Any plot holes? YES. Take it easy bros! It's a fun show to watch with very decent production values. Oh & being a guy, i cant complain
...lots of pretty japanese ladies here.So if your brain too tired from a crazy week at work, chill out & binge this over a weekend.

floscorp88,Great Ends or Great End!,9/10,6 January 2023,"This movie is in the same range as the Squid Game except it has a better ending, which is not as predictive and makes you think a bit more.Not everybody will like the excess of violence, blood and nonsense of these games, but they will probably appreciate the very human emotional aspect part of it such as fear, anger, joy, sadness, contempt, disgust, and surprise all these characters are going through.It also depicts well the human nature to its best and its worst such as selfishness versus cooperation.It deserves to be watched in a sense it is not only a good entertainment TV show, it has also a meaningful ending which is unpredictable.

moonracer0120,Hunger Games-style drama with a philosophical bent,9/10,22 May 2023,"Alice in Borderland is a fantastic drama that is part Squid Games and part Hunger Games. The scenes where the characters are suffering can be intense and hard to watch but if you enjoy horror you should be fine. The pacing is great and the story moves along at a good clip. Characters can sometimes wax philosophical but with the exception of one it doesn't get too bogged with existential questions. I like the games that trigger the emotions the most--it's interesting to see how various characters manage to survive. Strange that this drama didn't get the same fanfare as Squid Games when it's probably a better drama in terms of how it forces the characters to consider questions like the meaning and purpose of their existence both now and in the past.If you're looking for a thoughtful Hunger Games-style drama where the characters think deeply about right and wrong and human relationships, you will love Alice in Borderland!

saintso,Incredibly Entertaining,9/10,29 December 2020,"I've never read the manga so I can't compare that to this, but THIS was an amazing show. This concept was unlike any other show I've watched before. I loved many of the characters and how they use their individual strengths while playing the games. This was also my first Japanese drama and I was not disappointed. Overall, a thrilling drama that I easily watched in two days.

m-pomar,"Absolute garbage, even for Netflix standards",3/10,11 January 2021,"I have rarely watched something so poorly written and acted. The plot might have had interesting premises but had no solid background / explanation and lazily developed into a complete nonsense.I have the feeling the authors wanted to throw elements in it just for the sake of doing it: they did not even felt the need of clarifying anything to the viewers - many questions were simply left unanswered.Characters' decision-making is often illogical, if not completely random. Some scenes are utterly ridiculous (can you imagine teenagers chasing cars on foot over a long distance?) and, as other already pointed out, acting is incredibly cringy.I watched it until the end only to check if it gets better. And no, it doesn't."
zbdkxvw,"Not the best, but great series to binge watch on a weekend",7/10,11 February 2023,"I don't regret watching this show at all. For those who liked Squid game, I would definitely recommend watching Alice in Borderland too.Season 1 starts off great, and makes the audience hooked onto it. I pretty much liked the idea of the beach too, a bit cliché and stereotypical, but it was fun after all.Season 2 however, in my opinion, is absolutely flat and boring compared to the first one. Full of dramatic 5 minute long dialogs, which a lot of times I decided to just simply skip, cuz they felt like worthless fillers anyways. Other than the touching dialogs, the games were boring too, at least the ones in which the OG mc was participating. Basically the whole of the second season can even be ditched, the parts which truly matter are the last 2 eps.Ending: I really were expecting a detailed explanation at the end. I wanted ANSWERS. It gave me almost none. In a sense, the ending of season 2 was underwhelming for me, after all this suffering, relationships being formed, characters being developed, games being played, and time spent in borderland, I was expecting a much more intense ending. We got to know where exactly they were and (in a way) why they had been there. Still, there was no explanation provided for the questions who, and how.I cannot decide wether I want a 3rd season to get more answers, or if they should just stop right here and now, ending the show as it is.As I said in the title, the series is a great one to binge watch on a lazy weekend, as long as you don't have high expectations towards it."
alwinahorreur,"Interesting and intriguing, but could have been worked out better.",8/10,28 September 2021,"I have started this after the hype started around Squid game. It was on my watching list for a longer time, but i never came to watch it.The beginning of the series caught my attention. It has a great and interesting story line, which wants you to know more about the story. In my personal experience, I had a hard time getting attached to the characters or understand them. At some stages in the series, the development of the characters were too fast. On the other hand, some scenes and episodes were extremely slow. I think if there would have been a balance here, the series would have come off better.Overall I think it is a great series. The games in which they participate are interesting enough, but may also seem obvious while the characters obviously play dumb. I'm curious about the second season, since some questions are still unanswered. I'd recommend you to watch this if you are in for a mystery! If you are doubting to watch because of the gore, in my opinion it wasn't that bad. There are no jumpscares and you will know when something is gonna happen!"
peisherman42,It's okay,7/10,27 December 2022,"""Alice in Borderland'' is a pretty fun watch if you are one of these people who likes productions like ""Maze Runner"" and others with a similar feel.My problem with this is that is too slow, especially in season 2. Many dialogues and flashbacks are there with the excuse of developing the characters, but they're a really just beating around the bush.Also this whole speech of ""why go back home when our world is just as bad"" was interesting at first but it became sooo repetitive. Seriously, I think they talked about this in almost every single episode of season 2.But I guess the games and the charisma of some characters make up for it. In the end, is a decent watch.By the way, I strongly disagree this is better than ""Squid Game""."
raereese-70079,great for binging,8/10,5 July 2021,"I liked alice in borderland a lot, and a season 2 does sound interesting, not sure if its already out or? Im definitely interested in the manga/anime. But the plot was good, my favorite character would be chisiya by far. I cried a bit watching the episode where his friends were blown up, but overall it was great. Im sure the acting couldve been better..."
xxrobinhoxx-85401,Good but centered around 2 mediocre main characters,7/10,10 February 2023,"Okay, Arisu and Usagi are not that bad but screw me, are they obnoxious as hell. Both actors are not that great. Their delivery is quite annoying, something about their looks do not suit their roles, their chemistry is almost non existent too. Both characters are quite mid with Usagi's story falling pretty flat. She is basically surviving for no reason.I felt nothing with their romance. Nothing. The show just is not as great as it could have been had it not been centered around two characters that just are not that interesting and have no business being in love with each other.Where this show shines is in the nuance. Much more depth than Squid Game. Very interesting questions on why to keep surviving are being asked that the characters have to deal with - all coming up with different answers. Just like in life. Life is kind of meaningless. A lot of it is just suffering but what keeps us going? Why do we not just end it here? When are the games challenging you to a point where you would rather see yourself dying than living at the expense of someone else? Does anyone deserve it more? Are the real winners the people who died first? How far would you make it? Cool questions that all carry over to real life in some way.Action. This show sucks at action. This is plot armour central. That Military guy shoots like 200 shots and land like a couple. The guy shoots the car in the car chase probably like 50 times none which land on a person. That is quite impressive. The action has some of the right ideas. Execution? Nah. Do better.Besides that every other character was kind of good. The games were sick. Big weak points but the rest makes up for it."
Koracta,Feels like a real life anime,6/10,17 October 2021,"For someone who watched anime just casually and only knows the really cliché ones, this series feels exactly like one of those.From the acting to the whole scenario, it's just so over the top sometimes, it's still kinda good, but really too much sometimes.

billkmc,Action drama and fun,10/10,10 November 2021,"This was a fantastic show and kept me gripped to the end. Binged it in a couple of days and loved every minute of it. The show is exciting and keeps you guessing till the end and has some good and upsetting twists along the way. Fingers crossed I don't have to wait to long for season two.

thetrantwinkies,AMAZING,10/10,11 January 2023,"This show was SOO amazing I can't it was just SOO satisfying to watch and the acting is on point and the ideas for the games like, HOW DO THEY COME UP WITH THOSE?! I don't know how they have that much creativity to make those games up?! The cgi 9/10! It was great except for that one scene with kuina and Ann. But it was just sooo good and it kept me on edge wanting to watch more and more and more and more and more and more but I would say 17+ because there is a lot of s3x and r@pe and sooooo much blood and gore but over all it is probably my favorite show so you should go watch it right now and tell me what you think!

JambaJuiceXIV,Emotionally stunted and lame,3/10,22 December 2020,"This is like a cartoon written for 12 year olds adapted for live action. I'm sitting here on episode three watching supposedly emotional friends' memories of triple riding a bike through Tokyo, which is cringe at any age and in any script. But these dudes are old enough to sit in a bar and drink beer, which is literally the next scene. This just follows on a long list of Japanese culture stunting the growth of its youth. Is it a wonder that none of them ever date or get married anymore? They're all thinking of riding bikes with their friends at 22 years old? Oof it's just too much. Battle Royale is enjoyable corny with ultraviolence. For this, the violence is much less ultra and waaaayyy more corny. I don't recommend for anyone over 14, seriously. You'll be disappointed in the terrible script like it was written for a high school drama project.

emily_kate1,Squid Game and Dark City Combo,8/10,22 October 2021,"Alice in Borderland
Season 1Three men who all have a mediocre life to it suddenly morphing into a nightmare of games...Three young men who are fiends are finding their way in life, one going nowhere, one bored with their job and and who just lost their job whom all are still trying to find the fun in life together. When they're together, they forget their problems.Suddenly their lives change when the lights go out and it's quiet. New technology is broken, with no one in sight, what is happening!?Living in a dark city, with three days apart to play the next game, fighting for the chance of freedom and safety, they must work as a team in order to survive each game. If you don't pass the game, you die. If you fail during the game you die.Will they turn on each other or work together to survive...Escape the dark city and end the games, or forever play and try to continuously survive like a nightmare of ground hog day over and over again.Who is the creator of the game?FOUND - a room in the railway station with cameras and computers, with a bunch of random people watching on the games of the death and survival of those playing. Once thinking they were the game masters - WRONG. They were also pawns used in this game. A woman suddenly appears on the computer screens and is dictating the final games. Who is she? Another pawn?So many questions!? I believe Chishiya (the blonde male) has been relatively calm throughout the entire game... does he have something to do with it?? Is this another Dark City type film where the human population have been taken from the world to another fake world?? The biggest question is where are the lasers coming from and who is controlling them as they're coming from the sky. This is why I believe it is a fake world. Unless there are satellite type objects in the sky being controlled by computers on the ground.? Are they aliens controlling this new world?? Is it Arisu's father/brother teaching him a lesson to do something in his life?The FINALS -A deck of cards were used to depict every game's level of intensity from easy to hard and also the genre - emotional. All numbered cards are played, with the death of most players under its belt, the final players will play the remaining face cards - who will survive the final games?...Season 2 to hopefully reveal."
dzfg-32720,If you like Squid game this is for u,7/10,31 December 2022,Well I watched whole 2 seasons in 3 days I believe. That being said it can't be that bad. I reaaaaally liked the 1st season focusing on the games. The games were fun and you were looking forward to seeing who lives and dies. I might have gotten of the wrong foot with season 2 as it starts with a game which is just not cool. No cool rules no nothing. It's just like hey there's someone who's shooting everything and everyone and you gotta run away. Noap didn't do it for me.Season 2 does however contain cool games which I really enjoyed.The ending and the explainaition however is a big no for me. Sorry guys that was crap and came way too soon and sudden.
goswamikasturi,Lives Up To Its Origin Haro Aso's Manga,9/10,14 August 2022,"Alice in Borderland has a legitimate plot and is a show on exploitation of human emotions at a progressive rate. The predominant feelings of loss the protagonist Arisu experiences are revisited at various instances throughout the series.The plot builds up a bit slow but eventually takes flight to full battle mode. The fact that the games need more than muscle power to win is appreciable. (This is in fact a loss for Squid-Game). They are filled with riddles and need quick wit and endurance to see them through.I would have loved it if more game sequences were included in the series. The gore level is subtle and the little bit of CGI used isn't that well defined but it hardly affects the series' performance. Another plus, the protagonist isn't shown as the perfect specimen, which makes the viewers connect to Arisu at some level.Psst. For the fellow BL lovers out there:
Keita Machida's performance as Karube is in vast contrast to the Kurosawa san role in the rom-com BL, Cherry Magic! You are greeted by a completely fresh perspective as compared to the calm and mature Kurosawa san."
bellalauj,REALLY GREAT SHOW!,10/10,16 December 2020,"I really wasn't expecting very much from this show, but it really amazed me. It got my brain thinking and had me trying to solve things throughout each episode. I felt so many different emotions from this show and I cannot wait for the next season. This show was carefully thought out and everything falls together beautifully. The visuals were also amazing along with the character development! I am very critical with what I watch, but this show was binge worthy. Amazing!

murfwinship,Similar to Squid Game,10/10,21 January 2022,"Have you watched ""Squid Game""? YOu'll love ""Alice in Borderland"" for sure; it's Japanese with American voice dubbing, in a less annoying manner than our British cousins attempting those awkward Asian/English translations you see. The suspense is quite captivating and fascinating to watch at times. It's now very bloody, but rather relies on the acting and emphasis on hand gesturing. I think this is a winner here, as I give it two thumbs up. Cheers, and enjoy, Murf.

dramses79,Quite entertaining despite flaws,7/10,8 October 2023,"The show is quite entertaining, well-produced, has some characters you can care about, and the story is also interesting, there is an interesting atmosphere of suspense to it.But the writing could be better at times, taking some cheap plot choices or lines, or not properly explaining a few things that needed explaining, and the characters just seem not to care about that.Some actions of some characters are just very arbitrary, like Arisu completely depressed after the fate of friends and the just being ok after some violins play (in the soundtrack) and the girl says a couple of words.Anyway, still a very interesting and gripping show, if you ignore these minor issues.

nuevasjerry-09875,Expect something unexpected about this film.,8/10,19 December 2020,"I Love the TV series with short episode. The appearance of every character in the movie will not easy to determine of what will happen every episode. I love the series the writer to aid with every character, especially the main character of the movie.
A couple of thumbs up."
kriszti-39900,terribly boring,1/10,8 October 2023,"There are these life and death situations which are somewhat interesting / exciting. Most times, at least, but all in all it is a huge massacre of many 20 year-old beach bodies. They are either in bikinis to give it some spice or in two episodes a good-looking guy appeared full naked. And even so it is simply boring. Especially the irrelevant dialogues in-between. Not worth the time.I haven't finished it yet but I am not particularly interested in the outcome either. I guess it is more interesting for people in their twenties.I still have to write 46 characters for this review to be sent off, so I wish you all a great day and I reached the character limit:)

Sleidron,just WOW,9/10,20 December 2020,"I never thought a live action movie based on animes/manges would be so good. the cast was insane. I really enjoyed all the characters in the Series.

holmbergjonathon,Pure gold,10/10,20 January 2023,"Amazing series what can I say it has all the elements; deception, action, drama, killer martial arts, suspense, mystery. I am sad to see it end. If you can get past reading subtitle watch it in it original voice I suggest not dubbing. It has more feeling and grittyness. It gives you character to love and chacters to purely despise. You get a little romance so you not completely bombarded with action. In the end you going to feel so connected to the stories chacters that if the die you feel a little empty in side.There are few plot holes but in season two it start to make sense why. I wish Hollywood would learn from Japan cause they hands down understand entertainment. Time and time again i find my self watching for foreign shows and movies cause they understand what entertainment is and dont shove there poltics in it constantly. Defintly not for the faint of heart.Well off to watch season one all over again.REMEMBER At times you may feel slightly loss but I promise everything will make sence in the end and season two is a chef kiss ending that you not be expecting don't worry I won't ruin it."

rahmigvonriva,Low version of Squid Game,6/10,16 October 2021,"I previously watched squid game and was looking for a series like this. In the first episodes i thought it could get near to it. A difference to Squid game is that it is not realistic as that. People are killed from lasers from sky, time traveling be like situations and randomly all people except from the players disappear.But this is okay i think, its unrealistic like the dragons in game of thrones: it couldnt be in real life, but if the other plot is comprehenseble its ok.And this is the point: After some episodes the fight scenes and the acts are sooooo horrible unrealistic that the whole plot doesnt make sense. Best example here is a scene where people get haunted by other ones with guns. They can knock them out ( this is also veeeery unrealistic) but instead of getting their guns they are running away like the blonde girl in b horror movies and are just waiting for the attackers to wake up and shoot them. At the point where scenes like this started to occur i began to hate this series more and more. Very frustating to watch."
haji-94529,A breath of fresh air.,10/10,19 August 2023,"Amazing show. Believable characters reacting in believable ways. Main character is so likable unlike so many now days. He isn't infallible, he definitely has flaws, but in the end you cheer for him to m overcome obstacles, not for his death like in other Netflix series I have watched lately I like they flesh out each character, even the villains have stories to them that we get to explore. Extremely complex characters.Even the games are well thought out. I looked forward to what was coming next. They had complexity and variety, not just the same versions over and over againThrow in some twists and turns to keep you guessing, beautiful music score, beautiful set designs. Just so happy I let myself take a chance on this one.

chironex-43426,A huge disappointment,2/10,13 November 2021,"I watched the show right after squid game, as suggested by some friends. I found that the only thing they remotely had in common was the game theme and the asian production. They took a somewhat ingaging premise, even if quite derivative, and then dragged a bland and ridiculous episode after the other.The characters were cliché and dull, and after almost 8 excruciating hours I couldn't care less if they lived or died. Even the ""genius"" otaku main character was really inconsistent, and went from superhumanly smart (in order to justify some absurd plot twist) to umbelievably dumb, to the point of forgetting the type of the game he's in or not noticing giant clues right in front of his face. I could go on for days just listing the nonsense sequences, stupid and pointless dialogues and over the top drama.And I forced myself to carry on hoping to get a minimal explanation, a resolution, something. But it ended with another useless cliffhanger, setting up the same tone for the second season. Needless to say I won't waste anymore time to see it."
gmh-48113,S Tier,10/10,14 December 2020,"The pacing is masterful and the execution of the series premise is magnificent. I will be recommending this show to my friends for sure.

wurmoskar,Brainless cringe show,3/10,23 February 2021,"During the show you'll be spending a hell of a lot of time wondering whether the cringey and, at times, simply flawed acting, the illogical twists and weird details (nearly every girl being semi-nude during the entire show) are part of some kind of new artstyle or whether they're just part of a not-so-great Japanese Netflix Original. Well, for me, it is the clear that the latter is the case here.

scribblebytes,Congratulations,9/10,22 January 2022,"The crime about this series is that it is only 8 episodes for the first season.I usually know if I will like a show within the first 5 - 10 minutes because I respond most to character. Alice in Borderland establishes all its driving characters very well. You want to spend your time watching these people.In terms of story, the show moves at a very consistent pace. Each episode has well marked out thrills while the overarching storyline fits seemlessly into the mix.The stakes are always high in Alice in Borderland with worthwhile pay-offs. I'm excited for season 2.

dopamaxnootropics,"Come for the violence, but start crying",10/10,15 September 2023,"I haven't cried in about of year.This is not a show. This is a conscious reflection on meaning, portrayed through a dream. Alice in borderland is the definition of art, and a mental fight with no punches held back. It is a heart wrenching, emotionally painful show that absolutely toys with your curiosity, drawing you in to spite you with questions it won't answer. There is only one message to this show: hope.At its core, it is a love story. A romance. But on the surface it would appear as anything but. Perhaps it is the view of the artist that love is greater than understanding the meaning of life. And the countless deaths, the vast majority who will never achieve it.I am almost insulted, at this insinuation. For all the times I have tried and failed to love. And likely never will, like the players who lost the games. But this is a settled argument, and one I cannot defeat. Because the games are the cruelness of reality, the facade of winning, when none of it matters. The games are an illusion.I am... shocked at how they suspended my awareness for two entire seasons. Distracted me. But I am grateful for the experience. Seriously. Thank you for making this."
prashantnarayanverma,Best series,10/10,18 September 2023,"I really like it, the story and the presentation are very much well done by the makers. I am really waiting for the season 3 the season 2 suspense is 😘😘😘😘that after playing joker card is left is quiet a nice trick they have kept in their sleeve. So please release it soon(Season 3)
Very well done to arisu and usagi just don't die in season 3.All the games are very much nice and I like the chishiya game quite well because they are nice mind games in which he has use his mom is mind quiet well but and the arisu just keep trying out of emotion so i like it that way too so very well done just keep making best....

faizalazhar-62386,Baselesss,2/10,4 September 2023,"They filled it with action sequences only. No doubt the short stories connecting one episode to the next one was quite good.but in totality the series lost its reality connect..
Why the games actually went for 15 episodes and in last episode there is a meteorite collision, i mean seriously, there should have been a concept as to what caused those games in the mind of arisu to go on..he came to know about the death of his friends only after he woke up from arrest,so y those self blaming and getting over them games?Wasted so much time waiting for an answer, just like arisu, though did not get any..pity.

andrefamfernandes,Nothing makes any sense,4/10,30 April 2021,"I haven't read the manga, but it feels like a much more appropriate means for this story, being live action the entire series comes off as silly, the characters are not believable as human beings at all and every single episode you´ll have a mental breakdown wondering why they consistently act in the most autistic way possible. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE HIGH RATINGS, as I was, this show isn't that bad if you´ve had a lobotomy beforehand. The first episode shows soo much potencial but in every following one the quality drops. Soo many avenues go unexplored, soo many nonsensical decisions, its a good apocalypse scenario but the every one in it dropped 100 IQ points as soon as it started. I may be a little too harsh in this review, if you´re not one to overanalyze the decisions of every character chances are you´ll enjoy this show, but if, like myself, you cant stand people acting like they might forget how to breath at any minute then give this one a pass.

niabynoe,Ok,5/10,15 December 2020,"Despite the seemingly raving reviews no doubt written by people that would have simply just liked it cause it was japanese and based on a manga I have some faults. The series itself was not bad if you like this kind of battle royal style, genre of film than you will find it a decent watch however there are some faults the CGI is at times awful and there is a general feeling that this series relies more on shock value than it does substance. Which makes me worry about how great in the end it will be as a series we are continuously introduced to characters who we grow some sort of feeling for and then they are killed now don't get me wrong once maybe twice this can put the audience on edge and be thrilling but after a while and at the end of the series I feel like the people left I have no real connection to they seem to just be brought out the wood works with the bare minimum of character plot.

liliidali,SO Excited for next season please renew!,10/10,10 January 2023,"Wow that ending has me gripped. Honestly great show overall. The second season does stretch reality a bit too far, like having characters survive things they really shouldn't. But that is most action/thriller movies and it doesn't take away from the main plot or character development. I truly liked the way this season ended, had enough of my questions answered but also left me with my mouth gaping, ready to get more. I really liked the overall messaging this show has provided. It seems like they found a creative and thrilling way to show human emotions and will to live. The acting is also astounding, although I do hope the next season has a bit less monologues and more character conversation. Overall great watch!

victorharmast,Amazing TV Show!!!,10/10,18 December 2020,"First of all...we have to remember this is an adaptation to a manga/anime. They respect a Tv Show format mixing some of it with the classic anime character development, background and plot twist style. If you're into Japanese style tv shows and like Japans culture this will be perfect for you. If you're new into Japanese format I'll first recommend watching at least some classic anime films, shows or even reading some manga so you can understand the concept overall and the Japanese industry. This show is full of excitement, nerve wracking moments and even emotionally/heartbreaking moments. A 10/10 and hopefully they release a second season!!! Give this show a chance and enjoy it.

sumairafaiz-77119,Impeccable story writing and amazing execution!,10/10,24 December 2022,"I'm usually a really harsh critic of movies and series in general but this show has absolutely blown me away. This is probably one of the best story writing skills I've seen in a tv series. I loved how unpredictable the show has been since the start. Despite not making a lot of sense in terms of where they were and why everything was happening, the show was extremely addictive to watch. I really enjoyed how they addressed all the potential theories viewers had in season 2. The character development was also noteworthy! Their backstories and how they all relate to one another is also exposed eventually. The best aspect of the show for me was that it has alot more depth to it then you would expect. Truly this show is a work of art for the people who like to read in between the lines and appreciate deeper meaning.

manish41711,"Poor acting, wanna be squid game. Falls flat!",4/10,20 April 2023,"The whole series has tried to copy Squid Games but falls flat. Acting is very bad with weird facial expressions and overacting. Why every girl is in a bikini or skimpy clothes? That scene where judo girl fights the tattooed guy is so yuck. She suddenly develops so much concentration that she can suddenly fight him with eyes closed? Specially when she hated her father and martial arts? Doesn't make sense! Character development is so less. Giving little back detail for these extra characters seemed so ham-handed. All in all I struggled to maintain any interest. Kept on going in hopes that it will get better. Nah! And such mindless and boring killing. They kept killing to the point where it had absolutely no effect on viewers. People dropped like NPC's and we don't empathise with the people being killed. Absolutely mindless show!

diannndra,Feels like Liar Games + Walking Dead,8/10,30 December 2022,"I love this because i like Liar Games and Walking Dead TV series. The games have similar looks, feelings and tension as Liar Games, plus dead bodies of course. And the everyday is very very similar to Walking Dead, without zombies and less boring of course.Too bad, the games, scenes, storytelling, and plot in second half of season 2 are rushed, not detailed, no characters development, felt too easy and not complicated anymore, compared to previous episodes. It feels like the makers push to hard to make season 2 to be the last. It ruins everything they've built. With the pace of previous episodes and exactly the same materials, it should've been 3 seasons minimum.

rossmccarthy1990,Good show with some mind numbingly stupid plotholes,7/10,8 March 2022,"Why, in the ever living holy hell, couldn't a single good guy simply pick up a gun from a fallen enemy in this entire show. It's infuriating to watch."
janahtab,Great show!,10/10,15 December 2020,"Please make season 2. Even as a person who doesn't read the Manga this is interesting and thrilling to watch.

taragoluza,9/10 A very pleasant surprise and much better than Squid game for sure.,9/10,3 January 2023,"I heard this show was like a better version of Squid game and I definitely agree. I watched Squid game to see what they hype is all about and was disappointed and I would say it was mid at best - so if you didn't enjoy squid game but you like its genre, you should give this show a shot.The concept is very cool, the games are much more original and interesting than the ones in squid game, some characters are a bit stereotypical but nevertheless most of them are pretty good or at the least fun to watch AND the ending of season 2 was really amazing if you ask me - I couldn't have come up with a better one myself, it definitely wasn't underwhelming.The only ratings under 7/10 I see here are from the ppl who rated it before season 2 came out and that kinda makes sense - they say the first 3/4 eps were good but that it went downhill from there which I can understand, but after you watch season 2 it makes more sense and those few eps in season 1 that are ""not as good"" are a solid break from the usual theme in the whole show. I personally enjoyed that storyline, but like I said I see how someone would see it as going downhill if they didn't watch season 2.Overall I was surprised how much I enjoyed this show and encourage everyone who's second guessing if they should watch it - to watch it!"
aeonflux_666,"Really nice, but...",8/10,25 September 2021,"This would be a 10 if it wasn't for the main character's personality. I mean, it's like a depressive emo complaining and whining about life instead of trying to figure out what's going on and how to survive. I would prefer to see a different development where the character deals with what's going on with a strong mentality. Instead we have this whining little b****, and even though it's realistic, it's not interesting to see as a main character.For me this didn't work and it was the only problem with the series. Other than that it's awesome.

romeoluka,Good story,5/10,27 December 2022,"I just finished to watch the 2 seasons of this show. The only thing good is the story who is very interesting. And the different kind of games all the main characters had to do to survive in this world. The special effect are also good but after everything else is bad the acting the direction is horrible. Maybe some people like this acting but for me no the expression of the face how they run is too much for me. And the direction is was just horrible I remember one character ""die"" and they did so many shot it was ridiculous and the half was horrible we didn't se the face of the character. Really sad the only thing good it's the story who is created by the original creator of the manga

kimayapalekar,Amazing,10/10,17 December 2020,Just now finished watching the series on Netflix and cant get over it. Desperately want a season 2 .Mostly I was star struck by dori sakurada's character as Niragi. At first I couldn't even recognize him. He was so good at acting. My God 💜
jorgefontoura-59609,Squid what?,10/10,25 December 2022,"For me is fare and square the best show out there for this type of life or death games.Good characters, nice story and the games... Oh my god the games....It's the story about 3 friends you are transferred to another world, where they have to play to survive.S2 picks up where the first one ends, with the same intensity and more twisted challenges.The only thing I'm going to spoil it's look for the hearts games, the ones about deception, they are truly a work of a genius.Based on a Manga, it is for me the best of his genre by far.The first episodes are slow but please give at a chance, it's a gem in hidden and needs more recognition."
BennyStrum,Very entertaining and amazing cinematography,9/10,2 July 2022,"I never watched anime or read manga but watching this show made me want more of the genre. The acting and visuals are incredible. The plot does go a little off the rails but its still very fun and emotional show. The characters are great and the character development is also well done.

pieralexrousseau,It feel off hard...,8/10,12 March 2023,"I really loved the first season of this series. There was tension, good games, good mind games and characters that were really well done. The episode 3 is probably one of my favorite series episodeUnfortunately, a big part of that was lost in season 2... Even tho the tension is still here, the games are overall worse than previously. But the biggest problem was the characters. Almost no development for the main cast compared to season 1, and for me the biggest throw off is the unkillable characters. How do people survive hours of bleeding out with multiple stab and gun wounds. The episode 7 of season 2 is probably the most frustrating episode i've watched ever, not in a good way at all.

javeezero,From the perspective of non manga reader.,3/10,9 January 2023,"From the perspective of someone who watched the live adaptation only, this wa smediocre and cringey. The plot of the series is pretty flat without unexpected twists.Facial expressions are weird on some one the characters that it feels like they are having a hard time to pass something out of their body.For the acting part, the production could have combined the realistic aspect of life and not maintain the weirdness of the source.One great example is the weird samurai that walks slouch, and always on a crouching position. Who does that?Overall if you want some background noise while you are working, you can just play this on the background and do not worry about missing anything important."
nananaha,Deadly Games,8/10,17 February 2021,"Battle Royale was a movie that I enjoyed tremendously. It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again. Alice in Borderland shared similarities and it kept me glued to my TV.I watched Alice in Borderland on a whim because I like shows that incorporates games as a means to survival. The games are deadly and messed up and I was here for that. Granted 8 episodes are short to introduce a whole bunch of characters but at the same time but I thought the production team did well to weave in the main storylines of the root characters. You get to understand who they were and how the hell did they end up trapped in this game.I did not read the Webtoon so I went into Alice in Borderland as a brand new consumer and from my pov, Season 1 did not disappoint!The set up of the games are simple, rules and objective are clear: Survive or die. The introduction the 52 decks of cards, setting them as levels of the types of games you will play is interesting. The show also did not disappoint in the gore.I don't want to get into the details and ruined the experience of a first time watcher. I went headfirst into the show and left with wanting more. 8 episodes was too short and I needed more!I am extremely looking forward for season 2 and the next set of games!"
seancurran-09212,Excellent,10/10,13 December 2020,"Never got bored watching anyway. Brilliant music, camera work etc. I feel like the people putting it down are not being fair on the genre. its not meant to be true to life. Too me it felt like inhabiting the world of a video game at times, which is no bad thing, which is the point of manga, its not meant to be true to life, its life on steroids x 10 (which this is by the way). I also liked the character building a lot. Very much looking forward to season 2, I also finished it in 24hrs.

juztcecill,Awesome cast and story,10/10,14 December 2020,"I haven't read the manga yet still enjoyed watching the stories. I really appreciate the effort from director, staffs and the casts in giving their best; I smiled, shocked (because of Niragi and Usagi) and cried (especially in eps 3). And thank you for the smart and amazing stories coming from the mangaka, Aso Haro for making this work, and for Netflix to make this into live action. Can't wait for the second season!"
saryraffaelli,DDD: deadly dramatic developments,7/10,20 February 2023,"Alice in Borderland develops around a very popular theme in movies and tv shows: deadly games.As we can see in Squid Game, a group of main characters find themselves in an alternative reality in which they need to win various games to survive.Although I'm a great fan of this kind of plots, an element which really bothered me was the certainty that someway, no matter the game progress, the protagonists would always win the challenges (even if this implied forcings in the plot), consequently killing new characters with whom the audience may have emphasized more (for instance, the King of Clubs: we were sure that Arisu would have won against him even though he was totally losing the match until almost the end).Moreover, two important and recurring themes in the series are friendship and sweat.More in detail, in my opinion, friendship is over-romanticized in an unrealistic way: Arisu's friends literally sacrifice their own lives for him, Aguni fantasizes about killing himself because of his friend's murder...
In general, I would say that the show exaggerates many scenes, values and emotions, becoming ridiculously dramatic or too slow at times.Regarding sweat, we often see this detail exaggerated on character's faces, highlighting the strength required to go on taking part to the games.The elements of the plot are clearly explained and understandable and each relevant character is given a dramatic and traumatic background which explained their present attitude towards their reality, however, the transition between these scenes and the rest of the story looked forced to me and, sometimes, too detailed or insufficient if confronted to the relevance of the character in the show.Although i didn't appreciate the way of describing characters' backgrounds, I loved the depiction of their actual personality: each one of them has clear and distinctive traits, the dialogues are studied in detail and the spectator is easily able to empathize with whoever he mostly relates to or he would admire most: in my case, Chishiya represented the ideal figure of the rational, smart and sly survivor, who always succeeds at obtaining what he wants, through careful observation of people's behaviors and an excellent use of words.However, even though the dialogues and the messages that the show sends the spectator through particular characters are deep and incisive, I believe that the story doesn't give a realistic representation of what reality looks like; for instance, people in the series sometimes sacrificing their own life for complete strangers, which would most likely never happen in the real world.Why did I award a 7?Despite all these negative points, I empathized a lot with some characters (as the King of Clubs and Chishiya) and appreciated the ideas of the various games and how they were clearly explained, the plot in general and also the graphics of the show (a dystopic representation of Tokyo and Shibuya)."
le_crocodil,"Uneven, but rewatchable and sometimes great",8/10,14 December 2020,"Lately I found myself fascinated with japanese culture and tv, so I knew this show was coming. It surprised me to see the publicity around it and after I watched the show, I understood the amount of money Netflix put in this. I loved the atmosphere, the music and the first 4 episodes. It really looks like another world, with the same buildings and spaces, but empty, on the verge of the survival, with clinical colours. I noticed most of the actors and after I finished the series, I looked for almost everyone of those who appeared in more than 2 episodes. Their acting is different from what we are used to in the western cinema- they are more expressive in sadness and desperation, to the point they may seem melodramatic. Maybe it's a way to compensate the restraint the japanese society usually shows. As I said, I liked most of the actors, especially Arisu's friends - Keita Machida (Karube), cool and lone ranger like, and Yuki Morinaga (Chota), sweet and full of fears, and their chemistry with Kento Yamazaki. As for Yamazaki, he has ups and downs. His scenes in the end of episode 3 are magnificent and memorable, they left me broken, I saw myself in his howls. Then he goes in the end of episode 8, the scene with all the people in the lobby, and something doesn't seem real, it's all rhetorical. In exchange, Tao Tsuchiya should be allowed to do more, talk more, not be just an idealized heroine.
Anyway, I hope they renew the series. It's easy to watch, with a subject that makes you think about it and most importantly, it's a tv show with a soul."

cljackett,"Season 1, great! Season 2 overly dramatic.",8/10,14 January 2023,"Why do they always do this with shows? Season 1 is great and then they have to continue the story with some 1/2 hour over dramatic chat scenes every episode? And the ""good"" guy always gets others killed because he is the ""good"" guy.The games are excellent. The acting is great. But seriously, come on, in games of life or death altruism gets people killed. But that's the point, isn't it?It's interesting how they figure out the puzzles, and the puzzle/game scenes are what I watch this show for. The dramatic/melodramatic back story doesn't really interest me, but I guess without the backstory people would just get bored of continual episodes with puzzles/games. You need character growth and they seemed to take season 2 to grow the characters and the puzzles/games were the backstory."
jaapdeboer,My kind of serie,9/10,16 January 2021,"Netflix series are always hit and miss with a few gems in between (at least for me).
Therefore Alice in Borderland looked to me like a dumbed down action serie with a lot of drama for ""depth"".
Well... I was totally wrong. Every episode was intense with good action and story driven drama. Especially the latter is really important to me because a lot of series have drama without any goal to it.
If you like a bit of over the top action/gore, a weird plot and story driven drama, this is the next Netflix serie you should watch!

linkaliene,There was a hope.,6/10,29 July 2023,"I was impressed about Idea. Could be better then Squid Game but...... To much crying from main character. The main character is not growing in the show. All others are. And sad that others are growing and dying, except the main crying character. It's to hard to watch, because it could be a fantastic show. Plus ....main character is a gamer that should be a progress in real situation, but shows no progress. They made him look important as a gamer. But he is not doing well in the show. Didn't see a point. Love actors, they do amazing job. Even if it's not the way it started. Gamers are cool, and i think they would do much better."
titvsvespasian,"Very bad acting, worst screenplay",1/10,27 December 2022,"I am still amazed how they just sacrificed a great idea for a show. Acting is one of the worst possible, but the script seems to be written by a 10 years old kid: dialogue makes no sense most of the time, arguments are laughable at best and the decisions are always between bad and worst for every single character.First season I followed as I couldn't watch Squid Game anymore, for pretty much the same reasons. This show looked considerably better. However, in season 2 I was just fascinated how everything went down. They just killed a great idea and I really hope someone will remake it better...

For example, when everyone looked for murderer, they just need to watch surveillance cameras and instead of it they really thought a couple of hours who is really murderer."

maresp9,Great series!,10/10,16 December 2020,"Outstanding is the acting of Yamazaki Kento in this series. The plot moves fast enough to not feel bored and the series theme and idea is unique. I like the survival theme and how interesting the series gets while unfolding. I hope we get to see a season 2!

zvgor,The worst 2nd season ever.,1/10,30 December 2022,"The 1st season was interesting with some good ideas. The second season is just unwatchable. Terrible acting, unnecessary moral messages with long and meaningless monologues.Almost all decisions from the characters are forced without a motive. The protagonist is simply dumb. You just want to punch him. Every character teaches a life lesson to another. Ugh.At some point some of the important characters die, but then they actually don't die and reappear and then eventually die??! Even though they lost like gallons of blood hours ago. There is no logic.I'm really struggling to understand any rate above 3.It's just bad. Really, really, really bad."
malnizzle,Absolutely brilliant!,10/10,16 January 2023,"This series is absolutely amazing! It has got everything! It has got really good actors, awesome plotwists, humor, many beautiful visuals, thrilling challenges, a lot of obstacles, mindgames, and It will keep you captivated and glued to your seat.In my opinion this is way better than squidgame!I would highly recommend anyone to watch this!The adaption from manga to screen is brilliant and all the actors chosen are perfect for the characters!The ratings on this series deserves so much better! It's such an awesome series!I promise you that both seasons will not disappoint!It is definitely worth your time! Go watch it💜"
kamranmahmood87,Watch Squid Game instead,1/10,2 November 2021,"This is a poor man's version of Squid Game. Horrible writing, horrible acting, full of plot holes and inconsistencies. It is decent in the first couple of episodes and then goes downhill from here. At moments it is obvious the writers are just trying to drag it out.

sneakaninjaz,Meh,6/10,1 January 2023,"This one was kind of all over the place. Seems like they wanted to cram as much as possible in these 8 episodes. They had unlimited bullets and unlimited people to use them on. Lol seems so empty until it's time for one guy to go on a killing spree. Then it's tons of people to get rid of for the camera.I enjoyed the first season a lot more. You grow to like the characters. In this one you already like them so nothing new.I did like the school girl though. Bikini top is still awesome as usual.All in all, nothing special. If you have nothing to do then why not? But you aren't missing anything if you don't watch. Happy New Year!

Ramin-Nekouei,A Manga Crossover that Shattered Borders,9/10,16 January 2022,"How far will people go to stay alive? What burdens are they willing to heap upon body, mind, and soul to cling to this fragile existence? At what point does the cost build to a point where one will no longer be willing to pay the price a situation demands. What then? Will they resign themselves to the cruel hands of fate? Or will the human spirit prove itself powerful enough to not only find a way out, but forge one if need be. Considering both its respective books and series, Alice in Borderland is the rise of a new era of death games capable of capturing both apocalyptic and survival horror. The series owns a high profile in the actual design, plot, execution of the games, choice of music, filming, and developing intriguing characters.

Malcolm278,"Thrilling, Enthralling and Worth the Binge",9/10,25 October 2021,"I've been on a drama binge following Squid Game and after watching both that and Sweet Home Alice in Borderlands was good follow-up! The story and setup are simple, high IQ Shut-in and his buddies get trapped in a copy of Tokyo where they play games to survive, nothing new but exciting none the less.Story: The plots nothing crazy. The first episode does well in setting up both the main group and the games. Something to note was chemistry of the main 3 boys. It's great, it's so real, you'll get attached to them and their persona very quickly as their dynamic is pretty relatable. The games, start strong. This show isn't crazy gory but the first death is chilling and gets you amped to see how the games progress. The games overall are pretty fun to watch as they're all puzzles that you'll definitely say ""huh, how"" as our MC blows through them.Characters: They're great! The choice in actors and their performances were very well done. The sad and depressing scenes had me SAD and the intense moments at the edge of my seat. You could tell the actors were in tune with their characters and it made the show all the better.Overall: Alice in Borderlands is a great show with a simple premise, fun and interesting games, great acting and engaging cast. When season 2 drops, i'm going to be right on it!"
bryanlheckman,"S1 great, S2 pretty good except final episode",7/10,5 January 2023,"Really fun series! It kind is of a squid game crossed with anime characters in real life. Really fun action sequences every single episode. Took me a while to hold the characters in my brain straight but after a bit it really sucks you in. At times it feels like there is some nuances lost in translation, but not Enid or the story to suffer. Plot line jumps the shark a few times with Wild inferences , but holds together well enough to keep me interested. There wasn't any time I felt like I wanted to stop watching until the S2 final episode, jeez what a dragged out, boring bunch of drivel! A solid 50 minutes should've been cut from it.

js-69219,Really good thriller,8/10,5 January 2021,"This is based on a manga and it shows, so if those sensibilities aren't for you, you might want to skip it. Otherwise, the plot is captivating, the characters are interesting, and the twists and turns make for really great entertainment. I was genuinely surprised almost every episode. I'm so used to thrillers and anime/manga that I would get frustrated by how obvious the next plot point was and found the pacing exhausting because it was so predictable--except I was dead wrong every single time. I eventually had to accept this was a unique series and I couldn't guess what would happen next. It felt very fresh and exciting.I started the manga after finishing season 1 and was surprised to realize I think the show is better in many ways. The things I didn't like about the show, such as awkward pacing, can be attributed to the manga's flow and other predictable difficulties when adapting 2-D to 3-D. However, the show also brings a lot of the manga to life. The soundtrack, fight scenes, death scenes, and very solid acting really put this series over the top.Can't wait for Season 2!"
perlamos,Splendid series,10/10,2 January 2023,"This is certainly one of the best series I have ever seen. Based on a manga, this series provides a fantastic story, with some of the best story concepts I have ever read or seen. Cinematography was also excellent, if you like picturesque and theatrical settings this series is definetely a choice. I am in awe of the main concept of the story, the characters and all the questions that were brought during as the story unfolded.I really feel that this is an underrated show in terms of popularity, it is peculiar, exciting and very emotional.Do yourself a favour and watch it, both seasons are really worth the time!

conniesimpson-16266,I honestly don't know how this has so many bad reviews,9/10,1 April 2021,"I honestly watched this and it was instantly my kind of thing. Play the game or die, win the game or die.The concept of the cards representing the difficulty of each game was actually a nice touch too. The cliche 1 second before the game kills you actually put me on the edge of my seat so many times and it made me want to watch more. I don't really watch series because they drag on but this definitely got me hooked.I really recommend this. If you like twisted reality, parallel universe, play sadistic games or you die then this is your kind of series.

mariskaatj-23098,"Season 1 nice, season 2 wth",5/10,28 December 2022,"Saw season 1 before the squid game-mania and watched AiB twice before season 2 came out, but no season 2 was a dissapointment. It got too mainstream and the last episode is a nice one to fold your laundry with.Season 1 was very nice, good games and some mind blowing and plot twisting scenes. I would recommend to watch season 1. I'm normally not into Asian series but this one really blew my mind. Also the 'players' are very good and i liked the development of the characters.In season 2 some characters came alive again and also the games are not so good as in 1. Some holes in some games. Unfortunately Alice in Borderland became too mainstream.

merischanghi,Not as good as I expected,7/10,17 December 2020,"Before it was released, I had been looking forward. However, after I finished 4 Eps, I didn't think it fulfilled my expectation.
Some people's deaths are unnecessarily. The game in Ep 3 is a little boring. It is not interesting, without unexpected turns. It seems that this game is only aimed to kill his two friends and provide him a chance to meet the heroine. However, I don't know why the heroine can survive so long either, as it proves that she is just lucky enough after I finished Ep 4.
But it is still worth watching if you are a fan of thrilling and suspenseful dramas."
seooh,Masterpiece,10/10,24 January 2021,"This is probably the best show Netflix has ever released.
The story-line is brilliant, the cast is amazing, special effects and OST are epic, and the acting is just insane.
This is one of those rare cases where the live action is way better than the manga... I binged the series about a month ago, and cannot seem to move on to my normal life. The obsession is real. Worth to watch and worth the hype for the upcoming season.Ps. Dori Sakurada and Tao Tsuchiya nailed their roles.

matoulakara,Unexpectedly amazing!,9/10,19 December 2020,"A very nice series that keeps you alert almost all the time. There were two episodes a bit ""lower"" compared to the others. The only reason that I rated it with 9 and not 10 is that it still does not explain two important questions. How did all these people were ""transfered"" to that world and how this technology of lasers and so on was found and by whom. Hoping these questions will be answered in Season 2. If yes, then my review will be changed to 10!

yasminbridges-43701,My new favourite series!,10/10,2 February 2021,"This series is excellent. The storyline is unique and so well executed, the pacing is great and keeps you 100% interested at all times, and the characters are fantastic. The cinematography is so good and makes it even more enjoyable.The only thing that makes me dislike this series is the fact that I can never watch it for the first time again now! If you are a fan of the manga, then this show is one of very few live actions that absolutely does it's manga justice. If you have never read the manga or have any interest in doing so, then that doesn't matter at all. This series is very enjoyable whether you are a fan of manga or anime or not - and as long as you don't mind subtitles, I think any dystopian thriller/adventure lover will want to watch this one.

berglundjulia,Love it,10/10,1 October 2021,I absolutely love this series and can't wait until season two. Haven't read the manga. Can't wait to find out more of what happened to get rid of basically all the people and why some are left but they have different timelines. And where do the lasers come from? And is everyone who disappeared gone or are they still somewhere? Aaand when will they find the dressed cards?
earlwan,SO INTENSE!!!,10/10,15 December 2020,"I'm usually a bit skeptical with live action adaptation from mangas, but Alice in Borderland surpassed my expectations. I haven't read the manga, so I'm sure how faithful it is to the source material, but as it is on its own, it was brilliant! Sets the tone pretty much straight away, had me on the edge of my seat all the way. Really enjoyed the characters, thought the cast were great! Some really awesome action sequence, good twists and wtf moments. All I'll say it's like Battle Royale x Hunger Games x 28 Days Later. Don't wanna spoil it for you!
Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did! Peace!

allenyiny,Not for everyone but fun nevertheless for me,9/10,2 January 2023,"Good characters, story, plot. That's all there is to say. It's a nice show with really good action and dialogue that makes sense (The dub is terrible don't watch it). It's on par with squid game but I would say this is slightly better for taking more risks and having a banger 2nd season on par with the first.Downsides:
Season 1 peaked at the beginning (1-3) when it was in an abandoned Tokyo. But when we get to the beach it slows down entirely. Season two is the same level of quality through out.Upsides:
The games are creative and none are bad. Season two has amazing chemistry with the characters. ""Solitary confinement"" was so good. It's funny when it needs to be and doesn't overload it. Story is very good.

burgerdale,definitely not my cup of tea,3/10,24 September 2021,"I still have no clue where's the hype coming from. Characters development is soooo bad and I dont even feel emotionally connected with any of the characters. The show gets really cringey after the third episode. I forced myself to watch it till the last episode because I was hoping everything would finally make sense at the end but nope.

jibletj63,Loved it,8/10,16 December 2020,"Really hope there is a season 2!I love being transported to a different world and Alice is a convincing one too. The acting is great and the camera work is great too. The story is silly but it's also awesome too! If you roll with it, it's a enjoyable ride! The dialogue can be a bit over the top but that's part of manga.
You won't be disappointed with investing your time in this

robd-50235,"Great storyline, characters, actors, and visual",10/10,20 July 2023,"Fantastic series. Great concept with great storyline. The back stories of several characters gives the story depth and makes each character interesting even the ones with flaws. Loved the game play of events, especially the logic ones, and the diversity of characters was great. Each suit of card has meaning and each number of card has meaning. There were surprises including some characters who did not last long but you expected them to do so and other that lasted for a long time when you expected the opposite.Hoping another series arises even though they could leave it where it is. Highly recommended."
kwxk-71741,Tasteless,5/10,23 March 2023,"Don't know any better word that'd fit the series.By the end, I felt confused and frustrated that it took 16 whole hours.The only truly interesting episode is the last one. The previous 15 episodes feel dragging, endless, and boring.The story is full of plot holes, plot armor, and just simply weird moments that make no sense.The main guy, Arisu, shows no character development whatsoever - instead of deciding his OWN path it felt like everything happened TO him and he just went with it.Some characters are so ridiculously plot armored that it reminded me of some Bollywood movies.Finally, the ending is interesting but it renders the previous 15 episodes basically pointless.So yeah...better watch some other movie, it'd tell the same story but much shorter and clearer. Or watch Christopher Nolan. He's good."
valugi,yet another Battle Royale,3/10,4 March 2023,"But Battle Royale did come in another context and a life time ago and it meant something. This is fake and stereotypical to the max. I can watch only on fast forward. Everyone has a backstory, some tear jerky some plain stupid. In movie demographics are pretty much the audience demographics. Logic and detective work are close to null, accent is put on gorish and semi violent interactions. Some characters appear semi inteligent. There is a feel of manga and/or game to it - no real depth - just another level and 5 more characters.I am waching it basically to see with what they come in terms of games - though most games are not clearly defined.

As long as season 2 super good and they give us a gooood ending -> it has to be one of the best series ever. please, please season 2!!!

aliashfaque-03773,Awesome,8/10,2 January 2023,"Binge watched season 2.Based on manga graphic novel, This survival thriller drama has returned with decent season 2 after 2 years.S2 picks up where S1 left off.Arisu and the gang continue to survive in a dystopian world consisting of death games and betrayal, and advances to next level of game.I really enjoyed this season more.It has Cleverly created thrilling games, good character development, quick transitions into flashback / back stories of character and present situation, Good pacing except for last episode, Easy cliffhangers, convenient plot development, Good choreographed action n combat scenes (specially in epi 7), Decent performances, Good editing, VFX n visuals.But it took too much time to reach the Climax.I'm happy with the ending.They kept one window open for next season.Over all, I enjoyed it.Total binge-worthy."
sahincem48,Season 2 is just unbearably bad!,5/10,29 December 2022,"They gained a lot of traction with season 1 and I have been waiting for the new season for that reason. Story and acting is below mediocre through the whole season 2. I have no words about main characters' bad performance. I was told squid game was a copy of this but I can easily say SG's writing and acting is ahead of this. After showing the joker card at the end I hope they didn't mean to shoot season 3 as the same crew and story line of ""all happened during heart failures"" cannot help them sustain the excitement and same traction. All i can say is thanks for the season 1 and hope not to see a season 3."
chrispedley-34371,Surprisingly entertaining,8/10,16 November 2021,"I watched this after getting caught up in the Squid game hype, it came up as a suggestion on Netflix and it was far superior to its Korean counterpart in my opinion. Fast paced, gory,intriguing storyline etc. Highly recommend.

cthulufunk,Very amped!,8/10,18 May 2021,"Super kinetic series that loses it's way towards the end but brings you back in with a nice finale leaving you wanting season 2 now! If you love manga & Japanese action thrillers like Battle Royale & Tokyo Gore Police, you'll like AIB. I've not read the AIB manga but this makes me want to.It's like Cube meets The Running Man. Highly recommend.

zoldlady,It makes you forget all the flaws in the plot,9/10,6 January 2021,"I see quite a few people give a bad review because of the nonsensical plot particular towards the end at the beach. I also see it right now. But when I watched the show it was all fascinating and I just ignored all those flaws. This is no doubt a super attractive show that caught yours eyes. I guess all shows have their flaws especially those describing something unreal. Such shows are intrinsically nonsensical. It is for this reason I'd give it a 9 out of 10 even though it has all those flaws. I have to say the review system has flaws in itself.

shirevg,more shallow than squid games even though they tried hard,8/10,24 December 2022,"Games are obviously crazy and over-the-top, wish they showed more diamond games (intellectual, so a lot of suspence). Half-open ending is perfect for either finale or renewal, 'inception'-style. Instead of typical korean economy stuff from squid games, there's a lot of morality discussions driven through flashbacks of characters. Unlike squid games, players have no motive to kill each other, except in-game and everybody are scattered around the city, so there is almost no confrontation. And there are practically no villains among main and recurring characters, i liked it a lot. Still, characters in squid games seemed more interesting. Maybe because they have a lot of screen time in the outside world. In the end squid games in my opinion is better but if you're a fan you definitely should watch AIB too.

corabsentia,Keeps you interested,9/10,5 October 2021,"Maybe it's just me that I find manga and any related series/movies exciting due to the language (any asiatic language) which I find interesting to listen (coming from a Balkan- Mediterranean background I'm a little bit jealous of their accents), but this series was actually on point. Liked the story behind it (parallel universe) and the way the characters expanded throughout the episodes. Kinda was sad in the middle (won't spoil tho) but it's a definitely a hit for anyone that likes fantasy/splatter/agony content. It's an 9 cause I'lol wait for the next season to have a complete opinion.

aljaz-bozicko,Isekai,5/10,18 October 2021,"Protagonist that is A gamer, with smart quirks but looks generic, transported into another world-time where he cant cope with reality until it takes it as a game and starts collecting rewards while people with other skills are killed, except that one love-interest. Someone who knows electronics? Nah. Corporate cutthroat? Nah. Street-smart guy? Nah. A climber? Sounds useful. The first one to die? A schoolgirl, because they are dum and you want gamer teenagers that are smart. I mean, I love isekai stories, this one is just not a good one, it is meh. Protagonist's superpower is also crying and delaying hard choices because they are hard till too late, which is not particularly attractive.Also, story is just plain. In first challenge every time they have to solve something, they will to it last second. I mean, I get it if you do it once, but always? Some parts are low tech (fried chips) but you get ultragear that looks quite breakable for just a few games? And even most simple of challenges are designed so most people, like 99% will probably fail them, so I dont quite get it ... if you win higher lvl challenges, you are ... because protagonist is just generic. He is not ultrasmart, ultrastrong, ultraskilled or ultrakind (when he gets to kill his friends, he does it, he comes around only after story-shield activates). And that cutthroat ... why? I mean, why did that boy attack her? Why did she chose to target him if he is the weakest of them all, I mean, I get it, he is the weakest of them all, but it would be in her interest to use him to get closer to the group, but instead she acts spoiled. And the most obvious flaw ... the most logical organisation for any group would be to divide labor according to skill, no one is master of everything so strongest of groups would have a strong leader, fighter, smart guy, caretaker etc., they would be well organised to tackle any challenge. But this game has a hearts challenge that is 1/4 of all challenges, meaning such groups will be the first to get wiped out. But no one is skilled in everything so you will get killed anyway more you play those games? More you play, less likely you are to survive. I mean, imagine someone is capable of that but is just too kind to let other people die on their own. So if you win, you are ... what does that tell about you. It is like game is tailored against everything, but in particular against a society and if you are to survive it, I honestly dont want you to survive it.So ... isekai with a meh story for people that dont enjoy anime. What did I learn from it? If you are indecisive and generic enough, people might take pity on you, so why not try that? Poor you. I mean, everyone else will die as a result, because kindness gets you killed, but good for you."
jimmybounder,Excellent show with a solid storyline!,10/10,31 January 2023,"I've recently started watching foreign shows/movies. This is up there for one of my favourites so far! All I can suggest is watch it with the original audio not the dubbed version as it ruins it in my opinion.The characters are great, some of them are very likeable and some of them drive me crazy as I hate them but in a good way.I get very invested into the story and what happens throughout. The way Arisu develops through the series is great to see, I hope everyone else enjoys it as much as me. Japanese shows are filmed with such an artistic style so different to the Western entertainment industry, it's a great change of pace and ideas within filming.I look forward to finishing the next season and seeing what happens.

matinway-72120,An Interesting but Flawed Series,6/10,3 March 2023,"Alice in Borderland has an interesting premise and setup that drew me in, and there were definitely moments of excitement and suspense that kept me engaged. However, the show had too many inconsistencies, illogical events, and logic errors that made it feel less polished and thought-out. While I found the show watchable, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to those looking for a highly-crafted story. The effects and visuals felt low-budget and could have been improved, which may be a drawback for some viewers.Overall, Alice in Borderland was an okay show with some enjoyable elements, but it had its flaws.

Yes you!I really felt the need to submit my review, because you can tell the creators put a lot of love in the series and they deserve all the prais (sorry for the bad English).The series has a little but of a slow start because of the character building, but than imidiatly captures you in a twist you probably would not expect. From than on you will be on the edge of your seat. After that, you are hooked. Cant say anything more than that.All of the characters are interresting. The acting is A+ and the concept(s) are cool and as fresh as can be expected.Have fun watching!

The premise in itself is very interesting and majority of the games are sufficiently interesting enough to keep you hookedSets expectations for characters to not have any plot armour (this is NOT the case in Season 2 where it is painfully obvious that the major characters have huge amounts of plot armour)Except for a very scenes most of the episodes don't have any kind of filler scenesThe story is riveting and is interesting enough to make you want to watch it continuouslyThe finished s2 in a such a way that irrespective of whether the show ends in s2 or goes on for another season (even though the manga has ended) because netflix wants to greenlight it, it makes for a clean transition. I personally am neutral about the show stopping/going for another seasonBad things about the show
As mentioned in the pros, the season 2 plot armour gets ridiculous after a pointThere are some very hard to believe scenes especially in season 2 where certain characters magically get out of difficult situationsSome cheesy action sequences (eg a character punching a tiger) but I'll admit that this isn't that badSome of the dialogue/character reasoning skills could have been fleshed out a bit more properly, I don't know if this is a translation error as I watched the show with english subtitles but it seemed bad in certain places."
sonavitkova-29985,Better then Squid Game,10/10,12 December 2022,"I like the actors in this series. Their names are Kento Yamazaki as Arisu, Keita Machida as Karube, Yuki Morinaga as Shota and Asahina Aya as Kuina. My favourite character is Kuina because she can do martial arts and she can also run fast. She was revaled as transgender in some episode. This series is really good it got really open ending so season 2 can look really good and it can surprise us as watchers of this series. I think that some death was unnecessary because some of them was really good characters in this series. I am very exited for season 2 which is coming in december 22th 2022 and u should watch it!

smeesheady,A boring copy of Jacob's ladder movie.,2/10,11 February 2023,"This has to be the most obvious stealing of concepts . At least they should have put a taglines as based on Jacob's ladder. The whole 2 seasons could have put in to a 180 minutes movie. One of the weakest and predictable ending ever.There is no need of Season 3 at all. It's time to end it .although there a some good moments , the fight scenes are quite similar to a cheap Bollywood movie . Also like others mentioned , the poor editing make show , so boring .So unless if you have nothing to do , or just to kill the time , I am not recommended to watch it.It could have been short and better.

Happy, sadness, anger, anxious and it will even cause adrenaline spikes. I certainly recommend this series to both friends and family. You can either watch it with English dubbed voice overs or its original Japanese language with English subtitles. Definitely try it out! Great story and great character development.

evelinasisb,Dope!,10/10,25 January 2021,"When I heard that Netflix is going to turn a Japanese manga into a TV Series, I was pretty sure that it wouldn't work, because Netflix did this in the past (Death Note) and the result was awful. But this time, they left the Japanese to do the whole work and it totally worked out!In my opinion, Alice in Borderland is one of the best Series on Netflix. You want to see something that is going to freak you out and make you stuck with this show? Then Alice in Borderland is the best solution. The special effects are awesome and you can see the development of each character through the games that they play. Also the story line is really interesting!!! Love It!!!!

carolinalopezzzz,"A good way to pass time, but not worth the hype",6/10,28 December 2020,"The first two episodes are kind of worth it. After that, it just feels lackluster, not so entertaining, and attention-grabbing. The backstories of the characters are not always that necessary and sometimes even cut scenes that are of interest, looks like a collage. As it progresses it loses more and more, it becomes a violent battle between the rational and the irrational, totally expectable. The conclusions at which the main character reaches are also not so perceptive and well explained as in the beginning, it becomes more about humans than about the game. That's why in my opinion, is not some groundbreaking work. Mainly because it can be compared with so many other great works with a similar dystopian story that are so much better.

rodriguebf,Epic and awesome concepts until last episode,7/10,15 December 2020,"no spoil - I just finished the serie and it was awesome except for the last episode, i was hooked from episode 1 and I recommend this serie to anyone.Until the last episode... Everything was great, the plot was great, the actors were great but everything just went the japanese anime way : way too much useless & dramatic scenes lasting for hours without purpose and making me feel more than annoyed.
I was just feeling like ""come on! just get on with it""
I was so disappointed the serie had to finish this way because the 7 first episode were just amazing. Hope for a season 2!

Sloth-63,"Great concept, terrible execution",1/10,28 February 2023,"This turned out as a recommended watch after having seen Squid game.Now I haven't watched or read the Anime/Manga, but I can immediately tell from the over exaggerated reactions and hyper emotional responses the characters portrait that it is one.The plot got me hooked, but that's about it! Everything else in the show is bad. Horrible acting, horrible stunts, dumb characters, and a boring villain...I'm not sure why the high rating is for this one, but if you want to watch the actors have their mouth open the entire time, make some dumb decisions while making it out to be the smartest thing they can think of, and scream/yell every spoken word with random flashbacks that make no sense in the middle, please be my guest and watch this one.

I wasn't to happy with episode 8 of season 2 ( last episode). I felt like they were trying to hard to make it extra psychological which I thought ruined the last episode for me. Some of the things just didn't make sense honestly. I ALSO HAVE 2 questions. WHY NOT just break his thumb, and WHY NOT just stab his hand. Also what's the purpose of everybody returns even the dead, with slight memories. Other than that I feel like it was very enjoyable, best way to watch is in Japanese, almost feels like a live action anime. Acting was extremely good.!!"

jptoivonen,"Good one, but not exactly Squid Game",7/10,25 November 2021,"I liked the atmosphere of Alice in Borderland very much. They have built a sort of dystopian feeling in the series that carried through all episodes. There was energy in the beginning and the plot was getting thicker towards the end. In between the series lost it a bit, and some twists in the plot and solutions to tasks came somewhat out of the blue. A nice series though, yet not as good as Squid Game about the same theme in my opinion.

blueginkoh,Intense,7/10,14 January 2021,"I haven't read the manga, so I can't really comment on its accuracy to the source material (although I'm of the opinion that even major changes are fine as long if they serve the director's vision)
This director really knows what he's doing. The show is a worthwhile watch for anyone who enjoys suspenseful thrillers with a heap of action thrown in for a pretty penultimate climax.
The twists are set up and executed well, and the motivations and backstories of the characters give even the most despicable characters a layer of depth the viewer can empathize with. Sato utilizes information about the characters and story masterfully, doling it out just enough so the viewer understands what's going on, while withholding the rest to make for an engaging viewing experience.
The cinematography is absolutely excellent. Framing, composition, blocking, lighting: all of it is utilized incredibly well to create some absolutely stunning filmmaking.
I will say that it can be a bit of a tough series to get into upon first viewing. The first episode meanders a bit, and the acting can get pretty overkill. The first time I tried to watch this I ended up just putting it down halfway through the first episode because the acting was just a bit too overbearing for my taste. However, once the actual story begins and the characters are thrust into the games, the show drastically improves on the pacing.
Additionally, someone unfamiliar with the nature of manga/anime might have a hard time suspending their disbelief enough to watch through all 8 episodes. The characters all end up screaming each other's names at one point at the top of their lungs in some dramatic fashion (which got kind of cringe for me sometimes), and the last three episodes are extremely shounen in nature, with absolute balls-to-the-walls action and what seems like 5 different shadowy organizations plotting against one another, each more powerful than the last.
However, this series definitely has a lot of heart, and there are some incredibly emotionally intense episodes (Ep 7 is a standout for me), coupled with some very well choreographed action, and well directed suspense. This series is certainly an emotional rollercoaster, with me equally cheering for the characters and sobbing my eyes out more times than I can count. It is definitely worth a day spent just bingeing the whole thing."
ericaortaleza,Good puzzles but confusing,7/10,22 May 2022,"Some of the puzzles in this show are better than Squid game but I a also just as confused as the next person. So is everything a simulation? I enjoyed the first five episodes but then the show drops.

kostaschrisma,Don't waste your time,2/10,13 January 2023,"Alice in Borderland was a complete letdown. I had heard good things about the show and was excited to watch it, but it ended up being one of the most tedious and unengaging shows I've ever seen. The story was slow-moving and uninteresting, and the characters were flat and uninteresting. The supposed message of not wasting your life felt incredibly ironic considering how much time I felt I wasted watching this show.The pacing was painfully slow and dragged on for what felt like forever. I found myself constantly checking the time, hoping that it would be over soon. The plot was predictable and unoriginal, and the characters failed to connect with me in any way. I found myself not caring about their fate and struggles.The acting was mediocre and failed to bring any depth or emotion to the characters. Overall, Alice in Borderland was a major disappointment and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Save yourself the time and find something else to watch. To add to that, the irony of the show's main message of not wasting your life while the show itself felt like a waste of time is not lost on me and makes it even more disappointing."
elinaducommun,My opinion,10/10,9 March 2021,"My favourite series is Alice in borderland because I think that this is the best series.
I love this series because there action, dangerous and even deadly games with sometimes only one survivor.
I like the actors, I find that they play their roles very well.
For my part my favorite actor is Nijiro Murakami in the role of chishiya.
This series is thrilling whit a lot of adrenaline.
If I had to rate Alice in borderland, this one would be 10/10.
For those who love action and who are not afraid of blood, I strongly recommend this series.

jda_rappa,fun but so stupid (s1),5/10,26 February 2023,"The first episode had be excited but the rest of the show divulges into a collection of weird nonsensical plot lines, stupid plot twists, bad writing and cringey characterizations.Maybe its better as a manga or anime but in live action the whole show just feels juevenile and shallow to a crazy degree. The games are fun for the most part but after the introduction of ""beach"" everything just falls apart in terms of tone, sense, etc.Unfortunately at best it feels like a trope-y manga story. Much of the second half of season 1 ends up feeling like it was written by a 15 year old who was inspired by other YA novels to right his or her own.Had a ton of potential but unfortunately i think it failed to capitalize. I'll check out s2 but my expectations and hope for it are a lot lower now.

SparkleLily209,It just begins with shock value.,6/10,11 December 2021,"I was really compelled to watch this show, but they killed off some major protagonist Arisu's friends early in the show just for shock value. If they killed them off later I would of felt less upset, its like the author could have used them to make the story more compelling and build on them, but he just threw it away. I was turned off by it."

nabeghe,The best in the genre of Game of Death,10/10,21 April 2023,"It's very unfair that this TV show has a lower rating than other shows that, if they were properly and fairly evaluated, would have no value! Of course, f course, the people who give ratings to TV shows are not always from a specific spectrum, and not all people participate in rating, nor has everyone watched the show!This TV show is the best in the genre of ""Game of Death,"" and it provides us with an unimaginable ending at the end of the second season! So I don't know why it should receive a lower score?! Details can be overlooked, but people always get obsessive about shows like this, where there is no propaganda behind them.

valkithomas,Season 2 episode 7 worst ever,8/10,3 January 2023,"When I first saw the first season I was really impressed by the different plot and story line. So in my opinion i had scored the season with 8/10. But now in season 2 , after I saw the 7 ep .. ughh.. i began to feel Bad for giving such a big note. The worst thing is that Usagi gets stabbed for 2-3 times in her right leg and after the fight she appears with her left leg tied up .. so dissapointing. And all the fighting was Like a Dragonball z fight , or like Jackie Chan vs terminator ..
But the other episodes and serial overall is ok , hope that you will not incline the balance too much for this episode like i Did too."
kiddninalyfe,VERY INTERESTING,8/10,18 December 2020,"MADE IT THROUGH 3 EPISODES SO FAR AND ITS STARTING TO PICK BUT MAN I FEEL SO SORRY FOR OUR MAIN CHARACTER AND I STILL HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS I HOPE TO BE ANSWERED LIKE WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS AND WHERE IS EVERYBODY ELSE

lemoinal,Please do a US version,4/10,5 January 2023,"This show has so much good ideas, but it's really painful to watch. It alternates from a good and original action show, to a phase of 'character development ' that could be written by a 5 years old. All characters are awfully one sided, to a point that they would make Superman looks like a model of complexity. Basically good guys overcome obstacle thanks to the power of friendship. Thanks, i loved to watch saint Seiya and captain tsubasa as a kid, but i need a bit more now. I hope they will make a us version of it. Hollywood might have their default, but since the 80s characters have a bit more depth.

mennojansen-91318,Games or Lore?,7/10,9 June 2022,"While watching the first part of the season, I longed for watching more of the games and the lore bits killed the speed, the second part the lore comes out really well in my opinion. Don't take this series to seriously, as the realistic properties lack a little."
marikot-57320,"Alice in Borderland is a brief, entertaining, and pretty typical death game",10/10,21 December 2022,"I LOVE THIS SHOW, I LOVE THIS SHOW, I LOOOOOOOVE THIS SHOW.I am a huuuuuuge fan of survival shows/shows wherein you have to survive/do a bunch of mindbending/psychological puzzles to survive and THIS SHOW DELIVERED.I mean if you love Battle Royale then you will love this! I was not sure about this, but I am so glad I started watching it, it is amazing!!! I got hooked from the start and I was excited for each episode. The characters are so good, storyline is brilliant, and I enjoyed every episode. I have many questions but am sure we will get our answers in the next season. Cannot wait for S2! I will definitely rewatch it again :D.

qctfhkfyh,So much potential...,5/10,26 December 2022,"But, there are pretty good characters, an interesting idea. I am not talking about how well it was executed, good enough to watch and enjoy. The most annoying character is Arisu. The guy is that so ashamed to look at women, he is a weak and idiotic character that somehow is always on top. His dramatic crying and always trying to be a hero in situation where he just gotta fight for his life and kill someone who doesn't deserve to be in the world, but he always finds an excuse not to do it, is just annoying as hell. He is an emotional baby that can't accept the new way of living. Every time he cries or do his stupid face reaction like he is struggling, damn it's disgusting. Almost every other character have some reason to fight either on a good or evil side, but Arisu he's just pointless, clueless and totally dumb character. Too many repeatable situations and reactions, it doesn't feel that the character grows, he remains the same person regardless of all consequences and experiences he gets. This is totally out of concept of a role playing games that this tv show tries to represent. I would love to see his character to get mature and less emotional, especially of what he got through."

joedelaney-45953,I like the series,7/10,30 December 2022,", kind of like a twist of the squid games but with more story. Season 2 Has everyone running around the city against a lone gunman. Everyone's lives are in danger yet no one seems to care about having weapons to protect themselves except 1 guy???.... U would think the first thing people would do is to find weapons to protect themselves especially after what everyone has been through ....realistic human reactions are important in maintaining the intensity of the show. I'm surprised there were no love affairs developed by the players at the beach. Everything seems to be platonic. It's an interesting thriller concept to put us on the edge of the seat. I love Japanese people, I believe they are an amazing nationality that I deeply respect. Great job! Thank You for the entertainment!!!!!!!"
shafayamir,I won't spoil,10/10,16 January 2023,"This series deserves more than 7 rating in IMDb, Because apparently this a absolute masterpiece. I literally binged watch the season 2 now you can judge how amazing it's made for us. The series has a unique premise and an intense, action-packed story that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. The characters are well-developed and relatable, and the world-building is intriguing and imaginative. The art style is also noteworthy, with detailed and expressive illustrations that bring the story to life. Overall, ""Alice in Borderland"" is a thrilling and highly enjoyable series that is definitely worth checking out for fans of action, science fiction and fantasy manga.

pandagq,What the H,3/10,21 June 2023,"I don't know how this show is getting great reviews. The set up they are in makes no sense. Are they in a VR set up? No because objects that were hidden from before the games started are where they left. So in a matter of a few seconds an entire city's population disappears? Ok. Let's say that's possible. The city disappears and reappears on different days because the players show up on different days. That's impossible! And then there is the ridiculous acting. Episode 3 spends half the show with the main characters crying about dying and reliving flashbacks. One of the flashbacks was the three of them on a tandem bike. That is the level of corniness of this show. Max corny. I stopped after episode 4. The main survivor is laying around crying. I just can't do it anymore. When it gets to the point where you wish the main characters would just ship up and die because they are super annoying, it's time to stop."

louismsalas,Poor plot devices and writing make season 2 unwatchable,1/10,23 March 2023,"This premise has such potential, but it becomes unwatchably bad. Another show where characters are written to make unreasonable choices to further the story and cause unnecessary carnage and drama. While carnage and drama are certainly a staple for this genre, this goes completely over the top. A show where characters make nearly every bad decision possible, especially after all they've been through, is terrible character development, makes me not care about any of the characters and completely takes me out of the show. Season 1 ends at a solid 6/10. Season two ends at a 1/10. Not a chance I'll watch Season 3. Ends up being one of the biggest dissapointments of a show I've ever had the misfortune to experience.

marvinheth,An Actually Good Anime rework,9/10,24 December 2020,"The series which is redone from the Same named Anime shows that Animes can be redone as a none animated Series. After Death Note was such a bad remake, Alice in boarderland surpasses all expectations that an Anime Fan could have. The Story itsself goes beyond the Anime and doesnt Leave the viewer behind. It hab's high chances of giving you a Short Night with their really interesting content which is Build by a Game every episode while the mainstory keeps on going, so that there is no Filler.
The whole Series was an unexpected Highlight during corona and leaves the viewer with just searching when the 2nd season is about to Start.
For me a 9/10!"

mennoiloiklong,Precious japanese series,10/10,28 February 2021,"This series is truly a hidden gem. I am pretty sure that once you start watching, you just don't want to stop. Only one episode in but hooked. It is based on manga which is a retelling of ""Alice in Wonderland"" story and it is an ACTION-ADVENTURE-MYSTERY-TRAGEDY-THRILLER about chosen groups of people had moved to the game world, and they forced to conquer all the games that's about death and life. On the same page, they need to participate and conquer the games in order to survive in limited factors such as time, cards, etc. For the beginning, the show starts interesting and it made me not think about thriller. Anyway, after a few minites it reminded me it was still thriller lol. Furthermore, I was ridiculous and curious a bit when they moved to the alternate world that had the stuff same as the actual world but there're only chosen people had lived in this world, so they can stay in luxurious places with Michelin food without paying. By the way, I really have to say that the storytelling, characterization, hooked point, and so on are all fascinating. Moreover, it can surprise me every episodes. Even though, sometimes I feel unbelievable with the characters' decisions and games' rules. But I love it when I tried to solve the problems with Arisu. It's literally fun!!! Like as the puzzle. Furthermore, the actors and actresses are great and they acted their character very clear and interesting. Plot is not complicated much but I really got hooked up with the scenes that Arisu and his friends joined the game, and I can't be waiting for watching what will be happened next. However, I recommend this series because I confirm it will give you a unique experience that you have never feel it with the others before."
fannylevie-92448,Really good cast,10/10,16 May 2023,"I just loved that series, I think it was profound and very well acted. Of course it's a bit more emotional because it's a Japanese series. Tsuchiya and Kento works like a charms as a couple on the screen. Also Nijiro Murakami rules with his condescend but friendly acting. Sho Aoyagi is very present specially in season 2, when we know he is not the bad guy anymore + all the others actors, it was stupendous :) I will give it 9.5/10 but on a scale from 0 to 100. I will give it a 100 :) Don't give me a 0 or beware of H2SO4 :) Ok I'm missing 75 characters so I will talk more about the values I love in this series: protecting, caring, struggling and winning against yourself, fighting, and keep going against adversity.. Just the cast was really great.

sgtjcj,Stupidest ending ever,6/10,17 July 2023,"This was a very entertaining series. However, the ending absolutely sucked. The writers need help. They obviously don't know the audience.Characters: pretty well thought out.The acting was pretty good as well.The voice overs seemed to fit the characters and the actors.The story line throughout was mediocre. But it's a fantasy type movie, so one can't expect it to play out as real.A few things were over the top and not realistic in any way. Some characters somehow made it to the end without any explanation. A little more in depth writing would have helped this.But, all in all, I think it's worth watching."
TrickyEm,Very promising first season,8/10,18 May 2021,"I will admit that I am not familiar with the source manga though obviously I am with the Alice in Wonderland. That said, this is great ride, likeable characters, great effects and an all round solid performance.As an aside, I do often wonder about a slight anti Asian bias creeping in on some of the reviews particularly when it comes to acting where it is always characterised as ""wooden/stilted"" or ""over-acting"" different cultures have different aesthetics and cultural norms when it comes to social responsibility and the like, I get the feeling people don't appreciate that...Anyway, if you like a cracking story with overtones of ""Battle Royale"" and ""cyberpunk"" then you will love this, I for one am looking forward to seeing the game masters and the queen of hearts.

pomeranianfurball,Watchable Isekai. Terrible overacting by main lead.,7/10,1 September 2023,"It shows its manga/anime roots. This is not a compliment. The reviews are probably pumped up by legions of weebs.If you can shut your brain off, it can pass the time.Even thought it predates Squid Game, it will inevitably be compared as they have similar themes. It is a poor version of Squid Game without the social inequality commentary and without the good acting.The main lead in particular, Kento Yamazaki, hams it up in every scene. Eyes wide, express surprise and dismay in every scene.If some of the other characters weren't good eye candy it would have been hard to watch the entire run."

lordofthewyrms,2 episodes in and everything is predictable,1/10,15 January 2023,"Every single thing that happens in this show is either predictable or makes no sense. You can watch 3 random dudes going in a bathroom stall avoiding police, which as far as I can tell have absolutely no reason to be chasing anyone. Watching some street worker have intimate relations with her boss, or any other thing that's happened (trying not to spoil). You get to watch this random chick make a crying boy fondle her, like him touching her is enough for him to feel better about everyihing that has gone wrong in his life. It's just bad, the plot is bad, the actors are bad, the CGI is also bad. If you want to watch a terrible horror show where everyone wants to die for no reason, here you go!

Also, the fact that two the main characters die makes the show even more gripping since this kind of thing rarely happens !! and it's almost impossible not to cry at episode three..I really recommend this series if you like anything that revolves around dangerous games. ;)"

moonharuki,it's good,10/10,6 June 2022,"I'm waiting for next season so i can get more information but so far so good. I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are just because they wanted everything laid there for them since the start and in just 1 season when this tv show is based off a manga which has more plot to give lmao.

hotra-22581,I love Arisu,8/10,24 November 2021,"I really liked Arisu and his smartness, especially in the first game ""Dead or living"". His reasoning ability was so strong enough to solve how to know witch doors lead to death and witch not. I was pretty suprised how the ending was so weird. I were thinking that it would be just so Arisu gets an infinite visa. Kinda sad how Arisu's friends died in third episode. Anyway fun series 8/10. GOOD."

lius-70043,A masterpiece to last me a lifetime,10/10,7 July 2023,"Just finishing the show, I can't count the number of times Alice in Borderland has made me full on sob. This show was an emotional roller coaster and I loved everything about it, the characters, however are the highlight for me. The characterization of everyone is deep and through, I ended up caring for practically every single person. Not to mention how morality and trauma are shown, a lot of characters are depicted as morally gray, and have sides that are so decidedly human. You can go from hating a character in a moment, to understanding and even empathizing, with people like Aguni, Akane and even Kuzuryu. Whereas trauma, is shown to be reoccurring, deaths leave a impacting effect on their characters, as we see people like Arisu and Aguni, throughout most the show, are revisited by their dead friends.For viewers I highly encourage you to pay attention to the details, and you'll find wonderfully crafted layers of complexity, like the scene with Hatter (Takeru) with his last encounter with Aguni he calls him by his real name, heavily implying that he was actually there, instead of Aguni's guilt conquering up his image.Alice in Borderland has its flaws and plot holes, sure, (and very dramatic deaths :) but it is so much more underneath, it's exciting plot and mysterious story make it a forever favorite of mine."
claranichols,Mystery and twists in every episode!,9/10,29 June 2023,"I loved this show. I've never read the Manga and knew nothing about this going in. It actually caught me off guard with how gruesome it is. But the reviews convinced me to continue after EPISODE 3. I was SO glad I kept going.In case anyone else finished Episode 3 with a great big, ""are you kidding me?"", Ep. 3 was not a foreshadowing for how the entire series would be, it was setting up a vital plot point for the show. It was so bleak, I almost quit.But then all the mystery started to unfold. We started getting answers. Every game was possible to outsmart and I loved watching the heros figure each one out.The romance blossomed slowly and beautifully. There's wasn't any unrealistic rush to it. It was sweet and romantic which was such a point of light in such a dark world.The only reason I didn't give this 10 stars, is because some of the English dubs translate to an almost silly dialogue. I wish they would alter the English script slightly to come across more smoothly in the English language. But that was my only complaint.I cannot wait for a 3rd season!"
bckiisa,Wish they made this into anime not TV series...,2/10,4 January 2023,"I've read the manga and believe me this series is really really bad compared to the manga.The idea is great (People disappearing into a different world) but the acting is so cringy and there are not enough details like in the manga. In the series, they removed a lot of amazing details and focused on unnecessary stupid details. They also altered some of the good scenes, games, characters' personalities that would make good additions to the series.I kept skipping through the episodes, I couldn't watch the whole thing. Please make this story into Anime, I think it would be great and much better than real-life TV series.I'm rating this 2/10
1 for trying to make a show.2 for the good-looking cast."
bonjrwatches,"Season 2 is awful, sorry not sorry",6/10,18 April 2023,"I thought Season 1 was quite great, and had high hopes for Season 2. I was so excited when Season 2 was announced and started watching as soon as it was released. I thought, ""Wow, surely it can only get better from here, right?""Well, it saddens me to say that Season 2 has been an absolute disappointment. It almost feels like Season 2 is a completely different writer/director. The story, the acting, the games, everything has taken a massive hit and pales in comparison to the quality that was delivered in the first season.Unfortunately, at this point, I am simply way too deep into the story and just want to see how Season 2 ends.

inboxtoaditya,OVERALL SLOW & BORING,3/10,1 September 2023,"It should be titled as ""Alice in BORE Land""
Few elements very illogical & not digestible. Also everyone get hurt but the Bloody Arisu didn't get hurt at all in the entire series this is not the comix or 2d this one is the real one and character played by humans everyone got killed because of BLOODY Arisu but he didn't get hurt at all (he only be beeten once-twice only) this character is so so annoying end even he didn't have any skill that idiot alive till the end (off-course he is the main character so he should be) and most of the good characters who are in an around him get killed and this annoying character still alive, i think if he get killed audience won't feel bad at all.

adam-hills-01476,"Emotional ending, worth watching overall",7/10,9 January 2023,"I really found the ending very emotional and I'm not sure why. I liked it a lot!I think one thing I wasn't a massive fan of throughout AIB is a lack of true character depth and good dialogue. I thought the motives of the characters were all a bit shallow and not that interesting. But Chishiya's development was actually very good. And they brought together the characters really well at the end.Then the ending was really nice and made a lot of sense. It made me quite emotional because I hate it when characters don't remember each other, but then thankfully my romantic side was appeased with Arisu / Usige slightly remembering eachother at the end.I'm really happy they won in the end and got back too :)Overall I enjoyed it but I thought the dialogue and character development was a bit questionable. And it didn't work thaat well as a live action because it was clearly written as a manga. And it did drag on a bit as well. Comparing it to Squid Game - that had much better dialogue and character development IMO - but this was equal in terms of storyline and having a really interesting thought process."

marrsayy,Better than Squid Game,10/10,15 January 2023,"Way better than Squid Game!!! The games are way more creative and better thought out than Squid Game. There are more diverse characters to build a deeper connection with. The back stories are explained quickly without dedicating a whole episode like other series do.My attention span isn't too long but since the games are well done they really captivate you and keep you wanting more. The second season might be a bit more dragged out than the first but it still keeps you wanting more and it doesn't bore you. I haven't read the manga so I can't compare it to that, but the series on it's own is great and I hope there will be a 3rd season.

fedeurso,A really good surprise,8/10,2 September 2023,"This show was a surprise for me, I started watching it and initially I tought that it was similar to Squid Game but in the Season 2 I understanded how deep and philosophical it is.The soundtrack is great and I really enjoied the characters which are introduced in good way. The action scenes are good except the gun fights which are too unreal for me. The games of Season 2 are really nice and fresh becouse they are different and more intricate then those in Season 1.I think that this series could be as good as it is now even without all that violence and blood becouse sometimes it is really a lot and I don't think is necessary for the purpuse of the plot.

juliusbonacker,One of the best series I've seen so far,10/10,18 May 2023,"Alice in Borderland is one of the best series I have ever seen. It has everything that makes a good series: a great suspense, deep characters, a moving love story and you never know what will happen next.In the first episode it was a bit difficult for me to get into the series, but from the second episode on it completely captivated me. The producers of Alice in Borderland have created a truly captivating masterpiece - so good that I will definitely watch the series again in the future.What I liked most about the series is what I find lacking in many series: depth. I was most touched by the story of Arisu and his friends - and of course his touching story with Usagi. But I was also thrilled by the unexpected twist at the end.It's hard for me to do this series justice with my words, so I can actually only recommend watching it yourself."
vrajshah-87931,Brother of squid game,9/10,21 January 2023,"Very nice web series . Nice script . After long time such unique web series came up on Netflix . All cast are awesome. Each of them play there role very well . All the games shown in this are best and unique . Ending of season 1 kept me awaiting for season 2 . Ending of season 2 is quite tricky and totally unexpected . I have to watched it twice to understand ending of it . Hoping for season 3 announcement because at the end it gave us hint about it . Must watch this web series highly recommended. This is my first Japanese web series that I have watch and I just loved it . After watching I have now become fan of Japanese movie and web series .

karlenhalie,Squid Games on crack,9/10,15 January 2023,"I really enjoyed watching this show. I binged it from beginning to end of season two. It's not afraid to kill off main characters, which I like. Often times shows keep the original characters from fear of losing audiences. I also loved that it didn't focus on any relationships. Yes it had love interests or emotional aspects, but it wasn't over powered by characters trying to get together. Hopefully the joker face card at the end means further seasons are coming.The ending of season two wrapped everything up nicely, not what I had pictured... but it was a ""sappy"" ending. If the joker card means there's still one last game, I'm not too sure how they will incorporate the next season. They already woke up in the hospital, no chance that's an allusion."
shuntarochishiya-65776,Best show ever!,10/10,12 January 2022,"The best show I've ever seen! I've also read the manga. The whole show was incredibly well adapted to the manga. On the other hand there's one thing I'm hoping for as a Koudai Tatta fan. Maybe please give that boy more screen time .

haywardrandy,Worth the watch,9/10,16 January 2023,"I was looking for a Squid Game type show and ran across this. It is binge worthy! Great games and likeable characters (sometimes corny, but it works). I will say, it becomes a bit predictable at times, but by that point you're already hooked to the story line. Season 2 is great as well, though it's more psychology based. A couple of the games could have benefitted from being simpler but the characters carry it. It begins losing the Squid Game feeling in my opinion, but hey, it's not Squid Game! If you like shows that keep you in suspense- this is it. Great ending, solid story line, and hopefully there's a season 3!

rthakker-18543,For me this is the greatest show ever made,10/10,5 August 2023,"Highly recommended must watch series. The concept of the series is mind blowing and I think this series is very very underrated so everybody should watch this series this is my most favourite series ever. It is definitely the greatest show ever made the story and the concept of this is very much gripping. Acting performance is also great of every actor specially the main character arisu he has done a fabulous job in acting the series is bit slow but it is very interesting and the concept is fabulous so after every episode it excites you more to click on the next episode and watch it . In short, it is a conceptual masterpiece.

amroha-35576,Ending is disappointing me,7/10,25 June 2023,"I love the pilot of this series but ending is not good at all. There is no meaning of firecrackers in this series. They had to make ending good . Hypnotic by firecrackers that way the are not able to understand what's happen with tham and how they reched there than it's make sens to the story. Good consepcet story and casting all thing are very good. This show is also that type of show that we want to watch and we are expecting good ending of this type of show but they are not make good end. That way i am little bit disappointing with the ending . But almost good show everythig is good . We have to watch it.

projectporter,After episode 4 of Season 1 is where it tanked big time,1/10,8 March 2023,"What was once a strong build of trust among strangers who slowly began to bond and look out for each other, quickly became an abomination. Introduced to a massive resort of Hundreds of people, who seemingly came out of nowhere. From there, it's all parties, sex, drugs, and drinking. The militant portions are just about 3 guys who always carry a AR gun and a sword. The quick random change and sudden progression to this chaotic new place is unappealing to keep track of. It's definitely eye rolling and hard to just continue. I'd say skip this, it's just a huge let down. Much like the ending of GOT.

diogovazalmeida,What a great show,10/10,7 August 2023,"This series has everything good, I loved it from beginning to end.The series has everything you need from love, drama, action, fear. When I saw the first season I already knew that the second was going to be good, I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. The relationship between the characters, the development of each one during the show undoubtedly shows a great work by the director.For all those who love shows with challenges, deaths, messing with your psyche, puzzles this is the series for you, believe me you won't regret it.Many congratulations, a successful show and may more come like this.

ultrafato,"A little slow in a few parts, but overall enjoyable.",8/10,17 June 2023,"Initially, the pacing is perfect until S1E4 or 5. But then the episodes start getting longer... But if you just sigh and let it go, you can just watch. I'm not blaming you for playing it at a higher speed. I did it in a few parts, but I still managed to sense everything the series wanted to give.Season 2 initially felt like a bore, episodes 2 and 3 dragged for too long and I almost lost the will to watch the series. Almost. It was for the better, because everything is compensated in the next episodes, where the long runtime is excused for the character development, including one of S1's greatest antagonists becoming an anti-hero.The games were overall fun and anxiety-inducing, both in S1 and S2. The character development took a little slower time to follow in season 1, but in season 2 we get a deeper look into the characters, to excuse the longer runtime of over 1h.All in all: it was a fun series to marathon. Though if you want to experience it but don't want to feel bored with over-1h episodes, I recommend checking out As the Gods Will."
hasnainali-25116,Alice in borderland is a Masterpiece,10/10,14 July 2023,"Alice in borderland is actually one of my fav web series because of reasons that are following:
1- Story line is amazing with a great suspense and thriller.2- VFX CGI looks ultra realastic.3- Acting of all characters is superb.4- Fight sequence Action Dialogues are amazing
5- Every game is super exciting and interesting
6- you can't feel bored during watching this series.7- Characters use Mastermind techniques for playing games that is awesome.8- Overall Masterpiece Series Must watch .And I Hope there is season 3 of this series because I am connected with characters and I want to watch these characters Together."
kirbabrakewow,Just fine...,3/10,16 September 2023,"-Terrible acting
Immersion breaking scenesCheap character motivesPredictable.The scenario is great and might seem interesting at first, but not much of a logical explanation is provided. The show is asking you to forget what you know and watch it without asking many questions.If you can look past some cringe worthy and extremely dragged scenes, it can be fun to watch.Personally I didn't like it and kept skipping on many time wasting moments to see what's gunna happen.Ending was very underwhelming. I have no interest to see what will follow and cannot relate to any of the characters."
nmt-62732,This show is incredibly stupid.,1/10,2 October 2023,"I seriously wonder what mass metal deficiencies people are suffering from to allow the show to be popular enough to be renewed. I would rather watch paint dry. Magically three friends are the only people left and must play death games to stay alive? Ooooo so exciting.... if you're a simp, maybe. Watched the first episode and first 10 minutes of the second. I spent the whole time asking why this was even green lit for production, let alone why it is popular. How is this what society now finds to be entertainment? The only thing I can imagine is people went into a coma from boredom and the series played in full without stopping.

stefan-milovanovic,Interesting,7/10,4 October 2021,"It could have been done much more interestingly ... It looks interesting like this, but nothing special."
kristinhummel,I Loved this show! More great writing!,8/10,29 September 2023,"I know graphic novels get a lot of attention lately, came across Alice and had to check it out. I really loved this show, they captured the essence of the graphic novel while making it more commercial. I wouldn't have tried it, if it were just anime so now, after seeing how cool things can be, I'll have to try out some anime and see how the stories compare. Ultimately, I think Alice is appealing to multiple generations and type of people because of how story driven it was, and how well written the story was. I'm the one that made us binge watch in a weekend, so would like to find more good stories to enjoy waiting for season 3.

xxugxx,Stupid,4/10,5 March 2023,"Wow where to even begin. Episodes 1-3 were pretty good, interesting concept, somewhat interesting characters and then the whole show just takes a nosedive. Reality and common sense go right out the window. Characters literally get to just pick and choose if they want to die or not, including one that was literally engulfed in flames but didn't even lose his hair let alone his skin and muscles. Everybody can apparently dodge bullets like they're John wick and even if they do get shot it's only a minor inconvenience. I don't even know how they got into this world because I gave up most of the way through season 2. All in all it was a decent concept that was riddled with plot holes, plot armour, and just some really stupid decisions which is unfortunate because I've heard nothing but hype from this show but the more I watched it the more I think people hold some kind of nostalgia from the anime because this was garbage and waste of time."
nourmasri,An amazing series about survival and philosophy of human nature,10/10,13 January 2022,"This is probably one of the best series I have ever watched, it is very original and entertaining.The film quality, acting and script writing is beyond beautiful and it really puts you on the edge of your seat.I also appreciate the changes they made from the manga, as I feel it is an improvement, and I pray that the ending will be changed as well as I genuinely hated it in the manga. Either way, Netflix played magic on the manga and I trust them. I 100% recommend this series.

damienj-01899,I was hooked after the 2nd episode,9/10,2 January 2021,This movie plays with your emotions and does it so well. The story line had me hooked. I feel the 3rd episode was the best and so sad when Arisu's friends died :'(
