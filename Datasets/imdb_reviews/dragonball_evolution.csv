TheLittleSongbird,A contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series,1/10,9 March 2011,"As bad as Inspector Gadget and The Last Airbender are, they look like masterpieces compared to Dragonball Evolution. The TV series was very, very good, the movie was half-baked and bland. The only good thing was James Marsters, while he mayn't look exactly like Piccolo he at least tries to capture the essence of the character. Just a shame he isn't in enough of the movie to elevate it even more.Why do I say that Dragonball Evolution is a contender for the worst live-action film for an animated TV series? The scenery and costumes are nice to look at, but the cinematography does nothing for me, the editing is shoddy and the lighting is dull. The special effects don't impress either, they do distract rather than enhance and it doesn't help that some of them are half-baked.The film is also too rushed, and in all honesty I was left bored by the end, nothing really interesting in my view happens. The story is juvenile and predictable, the dialogue is terrible either being cheesy or due to the delivery very rarely ringing true and the direction is bland. The acting is nothing to smile about, Goku and Yamuka especially are complete disasters and show a complete lack of acting ability. Not only that, the characters here are treated in the most banal way possible and are difficult to like as a result.Overall, a very poor movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox"
DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Dragonball Evolution,3/10,12 March 2009,"Hollywood plundering Japanese pop culture isn't something new. From ""Americanizing"" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.You have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation.For the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period.As far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.Speaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.And the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well (I may get flak from her fans), and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow Yun-Fat's star status could save this, and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.This is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously, despite having to see 6 half-balls, contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters, being continuously flashed on screen, thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe (where's that malfunction when you need one?) Totally bland and really uninteresting, I would suggest sticking to the manga instead."
robin_dhanju-1,A beyond Sub-par interpretation of Dragon Ball onto the big screens.,1/10,24 March 2009,"This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing. The movies attempts to follow the dragon ball story line, meanwhile adding a ""modern"" spin on it (ie. chi chi's castle, and Master Roshi lives in a regular semi whats up with that?). What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters do not look like the cartoons (ie. Yamcha, Master Roshi), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience.

Rectangular_businessman,Even those who aren't fans of the original cartoon will hate this.,1/10,10 July 2010,"""Dragonball Evolution"" must be one of the most pathetic movies ever made. I wasn't expecting this to be like the anime series, I only was expecting this to be remotely good and yet even on this it fails miserably. ""Dragonball Evolution"" combines a lot of predictable clichés and stereotypes from every single fantasy movie from the recent years with terrible performances and horrible, really horrible special effects. No only none of the characters were remotely likable (If the idea was to attract a new audience changing the personality of the characters of the anime show, it fails mostly because this new vision of these ""original"" characters is based on the most uninspiring and bland kind of stereotypes) ""Dragonball Evolution"" is the perfect example of everything what is wrong with live action adaptations of cartoons: Neither the story or the characters have at least a slight resemblance to the source material, the visual effects are extremely poor, the script is incredibly stupid and childish. And the worst part is that not even remotely entertaining to watch, being one of the most boring, generic-looking movies I've seen in my entire life.""Dragonball Evolution"" is like a combination of the Power Rangers and High School Musical. It sucks. If you like the anime series ""Dragonball"", avoid this. And if you don't I still recommend you to avoid this horrible film because is boring, dumb and poorly made.0/10 (And I would rate with a negative score if I could)"
Meven_Stoffat,"So bad it's... well... bad, really",1/10,19 March 2009,"As you may or may not already know, Dragonball Evolution is officially leaked online. Directed by James Wong, the film was released a month early in Asia, and even watching the leaked version is even a waste of time. I watched the leaked version and even then I wanted my money back.So pretty much we see Goku on his 18th birthday, and he gets the dragonball. At school, he fantasizes about Chi Chi eating strawberries in science class (WTF???), opens every locker with his powers, and a whole bunch of other crap. At Chi Chi's party, he fights with these random guys and gets in, when Piccolo, who looks like a potato, destroys Goku's house and kills his Grandfather, and this leads Goku on some quest to get all 7 dragonballs.This movie is a pure suck-fest from beginning to end. Watch as Goku fantasizes about Chi Chi eating strawberries! Gawk at the lame performances from such lame stars as Justin Chatwin (who is ESPECIALLY bad), Chow-Yun Fat, and others! Laugh out loud at the bad dialog! Cringe at the cringe-inducing special effects! Watch as the writers get characters wrong! Or don't. Just spare yourself really.Apparently the official American version has 22 extra minutes of footage. But at this point I don't care, because this movie is already enough torture. What are the going to add? A Bulma/Goku sex scene? A scene where Goku masturbates with that Chi Chi fantasy in his head? A scene where Piccolo turns into a woman and gives birth to a ninja turtle??? A whole subplot involving Piccolo and a sex change operation? With that said, please don't watch this movie. If you have to so desperately watch it, just watch the bootleg version."
Ali_John_Catterall,A load of old Dragonballs,1/10,7 April 2009,"It must be a real drag being a Jungian archetype. Aside from the inconvenience of possessing a thousand faces, imagine minding your own business, practicing judo with some wise and wily sage, when you're suddenly handed a magic sword or glowing swishy stick or cosmic catapult and tipped headlong into some damn-fool quest to go and rescue a princess and kill your dad - no, hang on, wrong shrink - or confront some Dark Lord (who may actually turn out to be your dad, bummer), while also confronting the darkness within your own soul (look harder, not using the recycling bin doesn't count). And the real bore of it all is, the thing that makes you want to stick your arms in a mincer, is that you know exactly what's going to happen next, which charming rogue you're going to meet on the road, which cuckolding temptress you're going to wind up married to for the next 100 years, and precisely which one of your battle-hungry, blood-crazed stepsons is going to do you in with a pillow when you're no longer fit to preside over a model railway set.The story is old, but it goes on. And it's always a pleasure when it's well told. But when plots and characters are as insultingly stock as they are in Dragonball Evolution, you start fervently praying for a bit of Jodorowsky-style subversion, possibly involving the heroine, the Dark Lord, a sackful of syringes and a malnourished donkey called Carlos. This resembles a fever dream you might have had after slipping into an E-number-aggravated blood sugar crash while watching The Star Wars Trilogy. Dragonball Evolution is so derivative, such a bare-faced rip-off of George Lucas' pension, that it actually seems completely pointless to pick holes in it. You might as well just attack the originals for their myriad faults and get two birds with one stone.""In an ancient time, Earth was nearly destroyed"" begins the ponderous voice-over.""Not by man, but by Gods from the sky..."" Most dramas smuggle their exposition in via the dialogue. This one just ram raids it out of the store. For what it's worth, the story involves a young hero called Goku, played by the Westerner Justin Chatwin (slightly creepily playing an 18 year-old at age 26) who embarks on a quest for the titular world-saving Dragon Balls after his martial artist grandpa Gohan is killed off by the evil Lord Piccolo (Marsters, resembling an over-sized Jawa with food poisoning). Will Goku manage to harness the powerful force called Ki and confront his own werewolf side? Find Master Roshi - who trained grandpa in turn? Defeat Piccolo - probably the only villain named after a small flute? And win the love of ass-kicking classmate Chi Chi? Seriously?There's probably a point to be made about the eternal exchange of cultural currency; Japan wresting back characters and plot lines from Lucas, then flogging them to the West again; Eastern aesthetics filtered through American sensibilities. But frankly, that's just the way the world works. The good news is this is only 84 minutes long. And if they knocked another 80 minutes off, it would be just about perfect."
classiccase-1,Even the 7 Dragonballs Can't Save This Movie,2/10,20 March 2009,"For manga and anime fans around the world, the story of Dragonball has to be at the top, or at least in the top 3 of their most beloved manga/anime stories ever written. There is already an existing live action Dragonball movie called Dragonball: The Magic Begins (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122050/) made in Taiwan back in 1989. That movie tried really hard to stay as close as possible to the original story of Dragonball as written by Akira Toriyama, but it ended up being more of a comedy. The entire story also only went up to the Pilaf storyline, which was way before the first Piccolo appearance. This movie, although aged and not exactly a direct interpretation of the Dragonball story, was still appreciated by most fans due to the comedic entertainment value.Now, another live action Dragonball movie has come, called Dragonball: Evolution. When the first few pictures of this movie appeared on the internet, a lot of the fans already predicted that the movie would turn out horrible because the characters don't look like themselves. The characters were heavily changed and westernized too much, especially Piccolo, the main villain, who didn't look like the one from the manga and anime. Fast forward to a few weeks before the latest Dragonball movie was released, a trailer was leaked on the internet. That trailer spelled the certain doom of the movie to the fans of the show. Most of the comments described the movie as ""Not Dragonball, but another action movie"".This writer was fortunate enough to be invited to a private screening of the movie, and boy was I surprised! I was already expecting the movie to be bad and not a ""real"" Dragonball, but what I witnessed was something much more horrible! Granted that the movie was really different, but the way the movie progressed, the introduction of characters, the fight scenes, oh wow, you'd think it was a movie created by elementary kids who had no idea what Dragonball was about, except for the ""Kamehameha"" move and the 7 dragon balls, just with the financial backing of a millionaire. Everything seemed rushed in the movie and characters would just pop out of nowhere and decide to join together to beat Piccolo. The love angle in the story seemed forced as well, everybody was simply out of character. Goku's a powerful but lame school boy, Chi Chi's a martial art school girl who can't even open her own locker, Master Roshi's some crazy dude living in the city (at least he still wears a Hawaiian shirt and seems a little perverted), Bulma became Lara Croft and Rambo combined in another body with a bizarre voice, Mai (originally one of Pilaf's hilarious henchmen in the manga) became a cold blooded, shape-shifting killer, Yamcha became a weird cross between a desert bandit who can't fight and a hobo with unwashed hair, and Piccolo became a weird vampire whose outfit seems to be inspired by the Matrix. I think only Grandpa Gohan was close enough to the original character, except for the way he exits the movie early on.The fight scenes were lame. Dragonball was about epic sized battles that could not be contained in one location. Characters would get punched through mountains, cities would be destroyed, the earth would rumble and split up due to the massive forces of the fighters. In this movie, everything seemed so lame. Even the Kamehameha attack was used to light some candles! Talk about total weakening!The only ""good"" things about the movie were the special effects, although the energy blasts seemed very weak.My advise is, if you're going to pay to watch this movie, DON'T DO IT. Listen to what almost everybody has been saying because they're right, the movie is worse than what you currently have in mind!"
ashtree80,:*(,1/10,29 December 2009,"Yes, as soon as I heard about this movie, I was convinced it would be horrible. I avoided it like the plague. Finally, I wanted to test ""just how awful is awful?"".Upon watching the first 45 seconds of this, I am convinced that it is likely to be the worst ""movie"" I have ever seen. Next time I want to play the ""how awful is awful?"" game, somebody please stop me. Somebody have mercy and take my life before I make anymore poor life decisions of this magnitude."
GirishGowda,Stomped All Over My Childhood Hero & Fantasies..!!,1/10,30 March 2010,"Dragonball Evolution was one of the films which I was terribly excited about. Goku had been one of my heroes all through my childhood. I used to hog the TV whenever it came and didn't even leave the TV for my parents to watch their favourite shows.Goku is humanity personified. He was never a boy who would go after the girl, rather he would go after the bad guys without a damn care in the world for his own safety. He was the reason why I stood up to the bullies in school and never backed down even when I would get beaten up by 4 guys at once. I always thought in my mind that if Goku could be honest, innocent and proud of his actions, so would I be. That was until my 17th year. Then the need to fit in and be cool with my peers when in college took over and all the ideals I had crashed down one by one. But, now I think back, just 4 years down the line, I am more proud of who I was rather than who I am now. That says a great deal about DRAGONBALL - the cartoon. It always stressed about the importance of love in friendships and not exclusively about love with the opposite sex. Of course, there was Master Roshi, the pervert, but it never played a part in how I grew up or how Goku developed. So, to see all my beliefs and ideals get destroyed in the film EVOLUTION, I was heart-broken. I literally wanted to strangle every damn person involved in this film (except for Emmy Rossum. She can do no wrong). The special effects are a joke. Seriously who would spend $100 million on this worthless piece of junk? I'm only glad that I didn't pay for this when it released. It was my friend's treat last year. I recently joined IMDb and had to write a review for this horrible movie.Goku never had teenage angst or crushes. It was fate that he got married to Chi Chi. I've said enough about Goku, there are his best friends Bulma and Krillin as well. In the movie (can I even call this 80 minute headache a movie??!!), Krillin wasn't even there and Bulma was the only one who got close to the actual character. Of course, in the anime also she falls for Yamcha immediately, but in the film, Yamcha's character was dumb. Chi Chi was a joke. Literal translation of Chi Chi is milk or breasts. The whole film looked like it was aimed at kids below the age of 15 and the people more than that age who have not matured past staring at the different breasts at display here. Goku's fantasy of Chi Chi eating a strawberry looked like a sex fantasy. It was disgusting. The story and some characters aren't even in the 400 episode long saga, which is divided into 3 sub-parts..!! The Kamehameha blast was ridiculous. It stomped on my childhood hero and fantasies. I wish they would re-do the whole thing. This is a hateful, irritable movie. Why couldn't they make this like the Batman, Ironman, The Hulk or Spiderman?!! This deserves -100 on 10.. But what to do IMDb doesn't let us give less than 1. So, a 1 on 10 for the actors. They couldn't do much with the terrible script here.1/10"
trevor-johnson,Don't you just hate Hollywood?,1/10,24 March 2009,"From looking at some of the reviews on here, I will keep mine simple as people seem obsessed one way or another. I am reviewing this film on the credits.1. Relation to the original series. 2. Quality of script 3. quality of actors/actresses/acting 4. quality of effects 5. Final product.This film bears two relations to the original. The characters and the Dragonballs. There is nothing else to link the two. This is so sad when you consider how much they had to work with and all they could produce was this. The characters also bear little resemblance to their anime predecessors. None of them do what they are supposed to do, except Chi Chi, who didn't do much anyway. Where's Roshi's turtle shell. Why does Bulma carry several fully automatic weapons? And why is Yamcha now a ladies man? To their credit though, Roshi's behaviour soon after he appears is very accurate even if it is short lived.The script for this film is its downfall. It's just awful. The writers have tried to fit too much into a short period of time. This film needed to be 2.5 to 3 hours long to even come close to allowing all the characters to be fleshed out. Attention should have been paid to Transformers when they were making this film. If you want to make a film based on a TV series, as those who watched it, not a bunch of suits that are paid to watch it and come up with a story. Many people who enjoyed the show could have given suggestions throughout the whole movie making experience.AS bad as the film was, it doesn't take anything away from the actors themselves. They did the best they could with the tools they had. If you ask a builder to build you a house out of sticks, don't complain when it falls over.This film had all the effects of an 80's movie. Think of A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors and the scene where the Freddie battles the kid in the wheelchair. That's the level of effects in this film. And I will leave the dragon, Shenron, so you come to your own conclusions. I don't want to seem prejudiced.This film lands not just way off the mark for a spin off movie, it's in another continent. They should never have made it if it was going to be so lack lustred. It could have been done with a comedy element, which would have saved it, but no. They even try to throw in romance, but you have only seen the characters for an hour so who cares. Why so many inconsistencies from the original anime series? For example, Roshi does not live on an island. All these little details could have been included with another hour of film time. No one wants to watch an 88 minute film nowadays. Its just not value for money. Some may think that 1 out of 10 is harsh, but when they made such a hash of what could have been another Transformers, its all it deserves."
logenbacsi,Worst adaptation ever,1/10,17 March 2009,"This movie was utter crap. It had nearly no connection to the source material at all. The directing was bad, the acting was bad, and the effects.. pf were utterly cheese. 100 million US$ my *****. This movie looks like it was made by no more then 10 mills. Where did the money? Or there wasn't any money from the beginning, and you're just using this movie as a money laundry? Copying Uwe Boll too much? Whoever gave the changes in this movie a green-light was damn stupid. The whole thing's cliché, and relies again on the ""Heroes Journey"". I'd really wish Joseph Campbell would have never done any research on myths and archetypes, because it's his fault now, that every movie is the same nowadays.This movie is really BAD. Even if you never knew anything about Dragonball (impossible) don't watch it, it'll still suck. Even the creator of the original manga (A.T.) said after watching this movie, that he's shocked at how bad it is.Thank you Hollywood, you just bombed my childhood. Now I know how Hiroshima feels."
mikely115,Hollywood is ruining my childhood memories!,3/10,18 March 2009,"This movie is just plain disappointing to say the least. I don't care if this is an adaptation of Dragonball. The only reason why I gave it a 3 out of 10 rating was for the special effects and production value which were semi-decent. I don't understand what was wrong with the original storyline that needed to be changed and messed with. It's the original storyline that made fans love Dragonball in the first place. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."" I think this movie would do a lot better if they stuck with the original story and had better casting. The real fans would flood the theaters to watch it which would bring hype to the movie for new viewers that don't know about Dragonball, kind of like how Watchmen did. Street Fighter was horrible and they expect to do a sequel to it, this movie was a travesty...I guess next up will be Thundercats and Voltron for Hollywood to mess up for me. Thank you Hollywood for ruining my childhood memories.

sweetlittlepie,10 Reasons Why you shouldn't watch this movie...,1/10,10 April 2009,"This movie is not bad, it's awful. The acting is mediocre at best. The direction is bad, the special effects are not very good. You would think that a movie with a big budget would have at least have good special effects, but alas this is not the case. The thing that really bothers me is that this movie had some potential, but unfortunately the bad casting, the overall plot, the dialogue and the acting just weren't there. Here's ten reasons why you shouldn't watch this movie: 1. Bad casting - I don't know who thought it was a good idea casting Justin Chatwin as Goku or Emmy Rossum as Bulma. I think Emmy is a great actress but she is definitely not the right choice to play Bulma.2. Dubious setting - Where does this story take place. It's like some urban/desert place. The setting is way off, and they never do tell you where the story is taking place.3. Bad acting - I have nothing against Justin Chatwin, but it wasn't even like he was trying to act. The only one that I think did a tolerable job was James Masters, and even he wasn't performing to the best of his abilities.4. BAD special effects - Okay the special effects in this flick where laughable and completely not believable. I dare anyone to keep a straight face when Goku transforms into Oozaru. There were people giggling behind me, giggling...Need I say more.5. It's PG - Now there is nothing wrong with PG movies, but when the original material is violent, outrageous and bloody there's definitely something wrong. They took everything that was cool about Dragonball and erased it. They tried to make the movie so family friendly that it lost everything that made it Dragonball.6. Bad adaptation - They got the casting wrong, the characters are all wrong, the actors don't act like their counterparts. The costumes are wrong. Where's Bulma's blue hair? Where's Yamcha's scar? Nowhere near this movie that's where.7. The direction is all wrong - Did anyone really think that James Wong was ready to undertake a project this big? Now I'm not dissing James Wong as a director, I'm just saying that clearly he wasn't ready to direct and helm a big budget blockbuster.8. God-awful script - A script determines whether a movie is gonna be gold or whether is gonna be trash. The dialogue is gag worthy, it's cheesy, stereotypical, and downright lame. Some of the films important plot elements aren't fully explained, and the storyline is all over the place.9. Score - The score is actually tolerable, but it just doesn't fit the storyline, or the mood of the characters.10. Too short - I found the film's length to be too short. Why because there's too much information being cramped in. It's only 84 minutes long, which is not good for a film with so much complex story plot points. The film's length might be why it falls short.I can only conclude that this film is not worth spending ten dollars. If you're still curious go ahead watch it, but know that not only are you wasting money, but valuable time as well."
Leofwine_draca,Lamentable kids' flick,2/10,3 September 2011,"Having no idea of and no interest in the original anime upon which this spin-off film was based, I sat down hoping for a mildly diverting Asian-influenced fantasy saga. What I got was a soulless cash-in with pitiful production values, an absolutely abhorrent script and an over-reliance on cheesy CGI effects over the 'niceties' of quality acting, characterisation or plot.The cast are abysmal and I had to feel particularly sorry for Chow Yun-Fat, who's utterly embarrassing in the expositionary role of the wise old monk. Emmy Rossum once showed promise as PHANTOM OF THE OPERA's Christine, but this type of movie is NOT a good career move. As for Justin Chatwin's lead, well, he's just a spiky-haired prat. Elsewhere, there's an endless combination of leaden dialogue and terribly OTT fight scenes between mutating monsters and humans with superhuman powers. Director James Wong once produced THE X-FILES and directed two FINAL DESTINATION films, but on the strength of his work here I'd say his talent has long since left him."

Occasionally features stunted and disjointed action, as well as the hilarious but quite conventional characters fitting partially to animated series . The abundant computer generator images , which labor mightily to reproduce the source materials in some impressive scenes and eye-popping look . These adventures can be good for novices and youngsters age 10 should drawn into the story but not for the established fans . James Wong adapts the rich myth of the Dragonball series that grew from a Manga into various popular animated series by means of hundreds episodes that are brought to life with this 20th Century Fox and Stephen Chow ( Kung Fu hustler )production . James Wong is a good writer(21 Jump Street , X-files) , producer (Black Christmas , The others , Milennium) and director (Final destination 1 y 3 , The one , and X files episodes) , but his filmmaking in Dragon Ball is ridiculous and embarrassment . Rating : Below average ."
movie-goers,Dragonball Evolution - What a screw up!,1/10,16 March 2009,"What is wrong with this picture man? Nothing personal to James as a director. I love his Final Destination series, but I think James is NOT the right person to direct this million plus dollars franchise. Why James is hired to direct this movie in the first place? It is a big mistakes. Like having Ang Lee directing the Hulk. Hiring an Asian to direct an Asian animation epic doesn't mean the movie will turn out great. The director must have a vision of the given materials. The entire outcome is a disaster and disappointment. It is understandable that the film isn't exactly the same as the original comic, but the characters and the plot just suck as a film on its own. From observing the promotion materials of Dragonball, it seems that Fox doesn't want to do this movie at all. The posters suck and the trailers suck. The studio spends a lot of money on making Marvels and DC comics into movies, look how successful those films had become. The studios should pay more respect and faith in Asian materials. To me this whole thing isn't making any sense at all because there are established fans across the globe, and Dragonball comic and cartoon itself has last more than TWO decades. This is why I think 20th Century Fox was putting money into this project initially. Everyone is looking forward to see a Hollywood version of Dragonball. Soon as I saw the first teaser, I knew I shouldn't put up in any hope into this movie. Even though I went to see the movie without any expectation, the movie still suck! Despite the led down of the Dragonball fans, it creates negative impulses to those who is new to Dragonball.Dragonball is a hot cult in Asia and it hits the western market because of the stylistic action and fight sequences. However, the martial arts choreography in this movie is another led down. Not to mention the screenplay, the production design of this film is not consistence at all. Wardrobes, props to makeup, nothing fits together! Not only nothing in this film resembles the original DB, it is a disgrace. No wonder they use the word ""Evolution"". But when they say evolution, I don't expect the studio turns something respectable like Dragonball into rubbish. I've seen a live action version of Dragonball shot by the Malaysian years ago. Although it is an exact duplicate of the animation. But the movie is far better than Dragonball Evolution. A lot of us are looking for a remake of this movie."
Simon_Says_Movies,"Manages to drain every iota of fun, charm or wit out of the series",2/10,15 July 2009,"Take a childhood memory; a movie, a toy, a song, or most appropriately here, a television show. Now imagine everything you loved about that nostalgic pastime and then envision a lucky break where you were asked to direct a brand new movie adaptation of that piece of your history. And finally, ask yourself, so you think it possible to remove every single aspect that made that memory so special? Could you do it? Would you, as a fan, be literally capable? Well the people behind Dragonball Evolution certainly managed too, as they manage to drain every iota of fun, charm or wit out of a much loved series.Back when I was young I always found a great deal of fun to be found in the anime import Dragonball Z. I was by no means a die-hard fan; I watched only the first few seasons and even as a grade-schooler I could pick out consistent pace issues and gaps in logic. But yet, it was goofy, bloody, wildly inappropriate fun. It would stand to reason a director could draw at least some of the spirit of the Dragonball universe by simply watching the shows or reading the sources material and yet James Wong (who also directed The One and Final Destination 1 and 3) manages to do just that; change fun into camp, over-the-top violence into PG rubbish and alter any of the interesting back-story and lore of the series into an unwatchable tedious origin story.Perhaps I am missing the mark hugely, but vibe of the film is all off, and I assure you I am not an adaptation Nazi, nihilistically picking out every detail not identical to the source material but I just kept uttering under my breath ""What IS this?!?!"" To that end I am not sure who this film will impress. It will surely not draw in new fans, and as you may have gathered, I am of the impression fans will not be too thrilled either. The opening half of the film is droning, tedious schlock, which then gives way to ridiculous camp, which finally falls into an at least half-successful final act. There is also the possibility that Dragonball will simply never work as a live action adaptation, the anime medium just suits the feel and bizarre pleasure of the story and characters.The plot (a term I use loosely) is beyond excusable and consists merely of young warrior Goku (the fresh faced Justin Chatwin), his master Roshi (a mildly entertaining Chow Yun-Fat who must be strapped for cash) a feisty gun-slinger named Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and a creepy hippie conman named Yamcha (Joon Park). Joining forces, they seek to collect 7 mystical Dragonballs, which when brought together grant their holder one wish. But on their trail is the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) and an assassin (Enriko Tamura). The plot suffers further from the bit part from Piccolo which leaves the story with barely a central antagonist, and the plodding pace, unforgivable dialogue and general lack of momentum compile into just a pile of rubbish.The final battle finally brings out the style of fighting most fans are accustomed too, but it's too little to late and an insane twist involving Goku is beyond cringe-worthy. The only thing Dragonball Evolution is good for curing is a leg cramp, because 10 minutes of this film and your legs will be involuntarily shuffling out of the theatre.Read all my reviews at: simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
vas_deferens,"For the love of god, if you respect the original series at all, do NOT pay to see this crap!",1/10,4 April 2009,"Let me just start off by saying that there are no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. The multi-million dollar budget has amounted to a teen drama mixed with power rangers. The final product is insulting, to say the least.The creators of this horrible, horrible adaption should take a good long think about what they have done and why they should have just followed the source material instead of taken it for granted. Do they really think that the entire Dragonball fan-base is this stupid? Akira Toriyama probably has a noose around his neck right about now.To finish this off: The acting is atrocious, the butt-rock scattered through the soundtrack will make you want to punch the guy running the theater in the face, and the story is basically the manga's, but cut up, put into a blender, stuffed into sausage skins, and stitched back together with an American flag tied around it.If you want your Dragonball fix, just buy dvds of the show instead, skip the movie, and if you don't skip it, then at least don't pay for this thing. I heard that a sequel is already in the works, and we don't need a trilogy, that would be three of these movies too many."
benjaminweber,The Sharknado of martial art films,2/10,23 July 2018,"Reading the reviews, it's possible to think that this is regarded as bad purely because of a vocal fan-base for the original. For instance, Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a good film, but thanks to a small group of noisy 'fans' a lot of the reviews online are negative. This is not the case here. I have never seen/read the original, and I still found this to be a bad film. The CG effects look like something from a SyFy original, the acting at times is reminiscent of Neil Breen, and the whole thing comes across as a goofy mess trying desperately to look like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. If you enjoy bad films like I do, it's worth a watch as it will make you laugh at how bad it is. 2/10

Monsoon77,The perfect movie for anyone who hates Dragonball Z,2/10,17 March 2009,"Watching DBE i can immediately tell the directors and everyone else involved have not watched more than a few episodes of the entire Dragonball series. The characters are only similar in name and the story feels like they chewed it up and spit it out and whatever stuck to the storyboard they went with. I wont ruin the story but its nothing like the anime, as i said before the characters are only similar to the anime by name. It almost seems like they wanted to make this movie as bad and as far away from the original story as they could. The only time an actor or actress acts like their anime counterpart is when they are first introduced speaking mainly about Master Roshi and Yamcha.For one of the most action packed animes around they sure did the opposite with the movie. I can count the number of fight scenes with one hand and count how long they lasted with two hands. Its pretty pathetic when the first fight scene with Goku and the ""bullies"" is the best and he never threw even threw a punch. The big screen debut of the Kamehameha is sad and pathetic and all the Ki blasts look like different color fire balls. They don't look pure energy (like they are in the anime) but just like slow motion fire.I could go on for hours about what they did wrong. If you have never seen the anime series don't watch the movie. The story is probably too confusing for anyone who doesn't know the entire back-story of the anime. The movie only gives you the who and the what but no why. In fact i think why sums up the entire movie. Why did they do this and why did they do that is all i was thinking during the entire movie. At the end of the movie all i could do was ask ""Why did they make this movie and who did they make this movie for?"" This is not a movie for the fans or anyone who has never seen the anime. It feels like they made this movie for the people who hate the anime.As a fan of the series I will award this no points and may god have mercy on their souls."
moselekm,How did this come to Theatres? And who signed off on it?,1/10,19 April 2009,"Okay, let me start by saying. At age 8 I found out about Dragonball, I watched the entire season, all the way into the uncut fully Japanese airing of Dragon Ball Z, and then segued into GT. I am 23 now and have long stopped caring about anything ANIME. However, when I caught wind of this, I ignored all the e-chiming in my forums and IM's and immediately located the trailer. Needless to say I laughed and thought it was another Prank (like the Zelda trailer back in 07).So, with that said, know, this is coming from someone who nerded out to Dragonball series for years, and have long since grown out of that liking into almost disliking the entire thing. However I was drawn to check it out anyways.This movie, is probably the worst series -> movie ever made. This movie is good to use to make other movies grand. Ever want to push through a horrible movie just to say you watched it? Well kill two with one stone, watch this one, then go watch the other and you'll have such a biased stance on films in that moment you'll love it. Dragonball Evolution fails on every point.So before I dismantle this movie, I will note one good thing about it. It had: Emmy Rossum. Granted, her role wasn't classy like her other ones, but she is a nice actress to come across, and she brought back sexiness combined with duel wielding pistols.So for the non-nerd people who may go see this for any other reason than ""being a fan (or old fan) of the show(s)"". This movie fails at being anything worth a fighting or action movie. There is one cool fight scene, and I promise you, you can save time and just go watch the clip of The Forbidden Kingdom fight of JC and JL.Sorry, but watching a pasty white boy doing karate is actually insulting to my own eyes. I almost gave up on modern American Kung Fu movies when I saw Forbidden Kingdom, but after watching that weaselly looking Gokou, I have officially given up. We can only hope that Stephen Chow makes another movie soon to give us hope that China is still in the race to make Kung Fu movies.The graphics of this movie reminded me of the bulky techno special effects from Super Mario Brothers. Yea, the one with John John Leguizamo. The energy fights were anything but spectacular. Want an idea of what they looked like? Go watch that Covenant Movie (yes, the one about male witches being cool, right?). Remember the end to that movie with the energy ball fight? Well add blue and red to those balls and there you have it. But dare I say - THE COVENANT MAGICAL FIGHT was more intense, and better done than the DRAGONBALL ENERGY FIGHT.Also, when the characters would produce intelligence on the plot and foreground to background of the history of this world they live on, it sounded worst than your 10th grade history teacher teaching you about Sumatra. It was as if the actors were holding their scripts in their own hands and reading right off of it. Luckily, Rossum, didn't do any explaining, so her image is at least not so tarnished from this movie.Finally, for those wondering, isn't Dragonball from Asia, and don't all the characters from the first and second series have Japanese related names. (I say first and second as Pan and Bra don't really fit). However in this movie, there's only 4 Asian characters. The rest of the characters look like they got lost on their way to the MEAN GIRLS 2 set. (No, there isn't going to be another one. Sorry.) As for old school fans of the Anime. As you can read, this movie lacks anything cool for any outsiders view. The fighting is horrible, the graphics are lame, the acting is atrocious. As for comparing it to the show? They got the characters names right, and that's about it.Just watch the trailers and teasers. You'll be able to see. Even the profound KamehameHa move sounds like it is done by a pubescent teenager.Avoid this movie, at all costs.Note the director's name, avoid that as well."
scorpionlgr,"Overall F grade or 0/10, Save your money! wait until you can watch it online for free!",1/10,20 March 2009,"This Movie plain and simple insults our intelligence, I mean I'm no Geek, but tham they were way off!, this should not even be called dragonball, because of stupid 20th Century Fox, now dragonball is ruined, if someone wanted to make a better movie with the real story that Akira Toriyama made, they made so many changes and mistakes that the dragonball that we know is gone forever, on Watchmen they made some changes but only so the essence of the show could be shown on film, but Dragonball is dead they killed it, I'm sorry Akira Toriyama they ruined your work and about every Anime , and dbz fan out there, like my Grandfather just to say ""there's cheese all over that movie"" It is illogical to spend the money on copyrights if you're not even going to use the story.Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network, originally disgusted at Otaku decrying the film via leaked set shots and trailers even before the movie was released, gave the movie an overall F grade, admitting that ""The fans were right."" Criticizing the films lack of explaining plot elements to its hackmead storyline and lackluster effort by the actors, he suggested that the film ""Might be fun when you're hammered and surrounded by friends. Or suicidal, and need something to push you over the edge."""
bcleverguy,Garbage!!!,1/10,23 March 2009,"This movie is worst than I expected. They changed all the mythology of Dragonball series: 1) the kame-ha-me isn't done like in the series 2) the special effects suck, especially Shenlong 3) to summon Shenlong you must go to a special place, put the dragon balls in some kind of a rock with holes and summon it during the high point of the eclipse (but then Goku summons it after the eclipse!) 4) the sense of time is all wrong: in the beginning we are 2 weeks away from the eclipse but, in the next scene, we're just 4 days away 5) Oozaru appears, not because it's full moon, but because of the eclipse; it is 7 ft tall, it stays with Goku clothes on, and it have no tail!!! And another thing: Goku reversed the transformation like it was the simple thing to do.The only thing I saw that looks like the original series is Master Roshi personality and the way Goku kills Piccolo.This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in may entire life. 1/10"
genstarzz,Speed Racer (2008) ain't looking too bad right about now....,1/10,28 March 2009,"This movie is an abomination and a disgrace to the great anime and manga. The acting is crap and the whole thing is really cheesy, but the worst thing above all are the creative differences made. I am a big fan of the original dragon ball and dragon ball z anime and it is pretty clear what the main flaws are. First, the completely left out Krillin, a central character of the manga and anime. Second, none of the characters look ANYTHING like the did in the source material. They also changed MAJOR parts of the storyline, etc. It's just BAD.I'm pleased to know that the advertising of the movie is pretty damn bad. The less non-dragon ball fans who know about it, the better. I don't want this film to taint dragon ball's reputation.

anifanmc,Easily the worst anime adaptation I've ever seen,1/10,14 April 2009,"Jesus, what a turd of a film.In the first place, it was probably a mistake for an American director to make this movie because nobody outside of Japan is apparently capable of treating manga/anime stories with the proper respect or fidelity. Beyond being a complete mess as an adaptation (I don't have enough fingers or toes to count what makes this movie anything BUT dragonball-related) it's such a bad, bad, bad, bad movie that it's painful to discuss.The plot (I think) has something to do with Piccolo coming to Earth after a long imprisonment(never mind why/how he got out) to try and find the dragonballs, seven mystical orbs which remain unexplained in origin. He sends his minions to find the dragonballs (never mind that he's apparently capable of leveling cities with a flick of the hand) in an awful, comical version of the Power Rangers. Then, enter Goku, the stupid turd of an excuse for a hero, who is (yes, believe me) a teenage kid in high school. I can't even begin to explain how stupid that is. Never mind his origins as a Saiyan. Never mind his training SINCE BIRTH. Never mind that he's got no backstory beyond the fetid, rotting, and stereotypical ""geeky boy in high school who has the hots for the girl who hangs around the jocks"" storyline. Oh, and Bulma is basically a Lara Croft-esquire Tomb Raider. I want to know what drugs they were taking when desiging (read: maligning) the characters for this movie.The rest of the movie involves random, stupid fight scenes which are both completely out of whack with the style that you would normally see in Dragonball and/or DBZ and also inconsistent and useless. You have some chick named ""Mai"" who is apparently Piccolo's evil henchwoman, and then out of NOWHERE, Chichi turns up in some martial arts tournament. I'm not even sure what happened up to this point. Then, they fall into a bloody ditch, meet Yamcha, and waste a good 15 minutes of the movie screwing around (this was, incidentally, one of the few actual events from the manga). The rest of the movie makes so little sense it's unbearably hard to talk about.Seriously, what the hell were they thinking while making this? Were they TRYING to turn out an awful product, or did James Wong have a checklist of ""stereotypical BS to stick into a mediocre movie""? I feel like my eyes need to be cauterized after watching that bilge. Don't waste your money or time on this. PLEASE."
WeAreLive,You don't need to be a dragon ball fan to hate this movie,3/10,21 December 2017,"Look I am not a massive fan of Dragon Ball Z I used to watch the show but afterwords it just got boring and repetitive. Plus some of the character designs in that show looked pretty weird. 
I came across this movie on film 4 and I watched to the end. There was literally no story. 
The acting was bad, yet there was action and most of the cast are american.
But I have to admit the woman who played Chi Chi was cute, beautiful and hot as the character and she was one of the good things to come out of the movie.Overall don't waste your time or money watching this.

gbowles76,God save their souls,1/10,22 March 2009,"I almost vomited when I saw the preview for this movie. It's like taking a child, raping it and then throwing out of a moving car at 80 mph and leaving it for dead. Did anyone in the making of this movie even watch one episode of DB, DBZ, or DBGT? Special places in hell are reserved for asses like this. For one, the whole base of the story is completely off, not that it makes a huge difference because the acting alone is enough to make even the smallest of fans to the Dragonball universe cry and hang their heads in shame. This is nothing but a baseless rip off of one of the most celebrated anime classics and unfortunately more and more movies are heading in this direction. Can we please get a director with a set of balls to direct a movie based on the actual characters and plots of the story they are trying to show?

Screen_Blitz,Total disgrace to the anime series,1/10,18 February 2016,"Dragonball Z is by far one of the popular animated shows ever to hit television, and has left major landmark on the anime genre. This manga-turned anime series was brought to life by Japanese artist Akira Toriyama who brought on air in Japan in the late 1980s before the show made its way to the U.S to become a cult sensation it still remains today. The genesis of the television show is a boy named Goku who travels across the world in search of seven magic orbs (known as Dragonballs) that will summon a dragon who will grant the finders one wish before scattering the orbs across the world for a next find. Along the way, he meets friends who assist on his journey and fight against the evil monsters that stand in his way. Growing up a DBZ fan as a kid, I was exciting about a DBZ, although I was a bit skeptical about live-action adaption to the television show. When a television gets a film adaption, fans want it be entertaining and pleasing to watch. Unfortunately, this adaption to the DBZ series is just a film gone terribly wrong.This film, directed by James Wong, stars Justin Chatwin as the iconic character Goku, a high school student living with his grandfather Gohan (played Randall Duk Kim). On his eighteenth birthday, his grandfather gives a magical orb called a dragonball which can used by the dragon Porunga to grant one wish, but only when the other six scattered across the world are found. When the world becomes threatened by an evil alien Lord Piccolo (played by James Marsters), Goku bands together with martial art master Roshi (played by Chow-Yun Fat), scientist named Bulma (played by Emma Rossum), her boyfriend Yamcha (played by Joon Park), and later Goku's high school crush Chi-Chi (played by Jamie Chung) to fight off against the evil Lord Piccolo and find the dragonballs to save the world from his wrath. What could have been a exciting action- packed thrill ride becomes a horrendous adaption that's plagued by horrible acting, terrible writing, cheesy dialogue, and an overall lack of spirit to the television franchise.It is astounding difficult to describe a massive disappointment this film is, especially for those fans of the TV show. The best way to start maybe the poorly written characters that fall short of spirit to their television counterparts. This story takes the liberties of making Goku into a high school student who develops a crush on Chi- chi which is blatantly false to the original source material. To matters worse, the film plagues the characters with laughable dialogue that sounds like from a cheesy teen rom-com. The performances of these characters are far too lazy to take seriously, and the writings of these characters make them difficult to care for; and for DBZ fans, unrecognizable. Later we introduced to Master Roshi who is given laughable performance by Chow-Yun Fat and awkward dialogue much like the rest of the characters. None of the characters are properly developed, nor the main villain Piccolo who remains one-note throughout the short runtime. As the film progresses, it transcending through a series of story elements that are completely unfaithful to both anime and manga series, and action sequences that should have been redeeming, but fall short of depth, not even closely resembling the fight scenes appeared on the show. Dragonball; Evolution is a total disgrace to the television series, and a major disappointment to fans of the series everywhere. Whether you are a fan of the show or not, this film is definitely NOT one I can recommend. It stands as a definite example of what a television- based movie shouldn't be, and one that fails to stay true to its original source material."
filmmanic99,Student Film,1/10,13 March 2009,"The entire assembly of the film crew and casting is WRONG (excluding the catering and the grip and electric guys). Asia has the first priority to watch such a bad film done by JAMES WONG. Why is he still getting work from Hollywood anyway? ""The One"" was badly done and James is just the worse director ever, I tell ya, he is walking on thin ice in the film industry. He has absolutely no vision of this film. Who hired him anyway? This film is so amateur done that it looks like student film. I can't believe 20th Century Fox distribute a student film worldwide. Btw, did they just put Stehpen Chow's name as the producer as a marketing strategy for Asia? The film ended with a hint of a sequel, and if it does, it will most likely end up re-shooting the entire film (remember of The Hulk). King Piccolo lacks of drive for him to destroy the world. Plot is flat, character drives are lame. Dialogs are stereotype. Ben Ramsey did a poor job as a screenwriter, he is lack of experience to write such an epic movie.Casting: God damn it, wrong cast dude! Carla Hool, please go back home and do some home work first! Who hired the casting department? I recall the same casting director did the Forbidden Kingdom also cast this movie -- Popping AuYeung. She sucks! Did such a bad job casting in Forbbiden Kingdom and in Dragon Ball. I wonder why is she still surviving in the industry at all. Jamie Chung tries too hard to be cute, and she is ugly. Master Mutaito is a black guy? Emmy Rossum was great in The Day After Tomorrow but not in this movie. I can assure you that it's not really her fault, James just doesn't know what he was doing. Eriko Tamura as Mai is just a redundant character, the wardrobe department tries very hard to dress her up sexy while she is not. By the way, her boobs didn't override her bad acting and ugliness. She must have missed Acting 101 class. Visual Effect: At some point of the movie, when Guko turns into a gorilla the visual effect was so poorly done that it looks some what like ""Rubber Chicken"". Did they slip in few shots done by stop motion? The face of Gozoru looks like it was done in After Effects, it doesn't look like 3D at all!! First scene of the film, Goku was training with Gohan, the matte painting of the house was so badly done that it looks 2D (cardboard stand) in the background. Blue / Green screen spill was all over, color correction sucks. Visual effect was done much like fresh grad student level. Hollywood have done so much super hero movies in the recent years, and I think the producers just hire the wrong bunch to do such a visual effects intensive film. I believe that Fox knew this film wouldn't go anywhere so they cut budget from hiring the good guys to work on this film!!!Art Design / Production Design My recommendation is to get Stephen Scott, Simon Lamont and the bunch who did Hellboy to work on DragonBall. The original DragonBall story heavily involves with aliens and action, and I believe that they are the right group of guys to do this film. Their creature designs and makeup fits in this category. Piccolo looks like alien from Mars, one of those ""Mars Attack"" films from the 60s. Costumn in the entire film doesn't match the theme at all, looks like they shop wardrobe from Wal-Mart. The story will be more interesting if it were to take place more into the future (like in the movie Minority Report). The location of Master Roshi's house is totally mismatch to the surrounding backdrop. The matte painting of the city lights and buildings doesn't fit into the picture at all. It is like cut and paste without considering the style, time and place between Roshi's house and the city backdrop.Stunts / Action Choreography: Poorly done dude! One of the marketing factor of Dragonball is the fighting style and its creative art of fighting sequence. Whatever James did, it looks worse than Street Fighter done by Steven De Souza back in 1994. Yeah, Van Damme could've star in this Dragonball movie. The ""ki"" effect is all over the place,the establish shots of the fight covered up by ""ki"" effect and I couldn't even locate the characters on the screen. They add to much vapor on the ""ki"" effect.Conclusion: If you want to have endless conversation with your friends about how bad this film is, then go watch it. I believe that Hollywood is running out of idea and beginning to tackle Asia stories. But studio got to have more faith in selling these stories with huge fans around the world: Dragonball, Akira and whatnot. If you cut back the budget, it will end up with a disaster like what James Wong did with this movie! Consider Matrix, Wachowski Bros did a total ripe off from a Japanese Animation ""Ghost in the Shell"". Look what they can achieve with the budget they've got. Of course, skills is also a factor and they have better vision than James as well.Please re-shoot this FILM!!! I can assure you that all the fans worldwide is looking forward to a re-shoot with different Above the Line and casts"
linkinpark822002,Stuck that Ki and that Kame Hame Ha up your butt Goku,1/10,14 March 2009,"i saw this with my friend on premiere day in Malaysia. I was a fan of the comics when i was still a kid. when i saw the first few clips and trailers on youtube i knew this movie would suck. Who in the right mind would cast Chow Yun Fatt as Roshi and a Caucasian as Goku???? But in the end i gave it a chance and i told myself, ""Hey, let's have some campy fun and not try to think too much."" As soon as the movie starts, and the first line uttered by Gohan, i wanted to leave the cinema hall. In fact after 15 minutes, i wanted the movie to end!!! 90 minutes was just too long. I felt as though it was 3 hours.i'm not trying to be a hater but the problem is that this movie is just too f*cked up. It looked like an amateur movie made by a new director. The dialogues were stupid the acting was horrendous and the plot was terrible. There was no character development at all and they try to make the fight scenes look cool with the slow motion but it's god damn lame. and the jokes fall flat. worse part was the way they try to work out a love story between Bulma and Yamcha within 15 minutes of knowing each other.The Kame Hame Ha scene turned into a cheesy high school love story. I was twitching the moment i heard the lines being uttered by Goku to Chi Chi while he was training his Kame Hame Ha. In fact, i twitched every time a line is being uttered by the actors and actresses.The Climax was downright disappointing with the gigantic monkey you see in the comics look like a guy wearing a rubber gorilla suit. The special effects throughout the movie looked like as though it was from a cheap telemovie. and the Dragon at the end was so laughable that it looked like the Dragon from a rice advertisement in Malaysia.My final say, don't watch this film ever! Not even on rental. not worth your time. If i was to give a rating i would give it a negative but IMDb doesn't allow me to do that."
gigan-92,An Iconic Series Ruined By a Horrific Film,1/10,21 July 2009,"I proudly admit that I have been a fan of Dragonball Z since season one. The mix of brutal action, interesting characters, mystical worlds and great comedy all mixed together to create one of the, if not the best action series EVER!! As a kid I patiently waited each day to see what would happen next and now as an adult I own all the seasons. This anime had fans worldwide ranging from all ages. I admit that other than ""Gundam Wing"" and the Dragonball series I never really was the anime person but somehow this one captivated me, as did millions. And when I heard a film was being made, i couldn't have been more estatic. Until, that is, I saw the trailer. From that point on I knew fans were in for one wretched piece of crap. And on the painful release day my nightmares were realized. Even worse so, really. The film totally disgraced the show and all it stood for. What an insult to Akira Toriyama!! There were so many things that were altered and ended up looking so stupid on screen there's really no point in going into great detail. To say director James Wong had no respect or understanding of Dragonball Z is a PATHETIC UNDERSTATEMENT. This is the lowest rating I have ever given a film. THis film could've been the beginning of a franchise, as so many other adaptations of novels and cartoons alike have proved but I guess now that dream is dead."
xploratio,This movie had potential . The Director never had any.,3/10,19 March 2009,"I saw the movie with not too much expectations.. I am one of the skeptics but for a moment there i kept a certain positivism toward the movie.The movie Is an embarrassment to the manga , the anime , the fans and above all to Akira Toriyama. When I think that the budget for that movie was of 100 Million ..i'm confused of the result.Special effects are OK they're not AMAZING they're just OK .. Acting seems out of place at so many parts ..Parts that are supposed to be taken out are not. you can not deny how bad the script was .. I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DB-Franchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations. However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME ..Its Amazing Cheeziness for 2009 .. But then again thats James Wong for you .I'm not really against the actors and their fitting ..they could've fit if there was a better directing .WE DO NOT WANT PART II TO BE RUINED BY WONG !! MICHAEL BAY/BRYAN SINGER ALL THE WAY!!!!!!"
suprez,Very Awful,1/10,10 April 2009,"Even when you see this movie has nothing else than a movie.It's just plain bad.Was not feeling any synergy between the actor.Yes some special effect are amazing . You expect some decent part when someone waste 100 millions dollars into anything.We know that some stuff can't be brought in the big screen.Especially with reel actor.That why there's anime in the first place.But at least try.Especially if you waste that much money into something.They clearly dedicated this movie toward kids.But the problem is a lot of people that love dragonball are actually quite old.People that grew up with such anime and won't ever forget the epicness of such series. It's like all those crappy video game based on movie.Why they are horrible?Simply because they don't take their product seriously.This is exactly what happened with this movie.

evolvedsky,What a let down,1/10,8 April 2009,"OK so like many people going to watch this film i was a biased fan, though i am a fan of filmaking and understand and was prepared for some changes, its hard to replicate 150 n20 minute episodes into 2 hours.But with an open mind i sat a watched, it was like having your favourite childhood pet tortured horrifically and having a huge company pay millions of pounds to make it happen absolutely devastating.Firstly as a fan i knew the characters well knew the back stories and how they ended up in the predicaments they got into, but i still would have liked some insight whilst watching the film, there was no character study at all i didn't feel at one point anybody had any real existence before the film or even that Goku had been trained anymore than a week of martial arts lessons, chuck in a few acrobatics, but i let this slide at the beginning of the film as it was the beginning of his journey, no he just learn ed a bit of tai-chi and then he knew how to take out a super being that was really peeved he'd been imprisoned for 2000 years, no way? I will admit each actor had his/her moment where you saw the Anime character in them, but that was about a scene each before turning into the American drool we can expect. And as for piccolo he's the least feared villain in any film i've seen he should of had the presence of Darth Vader not Pee Wee Herman, you should fear for your life when you tick him off i got none of that.Secondly the story, well i think there was a story, its too fast too rushed no depth no real insight into why anything they're doing matters okay so there's some big green meanie after the dragon balls, then again who isn't might i add, if i went at this film solo not knowing the story i wouldn't come out any wiser just befuddled plenty of questions. This isn't helped that you don't really know if Goku is or isn't human why he was found ditched in a field how the hell did he get possessed by a weird gorilla thing (which for the fans of the anime thats a lot to be answered for) the anime gave that sense without all the Jargon and changing the origin of his transformation.Lastly and this is for the film makers really, WHO THE HELL YOU TRYING TO APPEAL TO! Special effects won't wash away all the plot holes and appalling crud you try pouring down are throats, the fans wanted to see DRAGONBALL not a film with dragon balls in it we wanted characters we loved watching like Krillin for instance you shot yourself in the foot to take him out along with all the other mythical beings, or everyone thats chasing the Dragonballs throughout Dragonball series, but no you stomped them out because obviously characters don't make a good story, so if you didn't want to take that path why didn't you just change the story completely and be done with it your half way between, no mans land, it could have been Dragonball or something else i think you all just confused youself in not knowing what to make which shows vibrantly.To end Why wasn't stephen chow just given the whole film him and Akira Toriyama together on the script with Chow Drirecting, Wong should never have been considered the moment i finished watching Kung Fu Hustle there was no doubt in my mind who should make this film, but no, OK so he was attached as producer but thats not good enough for me Wong should never have even been considered, so don't watch and boycott fox perhaps after X-men Origins: Wolverine that looks quite good, but then Boycott Fox Thats my Rant Don't waste your money Fan or Not."
Penthus,Disrespectful,1/10,25 March 2009,"This must be the most disrespectful film ever made, this movie shows what Hollywood is all about these days... money..money.. and more money. To take Akira Toriyamas epic story about Goku and his friends and turn it in to low budge wanna be Asian action movie is just unbelievable.. I would be very surprised if the director even had read the manga himself...Dragonball is the one manga who made it's way to the western countries and open the way for other big mangas as Naruto, Bleach, Death note and many more. The Dragonball manga is not only before its time in many ways but also very amusing and always has a got plot and amazingly good designed characters. I really hope no one buys this movie, just to show Hollywood that we don't want your greed hands on epic tales like dragonball... Whats next then, well hey lets take the no 1. manga at the time, Naruto and put some bad acting actors in the movie and lets put an ending to the manga thats not even finished... thats sound great man, much much money there to get.All i have to say is SHAME on you Hollywood... Try to get back the glory you ones had and don't do it by trampling on millions dedicated fans.. This could have been your most bestselling movie this year if you just had put your soul into it.this movie made me sad, angry and numb... but did shred a light on what movie making is all about these days.... pathetic.."
The_Copper_Dragon,This was purposely made flop by 20th Century Fox.,1/10,10 April 2009,"After seeing this one, all I can say is that for some reason they needed a film to flop. At the moment I can't imagine what kind of tragic loop hole in the studio fiscal numbers could have prompted them to do this but I pose the question; why Dragon Ball?!! If for some reason this film was the result of poor research and disregard for authenticity, then both Ben Wong and mainly Ben Ramsey should be stung up by their feet and pelted with bile and human waste. It doesn't even help that they added evolution instead of Z which would have really spawned a violent reaction from a large fan community. Hands down, already one of the top 4 worst film adaptations ever made. Don't waste your money or time on this slovenly ball of Hollywood horse manure. I still don't know why or who gave this film the green light. I mean GOKU IS CAST AS A WHITE TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL!!!! That to me is an indication to forget this film ever existed. This is definitely a bad move for Dune Entertainment. I'd say try the Wolverine film instead of this crap. But even so, why have any faith with the same group the messed up Max Panye, and made X-Men 3. Ha! I don't care if they read this, they need to anyway. DANIEL KAHN NELSON"
njadamjh,disappointed. ashamed. angry? indeed,1/10,17 March 2009,"I felt truly ashamed of being a Dragonball fan after watching this film. i had practically grown up with Goku and his epic adventures. however this was like watching my retarded sibling have a fit in public for 90 minutes. it was awkward and embarrassing. After watching most of the recent Hollywood adaptations of comic books, it is evident that in order for these sort of films to be interesting on the big screen they have to be at least a little bit dark. Well, really if you ask me they should be as dark as possible. Not cheesy and wet like an old towel. Its not even anything like the cartoons! hopefully someone with some vision will give this film a go over because with such a great franchise and such a global fan base it could really be a hit. although even the greatest of directors will have trouble pulling in a decent cast after this train wreck. This really is a c*m tissue of a film. i wouldn't even wipe my arse with it."
Red_Flag,make sure to order the nachos cause there's plenty of cheese.,1/10,9 April 2009,"Who said little green men don't exist? According to James Wong they do and, according to James Wong, they make excellent baddies. He couldn't be more wrong, as our antagonist ""lord Piccolo"" makes his way onto the screen, without a flowing introduction, several sly laughs Eco around the cinema as I hear from one corner ""Do I have to sit through 90 minutes of this"". Fortunately, with the movie opening nationwide tomorrow you still have hope of saving yourself, Lord Piccolo is the very least of this movies problems I assure you. I've heard from fans of the series, a series which i don't watch, that the movies follows the story reasonably closely. Now it's clear why I didn't watch the series. The plot is paper thin a mere excuse for an onslaught of cheesy on liners and attempts at wetting our appetite for the painfully obvious twist that's clear a mile off. You'd think that the director of ridiculous but tense thriller ""Final Destination"" would be able to conjure up the same tongue in cheek playfulness with this. And yet any sense of self ridicule is miles away, it feels almost as if Wong thinks he is making a good movie. So for a good hour and a half we are subject to colors thrown at our face, some of the worst direlogue I've ever had to sit thorough and acting that would shame Keanu Reeves.James Wong adapts the rich mythos of the Dragonball series that grew from a manga into various popular animated series with this 20th Century Fox production starring Justin Chatwin. The plot revolves around Goku (Chatwin), Earth's greatest champion, who must defend the planet against an invading race of alien warriors hell-bent on dominating the universe. Wong directs from his own script, with Kung Fu Hustle's Stephen Chow producing. Buffy the Vampire Slayer's James Marsters co-stars as the film's villain, Piccolo, with Jamie Chung playing Chi Chi and Emmy Rossum portraying Bulma. Hong Kong legend Chow Yun-Fat rounds out the cast as Master Roshi, Goku's mentor in the film. The story develops at a breakneck pace, granted there is little story to develop, while its good to know the movie is so short, the less of it you have to endure.Think back to this time last year, a certain manga adaptation was released under the name ""Speed Racer"" this hard, cold, emotionless shell of a movie sported the same recycled material that Dragonball Evolution does. It's nothing but cutsie visual jokes mixed up with some of the worst dialogue in film history. Our protagonist delivers this line with a stale drone ""I am Goku. I am Oozaru. In order to defeat you, I must be one with myself"" and it's only downhill from there. The acting is all over the place ranging from the over eccentric Master Roshi played by Chow Yun-Fat (who really needs to fire his agent) to the mellow underused Chi Chi (Jamie Chung) who is by far the best actor present. Though I'm not sure whether or not to blame these actors of to blame James Wong for the way he directed them. I've seen each and every person here gives great performances in different movies and it is possible for them to deliver dialogue without sounding like a reject from Street Fighter.Verdict: Tearing through its mystical, who-gives-a-toss storyline like a drunk bat bouncing off cave walls, Dragonball's cocktail of cheap effects, eye-rolling clichés and dismal direlogue will have fans of the series condemning it as a beyond-lame failure. Dragonball: Evolution is so lazy and cheap in every aspect of its execution that the end result is almost unwatchable. It's clear no effort has gone into yet another Fox production - The Day the Earth Stood Still anyone? - why anyone would pay to this is beyond me, if your forced however, make sure to order the nachos cause there's plenty of cheese. For my overall rating I give Dragonball Evolution 1/5."
TheMovieDiorama,"Dragonball Evolution made me ""Kamehameha"" my TV.",1/10,15 January 2019,"Listen, if you're going to adapt a thirteen episode season of a beloved anime into a film that is less than 80 minutes long, atleast try to capture the essence of the source material. Ladies and gentlemen, what we have here are shoddy cosplayers reenacting a script that was clearly written during a short lunch break as the writer was watching a completely different anime at the time, because sweet starry balls this was not 'Dragonball Z' at all! A white American Goku must find seven balls so that he can make a wish, which in turn will stop the evil forces of darkness. Let's re-visit some ground rules. First rule: if you are creating a western adaptation, ensure you don't succumb to whitewashing. Either have an all-white cast or not at all. Making the lead protagonist white and the supporting characters Asian is an insult to fans, audiences and the source material. Second rule: Authenticity. Stay true to the source material and don't, oh I don't know...make a complete left turn by butchering an already simple story. Third rule: cast decent actors. Not even Yun-Fat with his absurd overacting could provide a distraction from the woeful acting on display. Final and most important rule: make a good film. When the best scene of the entire film is Jamie Chung getting unexpectedly donkey kicked in the chest (unintentionally hilarious!), something isn't quite right. Goku has all the charisma of a restless sloth. The fighting sequences were plagued with half second jump cuts. The story was uninteresting and not even remotely developed. ""We need to find all seven dragonballs!"" 5 minutes later... ""the enemy have all seven dragonballs!"". Goku transforms into what looks like a werewolf, not an ape. Goku didn't care for his grandfather (still doesn't). Goku effortlessly lights a candle twice, but fails the third time. Goku beats up his future girlfriend and she doesn't care. Goku looks like a discount Aaron Paul. Goku is in this. This film is 79 minutes too long. I'm done. So, essentially, avoid this fan made film like the plague."
megatom5,Evolution more like Devolution,2/10,12 April 2009,"I'm almost glad this film exists not because it's good in anyway but because of how bad it it. And I find that the terribleness of this title has everything to do with the Hollywood studio system in particular FOX STUDIOS. Throughout the years Fox has obtained many notable franchises and completely crapped on all the mythology and character building those series had, and instead making a base level POS turd that would make them a few millions. Case in point all the Fantastic Four movies, Alien, Predator, and X-men. Now they slide their slimy hands into anime. making one of the sorriest excuses of a film I've seen in years. Yeah the characters have the same names and there are winks at the series for fans but the essence of the series is never captured and the entire film feels like western studio drivel. And honestly I find this inexcusable. Granted i wasn't expecting some great storytelling with a Dragonball movie as the show was mostly driven by the action. But come on what the hell is this movie? I hope no one pays to see this, more than that I hope no one ever sees this. I saw this film for free and wished I hadn't wasted the time. My advice steer clear of this flaming Kamehameha of $###."
kmm1128,I think we've got our first Razzie nominee of the year,3/10,15 April 2009,"Don't get me wrong, Hollywood. I realize how difficult it is translating an anime into a live action film for a massive audience, but rule 101 for every movie should be that it has a good story behind it. Dragonball: Evolution not only doesn't have a good story. It doesn't really have ANY story. Substance was definitely sacrificed for special effects and fight scenes for this movie. But the problem is that the fight scenes aren't even that good. The fight scene between Goku and Piccolo had me laughing the whole time, and the final scene where the dragon is finally shown is abysmal and left me longing for the good old days when Stan Winston was still alive. I mean, did these special effects artists have ANY sense of scale? The actors, save Chow Yun-Fat, who was the only thing keeping me from walking out to the box office and demanding my money back, all sound and look like rejects from ""The Karate Kid"". Although the guy who plays Goku is kinda cute, girls. But I don't blame them so much as I blame the script (or lack thereof) they had to go on. None of the characters are given a sufficient amount of back story. Most of them don't really have ANY back story. Bulma and Yamcha (literally) just popped in out of nowhere. I don't think Mai's name is ever really spoken in the movie. Piccolo only has about seven lines of dialogue and acts like he wants to destroy the universe just for the fun of it. In fact, there's so little explanation as to why everything is happening that only DB fans who read the mangas or watched the series religiously will be able to understand the movie or even care about it (but from what I've seen on the boards, even THEY don't care (don't worry guys, the feeling's mutual)).Worst of all, in spite of the emaciated script, the one-note characters, and the cartoony fight scenes, this film still managed to leave a lot of unresolved issues. It felt like a starving third-world country child leaving the table of a ten-course banquet held in his honor before the amuse bouche even arrived! I mean, how does that even happen?! Trust me all you DB fans who haven't quite heard the news yet. You're much better off sitting down at the couch, microwaving some popcorn and popping in your old DB/DBG/DBZ tape or catching up on your mangas than you are wasting ten bucks on this movie (unless you're just REALLY into Chow Yun-Fat)."
planktonrules,I never saw the show nor played the game...and this film certainly doesn't make me want to either!,3/10,28 May 2019,"""Dragonball Evolution"" has a great distinction. It's currently #20 on the infamous IMDB Bottom 100 List...the list of the worst rated major release films. This isn't totally surprising, as the list currently has quite a few films based on videogames*....such as ""Street Fighter"", ""BloodRayne"", ""Alone in the Dark"", ""Super Mario Brothers"" and ""Far Cry"". But it does boggle the mind to try to understand how a studio can throw this much money at a film project and STILL come up with garbage. For $30,000,000, they created a film that's lower rated than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""!!Goku** is a high schooler who as been trained by his grandpa to master his great fighting skills...though Goku has been sternly instructed to hide these skills and not fight. But after Grandpa is attacked by forces of Lord Piccolo (some weird green guy who looks like Gazoo), he tells Goku to find Roshi to tell him that Piccolo has returned. Then, grandpa assumes room temperature and Goku goes on his quest. Soon he picks up some compatriates and hopefully they can successfully stop Piccolo and whatever naughtiness he has planned....and part of that involves Piccolo finding all seven dragonballs.What follows is a film that is just about all fighting...one fight after another after another. The plot, what there was of it, I found confusing*** and the dialog was often rather dopey. And, speaking of dopey, this film repeated one of the worst cliches. In ""Star Wars: Episode 3"" you have young Vader fighting inches from lava without even breaking a sweat or spontaneously combusting....and the same occurs here.
Overall, a confusing and bad film with a rather anticlimactic ending. But I also think that it's not quite Bottom 100 bad. I think the reason it made the list is that lovers of the franchise were so angry and disappointed in the film they tended to score it especially low. Still, either way, it was a poor movie....at best.
*Yes, I know Dragonball was also an anime...a very popular one at that. And the fans of the show apparently were NOT pleased with this film...much like they were when ""The Last Airbender"" came to theaters.**Why does Goku look like a typical American teen and yet grandpa is Asian? What's with that?!***Maybe fans of the show/videogame won't be as confused as me. I just found the plot to be a mess."
Jackpollins,"Should have never been made, even if they had to kill someone not to make it",1/10,30 July 2009,"Let me clear this: I was not a fan of the animated series, Dragonball Z. That said, I thought it would be a cool idea to make a live action version of the film. I was wrong. This not only did not meet expectations, it is one of the worst movies of the year so far. The story of Goku (Justin Chatwin), a bullied high-school student with some extraordinary powers goes beyond nowhere. This has no special effects, no real action (unless a locker opening is considered action to you.) Goku, after finding his grandpa dead enlists the help of Master Roshi (Yun Fat-Chow, a good action star, wasted here.) Even Fat-Chow doesn't provide a bit of action or fun. Another question is what's up with Justin Chatwin as the star? Goku was Asian, Chatwin is white and American. When you boil it down, it's a dumbed-down, non-action action film, a movie so bad I almost ripped the screen in the theater. I was surprised priests weren't in the theater throwing holy water on the screen. Yes, action movies can be as dumb as they want, but when an action movie has no action, that's the limit. I would have been happy with a dumbed-down, pretty action filled, fun action film. I would of been happy with a grade B- film, but the film doesn't even exceed that. Instead the film flimsily walks around with stupid jokes and a boring story told like a romantic chick flick instead of an action film. The only film's message is if you're being bullied in high school, it would help to be able to do the things Goku can do (whatever they are, since they never show any of them.) Ba-zing."
dbzlamprotest,Protest!,1/10,15 March 2009,"Hello VEGETA_DTX here.In this comment I am just gonna do what I always do...I am gonna explain why this atrocity insults and rapes us DB fans while relying on the simple healthy physical logic(like I like to call it)First and foremost: On one side we have Dragon Ball, a MIRACULOUS MASTERPIECE made by ultimately respected Akira Toriyama Sama. And whoever read it or perhaps watched the animated version or both, perfectly well knows that Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z(and even GT, which I personally don't consider as a DB franchise) are all preaching the SAME messages from the day DB Manga came out till the end of the GT. Those things are: -Purity -Innocence -Justice -Moral -Pride -Fighting for the good causes -Power of friendship -NEVER giving up -Doing the impossible -Beating the unbeatable -Forgiving -Anti exploitation/torturing of the innocent(remember the Red Ribbon army) -Parodying wrong things such as trends, molds, elitism, snobbishness, fame, money and materialism...(best example - events with Mr. Satan) -All the positive and good things!These messages were always floating around the course of this beautiful franchise...We FANS of it, all these years enjoyed it so much, we meet so many new people and found so many friends thanks to this miraculous franchise. We love Dragon Ball world for its indescribably unique, perfect, crazy-hairstyled, edgy, spiky, and like I mostly like to call it ""aerodynamic"" artstyle! :) are in the same time admiring it for all those messages that it preaches...for all the hope and inspiration it brought to us even in the most depressed moments of our lives, for all the scenes, starting from the funny and goofy ones to the serious, ultra powerful fight scenes...Dragon Ball was, at least for me, the ultimate stream of hope and inspiration whole my life...NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE we have something that is almost LITERALLY the ABSOLUTE OPPOSITE of what I described right now...its called ""Dragon Ball Evolution"". It still dares to bear that title and use those names while ultimately contradicting to DB and therefore ITS AN ULTIMATE INSULT FOR MANY OF US AND ITS DESTROYING AND RAPING OUR BELOVED DRAGON BALL! How is it so much destroying it? and how is it the absolute opposite of it? you might ask...(though I really think its ultra obvious), well here is how:-That brilliant artstyle of Toryiama Akira automatically falls into water by the Live Action idea alone(sorry to those who actually like the idea itself, but I personally dislike it).-Story, messages and the overall point of DB, not that its totally missed but its like I said - ALMOST LITERALLY OPPOSITE OF THE DB WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE! And here are only several examples from the trailers, synopsis and leaked videos that I've seen/read so far:-""Goku"" does not remind by any possible aspect visual/audio/personality-wise of Goku we all know and love...not by any possible law of physics nor any other law or logic. -""Goku"": ""I am not ready for this""!?!?!?!?! -""Goku"" goes to high school!?!?!? -""Goku"" is stealing the girlfriend of some high school Carry Fuller guy... and vice versa...!?!??!?! -""Goku"" is wearing the trendy clothes instead of his martial arts GI'sThe first note stands for ALL THE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE! AS WELL AS THIS WHOLE MOVIE DOES NOT EVEN REMIND OF THE ORIGINAL DRAGON BALL! if you exclude the title names and Dragon Balls.Now if you have a healthy logic you will understand why we feel that much insulted by this atrocity.Therefore IN MY OPINION if you fallow the simple logic its obvious and clear as a day that ANYONE who supports this AWFUL, DISGRACEFUL AND BLASPHEMOUS PIECE OF EXPLOITATION AND CHILDHOOD RAPE is automatically NOT a DB fan AT ALL to me. You can try to prove your fandom with your action figures wallpapers and all the materialistic stuff, but I don't care! that is NOT the measurement of fandom to me, but WHAT IT IS a perfect filter of fandom to me, is a state towards something that RAPES the DB(THIS MOVIE), and IF YOU FAIL AT IT, nothing else matters to me! that's all I need, thats a perfect proof that you never was a DB fan in the first place, or you WAS but somehow this materialistic world of today spoiled you and eat your brain(which AGAIN contradicts to what DB preaches!).Therefore we even formed the protest site and petition and are currently focused on stopping the sequels and ANY FURTHER FRANCHISE based on this AWFUL ABOMINATION!Thank you very much for reading! and I hope that in the end all the pure and brave efforts will not go in vain and will pay off somehow and someday, just as every evil deed will have its price! ;) (that's what DB learned us through all these years anyways! ha-ha! :D)Kami bless ya! :P"
halobluecat,If you have any respect for Dragonball...don't see this!!,1/10,24 March 2009,"First let me start by saying I have been a Dragon ball fan for almost all of my life and it it by far my favorite anime series. I greatly respect Akira Toriyama for his amazing work. With that said, When I first heard about the development of a live action version of dragon ball I instantly thought it was a bad idea and feared it would rape the series....and it did. I started watching this movie with such low expectations that I figured I might be able to find a few good things and laugh at the attempts to make this movie. As i watched it I became so enraged and confused at how much you could mess something so big and clear cut up. I guess they were going for realism but this is dragon ball here, the fans don't want realism, they want what they have grown up with and love about the series and none of it it here. The fight scenes in the movie are terribly done and hard to watch. The best fight scene was between Goku and the bullies from school and he didn't even throw a punch. The studio spent one of the highest amount of money on special effects ever and it seems like a student did it. The ki blasts look like fireballs with smoke around them. The kamehameha wave doesn't even look like energy, it looks like a spray of water shooting from Goku's hands. All the characters in the movie were messed up. I mead how f***ing hard is it to make Bulma???? And Piccolo??? I just don't understand how the actors after reading the manga and then the script would really do this. Its almost painful to see this movie. The most disturbing thing in my view of this movie is when Oozaru the giant ape is shown. The transformation is done very wrong and it looks like a man in a suit.If i could rate this movie a -10 out of 10 i would. If you do see this don't say i didn't warn you!"
KayMcDaniels,Dragonball Meets Micky Mouse Club,2/10,10 April 2009,"Upon hearing that there was to be a Dragonball movie made, my boyfriend and I were excited to say the least. As we watched the movie develop here on IMDb we were further and further disappointed. Robbie from War of the Worlds was Goku?!?!?! Christine from Phantom of the Opera is Bulma?!?!?! Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer is Piccolo?!?! The only person we were pleased with was Chow Yun Fat starring as Master Roshi...that pleasure soon turned into pain. Meandering Wal-Mart one day, we saw the new figures for DBE. Why oh why is Yamcha's hair blonde? Bulma doesn't have blue hair, but Chi-Chi had some nice cleavage shots within the movie itself.It seemed that only Chow Yun Fat has a memorable career before this movie, not including teenie-bob movies.The worst part of all is that when we were walking up to the theater, there was a large group of teens and pre-teens waiting to buy tickets to the Hannah Montana movie, which also premiered today. In the viewing room, there were only 15 to 20 people, tops.As a movie completely separate from Akria Toriyama's original vision, it wasn't completely horrible, but if you compare it to the actual series itself, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!! As my boyfriend worded so strategically, Goku's character could have been better translated as an older version of Gohan, or even Goten, not an 18 year old Goku."
RainDogJr,"If there is a God, James Wong, Justin Chatwin and company will burn in hell",1/10,9 April 2009,"We all knew it, didn't we? We all knew how awful was this movie just by seeing the previews, we all knew we were going to hate it and now after seeing today in its opening day (in Mexico City) I can say I didn't found any kind of surprise, I hated it just as much as my cousin, one of his friends and my uncle who saw the movie with me and who like me are fans of Dragon Ball. I must say I have never read the manga but definitely the anime Dragon Ball and mostly Dragon Ball Z are part of my childhood so certainly I wanted the see this live-action movie, directed by James Wong and produced by Stephen Chow (I love the 3 films I have seen of Chow: Shaolin Soccer, Kung Fu Hustle and CJ7. A shame he has a credit here), even with the fact that, like I wrote, I knew it was a f****** abortion. Anyway, of course you don't need to be a Dragon Ball fan to hate this movie, extremely poor acting everywhere, awful special effects, etc. For the Dragon Ball fan this is sad because of everything, why while a Canadian and an American play Goku and Bulma Yamcha is played by a Korean and Roshi by Chow Yun-Fat, certainly the cast selection is awful, none of the actors look not even a little like the characters from the manga. Well I don't want to write a lot more about this movie, just stay away or you will suffer by having a 18 year old Goku who goes to parties and stuff and well lots of other ridiculous moments (also the random use of slow motion but only during the first parts of the movie). And of all the hacks from this production the only ones that may not burn in hell, if there's a God, are certainly Stephen Chow and Chow Yun-Fat but only because Stephen Chow has made such fantastic movies like Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle and Chow Yun-Fat appeared in Hard Boiled (yes I have still to see The Killer and well the rest of movies with Chow Yun-Fat except this one certainly, Hard Boiled certainly, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and Curse of the Golden Flower). I'm p*ssed off!"
remo-pellegrino-1,Why? Whyyyyyyyyy?,1/10,1 May 2009,"This film was bad! I am not going to talk about the acting, the cinematography, effects etc... All my previous posters have already made an excellent report!But please, why insult the coolest person in the DB-history?Goku should be the bringer of happiness! He shouldn't be worried about letting someone down, he is the one to take actions! He is the one to go 100% to become the best fighter, only thing to let him down is his lust for food! He shouldn't be introvert like in the movie: If someone runs over his bike, he ought to say ""Hey, that's not nice!"" or something like that. The ever-happy brat-like fighter as we know him, is not in the movie :( instead, we have the archetype of the outcast teen-hero...This is just the beginning of all the errors concerning GOKU, but hey, it's the message that's important :)"
Adamjomi222,I want my life back,1/10,14 March 2009,"Dragonball lovers around the world, please, hear me now! Are you excited about the new Dragonball movie? Have you been waiting for years for that mystical dragonball live action movie to come out? Are you excited about this movie? Well, go out, find the director of this movie and slap him in the head for wrecking what could have been one of the greatest movies of all times for us DB lovers.Let's start at the beginning. Goku... a teenage kid who actually seems a little too cool for school and, you know what? He's totally weak. He seems weak, he looks weak, are you expecting him to be amazing? The Goku who just keeps going forward and keeps KICKING ass??? Well this guy seems like if he gets hit, he's going to wet his pants.And Piccolo, what an embarrassment. Whoever did his makeup needs to get a new job, because I almost lost it laughing when I saw him.OH and at the end of the movie, when you see Piccolo being nursed by some random woman who has no point in the whole story? He's PICCOLO for god sake, not some old man in a nursing home.There's a reason dragon ball has become one of the all time greatest stories and that's because the story... wait for it... IT'S GOOD! So don't mess with the formula, take too many liberties, KEEP IT TOGETHER AND KEEP IT REAL.I have to go now before I go and hit something for wasting my life with this movie.Bad acting, bad story, bad everything.Peace."
Quebec_Dragon,Dragonball devolution: poor attempt at capturing the charm of the manga,3/10,23 May 2009,"I've read the full series years ago but I'm not a big Dragonball fan nor do I care very much how close the movie is to the books. However, I do care about whether a movie is good or not. It started out kind of OK with a fun training session between Goku and his grandfather (shades of Karate Kid) and not long after with a clever ""fight"" where Goku wasn't actually allowed to hit the bullies because of a promise. I had hope then it wouldn't be as horrible as the reviews and trailer made it sound. This hope didn't last long as things progressively got worse and more boring. That fight with the bullies was actually the best fight of the movie. The few others were badly shot (especially the lava scenes), unspectacular and short. The plot was a mess of clichés riddled with unexplained happenings. I'm still not sure what the villain's motivation actually was.I didn't really care about the characters and the acting was nothing to write home about. I thought the guy playing Goku looked the part (even though he's not Asian) and did good until the last part where his acting was deficient. I thought the villain Piccolo looked cool (James Marsters always does a good intense villain) although unfortunately he doesn't do very much. The secondary characters were not particularly memorable, even Chow-Yun Fat hamming it up. With such an expensive movie (100 millions apparently), you would expect the special effects to be somewhat decent even though the rest might be lacking. Unfortunately,they were lacking in terms of quality, scope and awe factor. Too often, they felt low-budget or b-movie grade (witness a particular transformation near the end). If they had at least gotten the silly humor, the quirky characters or especially the fights right, it would have redeemed the movie somewhat, it would not have been such a loss. If you're a big Dragonball fan you are likely going to hate this ""evolution"", if you're not, you'll likely find it boring and senseless after the promising start. If your expectations are really low (and face it, they probably are), then you might find it somewhat entertaining. This is a poor attempt at bringing a potentially huge franchise to the big screen.Rating: 3 out of 10"
stormhawk2021,"I hate this, and I think that Taiwanese version of ""Dragon Ball"" (1992) is ""Alright for what it is""",1/10,14 July 2017,"I'm not a Dragon Ball hardcore fan, but the main reason that I'm writing this is because there's a lot of positive comments saying ""Absolutely Good Movie"", ""Creative and Clever Story"", ""Honestly not bad film"" or even ""Why isn't part 2 coming out?"" (left by a guy who blames those who tell the truth of that movie), etc.; and I'm worried about IMDb being sued for false advertising if it is left there. This movie is only fun for yourselves if you've been smoking some particularly strange and illegal substances.Dear God, this movie stole from Star Wars, The Matrix and The Last Airbender! In short, DBE makes the Taiwanese version of ""Dragon Ball"" (1992) look like a Greek tragedy in comparison. Yet it still ignores the source material. The CGI is crap, the special effects looks taken out from the Power Rangers, the dialogue makes Batman and Robin look thoughtful, and the characters... Goku is about as emotionless as a bag of rocks, and Yamcha looks like ""a tiger with Down syndrome."" This movie works as an insult directed towards Akira Toriyama and his fans...and directed by James Wong.For this example, I will be using a well known story, ""The story of Jesus Christ"", but I will do to Jesus' story what the writers did to Dragon Ball:Jesus Christ was born in California and went to Henry Austin High School. He used to get bullied growing up. His mom, Mary was a full time nurse who never had any time off. Jesus had some powers, but kept them hidden from everyone. One day Jesus went to a party. Everyone was complaining about there being no alcohol. Then Jesus used his power to turn every beverage in the fridge into beer. Then everyone thought he was super cool and got drunk. Suddenly Jesus was now the cool kid in school.You get the idea. But this is how bad they butcher the DBZ story. Just, kill this movie please. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. Avoid this movie at all cost.P.S.: For all the positive reviewers, ladies and gentlemen, Billy from SAW is waiting for you in the next door theater, and he is pleased to present a sissy and rather bad anime named ""Super Doll Licca-Chan"" (WARNING: This anime show *for little girls* will make a permanent brain damage). As you watch this anime, and in the locked theater, you will try to survive to find the key, while Billy will release poisonous gas and after will set ablaze the theater. So, live or die...make your choice."
yabuturtle,It's not a movie...it's an abomination.,1/10,29 March 2009,"OK, I thought it was gonna be bad when I watched it but man...I didn't know it was gonna be THIS bad. Why did they make this? Did they even watched the anime series or read the comic?? Even the title isn't good. Evolution? Evolution to what? What's evolving? The only thing they got right was their names and the fact that there's 7 Dragon Balls. That's it. Everything else is seriously screwed up. I know movie adaptations are always gonna be a little different from the original in some way. (A character did something in the movies he didn't do in the original and vice versa, settings might be a little different, characters might have different personalities), but THIS was almost completely different from the original. At least they had Master Roshi have a porn magazine, even though he didn't really act like a pervert Bulma acted like a super spy than a geeky girl, Yamcha was a jerk. (I know he was a jerk in the original too, but he was likable) He also looked like a frigging drag queen. Chi Chi was just stupid, plain and simple. Piccolo was a vampire. I know he wasn't literally but he may as well be, since he didn't look anything like Piccolo, who had green skin and antennae. He looked like a vampire straight from the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which is weird since Jame Marsters played one too. Except here, he looked gayer. As for Goku, his hair could have at least been black. Where was his tail? Why did he turn into a half werewolf half monkey instead of a REAL Oozaru? This one was big, but the real one is supposed to be the size of Godzilla. And where was Krillin, Tien and Chioutzu??? Why did Goku trip out every time he saw a Dragon Ball? As far as I know you don't see visions when you look into a Dragon Ball. The camera work was awful and disorienting and the plot felt really rushed. I must point that out that half of the time I had no idea what was going on. Why were there 7 mystics that created the Dragon Balls? I thought it was one guy, and he wasn't even human. I'm talking about Kami of course. There are just SO many things wrong with this movie that is is physically impossible for me to list everything wrong with this god forsaken piece of poop. Even if it wasn't based on Dragon Ball, it'd still suck because of the clichés, the stupid plot, the bad actors, etc. This film will steal your soul and take a dump on it, even if you're not a fan of the series. It was especially painful since I am a big fan of the Dragon Ball series. I kinda regret seeing this but I had to see it to see if it truly did suck. And it did. The fans were right."
mehungy,It's just plain sad,1/10,26 March 2009,"I don't understand how people can consider this movie to be part of the dragonball franchise. Taking MAJOR characters out IS NOT a MINOR adaptation, it is just plain stupid. This movie is just fox trying to make a quick buck and they don't care what they rip off. I'm a HUGE fan of Toriyama and when i heard that he isn't even involved in the writing of the movie i STARTED to have doubts. When i saw the first trailer and i heard gokus character say ""I don't think i can do this"" I pretty much lost all faith in the movie. It's an insult to toriyama it's an insult to the franchise and it's an insult to the fans of the dragonball series. Goku is a highschool student while in the series he'd never even met a girl before. In the series he didn't even know the meaning of the words ""give up"". Minor adaptations i can handle but this is just plain sad...

RichardSRussell-1,April Is the Cruelest Month,2/10,11 April 2009,"April is the cruelest month. Get all excited by trailers for X-Men (May 1), Star Trek (May 8), Terminator (May 21), Night at the Museum (May 22), and Ice Age (July 1), then THIS is the ""feature""?I guess Dragonball Evolution was based on some manga epic that got turned into a video game or TV show or something. If you weren't familiar with the original (as I was not), this flik doesn't go out of its way to bring you up to speed.The ton of money that obviously got thrown at the special effects can't offset horribly trite dialog delivered in wooden fashion by semi-competent actors or the half-dozen el-cheapo sets that look like refugees from the collapse of the housing bubble. Chow Yun-Fat and Emmy Rossum (Christine from Phantom) evidently try to be good sports by acting down to the level of the cardboard cutouts around them. Randall Duk Kim (founder of American Players Theater and the Keymaker in The Matrix Reloaded) is good as Grandpa Gohan, tho.The good guys (including 2 inexplicable Occidentals) are trying to recover all 7 of the ancient dragonballs that will keep the evil green-skinned Lord Piccolo from destroying the world. Piccolo and his henchwoman likewise use all sorts of skulduggery to claim the mcguffins for themselves. There's a fair amount of martial arts, as everybody tries to 1-up everyone else with how good they are. ARE they any good? Well, Chow obviously is, but everything else looks like quick-cut special effects.There's no need for anyone to issue spoiler alerts on this one, because everyone going into it knows exactly how its going to turn out.Frenetic, hackneyed, and preposterous tripe."
Jamie_Seaton,stupid !!!!!!,1/10,17 October 2009,"i watched this film last night and had to turn it off before it finished. the acting was abysmal and the whole story in general was very disappointing. i don't think children will even like this film. Justin Chatwin is a rubbish actor, he has no charisma and never gives a good performance. one thing i will say about this is the fight scenes are pretty OK due to the over the top originality to it. there really isn't anything good going for this overallthis film will easily be forgotten i'm hoping. i am glad other people are with me on this. people need to stop making terrible films like this one.......... 2/10.........j.d Seaton"
jay632,"Oh man, what a terrible movie.",1/10,12 April 2009,"This movie was so awful, i left after 30 minutes. First time i ever walked out of a movie. I came in with low expectations, but, wow, i was just blown away on how terrible this movie is. The acting was awful, chow yuan fat looked foolish and could be his worst acting i've ever seen from him. Every other actor looks like they have never seen the show before because their characters are way off. I know they tried to americanized this movie by changing the settings, but it just didn't work out at all.The effects were OK, but nothing ground breaking and nothing we've not seen before.So in conclusion, please do not watch this movie. The acting is so horrible and its absolutely nothing to do with the anime, except the names. oh man, i was so furious when i walked out...

TheSherm,Childhood Destruction,1/10,20 April 2009,"Simply put this destroyed my childhood. I grew up watching the original Dragonball series on TV. As an avid movie fan I am only slightly more disappointed as a Dragonball fan.The series as a whole is broken down into different segments at different points in Goku's life. Unfortunately, this was not how the film portrayed the series. Rather this film essentially summed up 18 years worth of information into 5 minutes. It brutally cut down on the importance of each character and their relationships. Not only that but it took bits and pieces from other ""segments."" The point at which the movie takes place, the characters should have already known each other and had developed into friends. Also had the movie been longer and better developed the character relationships then it could have been better. The casting of the film could have been better but overall did a good job. They failed in the portrayal of the characters. There were a total of 3 characters that I had real issues with.Master Roshi, played by Chow Yun-Fat, could and should have done so much better. I expected more from someone with so much experience. His role in Bulletproof Monk was a better portrayal of Roshi then in this movie. On top of that Roshi who is supposed to be a lecherous old man and BALD just did not come across well.Goku, Justin Chatwin, who I thought did fairly well in the invisible was slightly disappointing as well. He came off as a teenage kid with angst. He was no different from other kids in high school who are teased and considered ""losers."" Part of Goku's character is where he comes from, which in reality is not discussed until the later series Dragonball Z. However, in the series he grew up with his grandfather Gohan, who mysteriously dies when Goku is ""just a kid."" So Goku really grows up with no interaction with other people and when he meets Bulma for the first times is baffled by the fact that she is missing a tail. In the movie Goku's alter ego, Oozaru, is just a poor excuse for an explanation for what happens to him.Piccolo, James Marsters who I am a huge fan of in series such as Smallville or Angel and Buffy, was slightly disappointing as well. Based on what I saw on IMDb it claims he wanted to adjust the image of piccolo to better portray him. To this end I am over joyed. He took an initiative to better a character who was basically trashed by I'm guessing the writers. Overall the way Piccolo looked was relatively OK, again thanks to Marsters.Other characters such as Bulma and ChiChi were done fairly well. Neither was completely butchered, rather only slightly adjusted. Overall they were portrayed relatively close to what they were supposed to be. ChiChi had been changed to better suit the environment, but later in the movie is revealed to be slightly more along who she was in the Manga/Anime.Finally, dealing with characters there were essentials missing. I was OK not including Puuar or Oolong. But not including Krillin that is just criminal. He is Goku's best friend and one of the longest standing relationships. The longest standing relationship in the series is between that of Goku and Bulma. In the series, Goku meets Piccolo after having met almost all other related characters in the series.As for the movie in terms of cinematic or visual effects, disappointing. I expected more. The Chi/Ki blasts were pathetic. It looked like the tail of a comet or something. It was poorly done. Goku turning into an ape/gorilla. It was painful to watch the transformation. I've seen it done better in movies like Van Hellsing or Harry Potter, granted they were turning into werewolves. There needed to be someway to show off that the characters were more than average in terms of physical skills, with the exception of Bulma who does more than make up for it with intelligence and tech skills. I can't even express how much this movie disappointed me.There was so much potential for this movie. As stated I was a huge fan who grew up watching the series. In fact I own all of the Z and GT series and procuring the original Dragonball series on DVD. The series is such an easy one to do and can relate to so many kids and adults alike. The story line behind the Dragonballs was weak. The character portrayals were outrageous. The overall story and progress mad disappointing. The ending left it open for potential sequels if it had done well. My suggestion is to re-shoot the movie attempting to actually do a good job this time. Follow the story, make it longer then 90 minutes or so. I know it is difficult to keep people in their seats but if you do it right this movie could be amazing. It would keep the fans happy and more then likely allow for a franchise or sequels. Granted there already may be a market for Dragonball products, but it would only serve to help not hinder. There were some funny parts during the movie, but as a whole I was most definitely disappointed."
wahdegreat,Watch it if you have the time...,1/10,16 March 2009,"DB-EVO is again another sad effort by Hollywood to bring the world of comics, manga and games onto the silver screen. In its relentless effort to continuously 'import' ideas from previous works and also literature, DB-EVO is an apparent desperate and not-well thought through attempt. So desperate that this movie appeals to neither the fans of the original Akira Toriyama manga and also to the those that knows nothing about Dragonballs.The maker of the film kept to some of the original story's detail but the story in itself is a total flop. Simplicity may not be the best approach for a manga that relates the adventures of Son Goku from child to adult.Though its plot is fairly easy to predict, audiences are left in total disarray as the movie unfolds. Certain details are not explained and well, simply put ""ends do not meet ends"".After watching for 20 minutes, you can basically tell how the film is going to end. Even the pitiful effort at the end to prelude the ""possibility"" of a second movie is as easily predicted and anticipated as it is poorly done.Throughout the movie, you can see the maker's desperate effort to connect the dots between the characters and the events. Leaving no room for the characters to bond and no time for the events to make sense.The only plus side is the satisfaction that you get when you can tell the character's name before they are told.In summary, if you are a fan of DBZ I would urge you to watch this movie because you will cherish your manga more. For those that are not, watch it if you have the money and time to spare."
klizza287,The Death of Dragonball,2/10,5 April 2009,"When word came out that there was going to be a Dragonball movie, that's exactly what I expected - a live-action version of Dragonball. This movie is far from what I was hoping for and was a huge letdown. The characters were portrayed terribly. I'm not saying the casting was wrong, I'm saying the script was terrible and they were directed in a fashion that didn't suit ANY of their intended personas, Goku's character especially. He was made into an angry kid who wants to fit in and be normal thanks to the teen angst of high schoolers. Did I mention he's in high school? Yup, high school. This tail-less version of Goku meets Chi-Chi who somehow knows how to control ki and fight in tournaments, but can't open a locker. Bulma kind of pops up randomly and decides in a matter of about .4 seconds to go with Goku to get the dragonballs on her transforming motorcycle (it's more than meets the eye!). Piccolo and Mai are best friends. Mai is apparently a combination of Mystique from the X-Men along with a character from The Matrix. Piccolo just looks like a very sick James Marsters in a version of the newest Batman costume who somehow knows how to use the force choke. I'm still upset over the fact that they couldn't at least give him his antennae. Piccolo's offspring look like villains from the Power Rangers and are defeated just as quickly. The only characters that are portrayed even semi-well are Gohan (for the short amount of time he's in it), Master Roshi (to an extent) and Yamcha...While we're still on the subject of characters, can anyone explain why Krillin doesn't exist in DBE at all? Or Emperor Pilaf? Or at least one person from the Red Ribbon Army?Enough about the terrible characters. On to the terrible plot development. The entire movie is rushed. Rushed to the point where it seems like you're really just watching a montage of clips as a synopsis of the movie rather than the movie itself. Everyone seems to just pop-up into the storyline without any real explanation and then go along with whatever's happening at the time.Even if you were unfamiliar with Dragonball and were just seeing it for the fight sequences, you'd be extremely disappointed. There are only about five or so fights, all of which only lasting a couple minutes. The visual effects for the ki blasts aren't too terrible, although they look more like they're made of fire rather than energy.Lastly, everything was extremely scaled down in the movie to where it was almost laughable. Goku's Oozaru looks to be only about 7 feet tall - hardly the menacing and destructive beast he's supposed to be. The Eternal Dragon is also extremely small and looks more like a combination of a lizard and a really tiny version of Falkor.As a Dragonball live-action movie, this work is terrible. The plot and character development are a let down and the action parts are far from action-packed. If you change the title and disassociate it with all things DB, then it could potentially be an okay typical Hollywood teen-drama, but linking it with Dragonball is an embarrassment and an abomination. I recommend waiting until it comes out on television to see it and when you do see it, don't expect too much or you'll be extremely disappointed."
morkulv_athferion,Laughably bad,2/10,8 December 2009,"I was never a fan of the DragonBall (Z) show, despite the fact that I watched the first seasons. But because of all the hype the show gets Hollywood decided that its now time for a live-action DragonBall movie called DragonBall Evolution, which in all honesty is the most unoriginal title I have ever seen.Let me start of right away that even I, someone who is not a fan of the series can see that this movie has very little to do with the show or comics. Transforming bikes? Come on, is that really necessary? Also, for a movie about a show that is known for its large cast of warriors the cast in this movie is surprisingly small. The characters are paper-thin and the actors seem uninspired. Would it kill them to put some more emotion into their roles?One thing that I expected to be at least descent were the special effects, but no, they also suck. The famous 'kamehameha'-attack looks nothing like the one from the show, and the fight-scenes overall look dull. Its sometimes like watching Power Rangers but made by someone who just finished his study of Adobe After Effects. This is like a bad fan-fiction movie that you stumble upon on YouTube.If you are looking for a movie that is true to the source-material its based on, then avoid this movie because apart from a few character-names and a few trivial things it has nothing to do with the show or comics. Just pretend this doesn't exist. This together with Transformers 2 are easily the perfect candidates for worst movies of 2009.Now lets hope they won't make a live-action Naruto-movie..."
pop_pip,A travesty,2/10,10 April 2009,"Dragonball is arguably the best manga/anime ever made. It has an immense amount of popularity that has transcended cultures and become a profitable mainstream commodity worldwide. It has stood the test of time and has been a great inspiration to so many after it.With that said, this movie is a travesty to the product name. The rich characters and carefully crafted story of the manga are carelessly shotgunned onto the screen. The dialog is poor, the acting never gets any better than what we'd find on a mediocre evening kids show, the CG bounces unevenly between barely passable and awful, and most importantly, the fight scenes (and lack of) just plain stink.Dragonball has always been about being epic and larger than life. One glance at the cartoon would demonstrate how they would spend a ridiculous amount of time on building up a fight and then pay it all off with a great one. The manga was always about fantastical ideas, crazy fighting styles, even crazier special moves, and the all important which fighter is stronger debate that was made exponentially better once power levels got involved in DBZ. Simply put, none of this magic was brought over, and too much time is spent on things Dragonball was never known for. Dragonball was never about romance, as it was about family, friendship, and respect.In fact, the Goku/Chi Chi relationship was never emphasized in the comic and always took a back seat to the important matters at hand, like saving the world and working together to accomplish that. The film must have spent like 25% of the time trying to build up this relationship when the manga might have spent 0.1%. I honestly do not believe this kind of lowest common denominator to attract the interest of the female audience was necessary at all. Dragonball never had trouble creating a fan base, so this really feels like one of the many big missteps of the film.In terms of the characters, they really made a mistake in blending the young and old Goku of the original story, which resulted in one that just seems unlikable. Goku was always a bit goofy and was certainly flawed, but he was never a dope like the one we see here. People not familiar with the manga will probably come off with absolutely no idea why Goku is so well adored by all the fans. Next, the ultimate bad boy Piccolo is completely underused with very little screen time. Yamcha is nothing like the one we know, and is made to be a bad comic relief of some sort. Chow Yun Fat's Roshi is close to unwatchable. You cannot blame Chow Yun Fat for trying his best, but he's just a terrible miscast for the role. Fat does the cool stuff well, but this stuff just isn't in his nature, and it shows. Rossum's Bulma actually comes off alright and is probably the best character adaptation out of all of them. She looks great in the role and does pretty much everything you'd expect out of Bulma.Dragonball is the crown jewel of the manga/anime business, which makes it only that much more disappointing that the people involved with this film clearly did not understand what people liked so much about it in the first place. It plays like a B-movie with D-class quality in everything except budget. Fortunately, Dragonball is just too big for even this big tub of junk to cause any long lasting hurt to the franchise."
noloxtreme,Dragonball Disgrace,1/10,20 March 2009,"I agree with the people that say the movie was bad, cause it is, but its watchable.What I liked? I liked the fact that they changed the story a bit, to try to make it plausible, especially in the beginning. We have Goku, going to school, but the job was only half done, its never really realistic. They try to use ancient high school stereotypes, about the classical one-dimensional bully, wanting the cute girl at school. That was even done in smallville and spider-man 1. But there is never really any character development.What else did I like? Eh....Thats it. I think that they should've taken the Batman Begins(I hated Dark Knight by the way) route, by making dragon ball z more plausible. I watched a few seasons of the cartoon, I don't like the fact that it doesn't really fit into any specific genre. They have aliens and space ships, and magic and fantasy, and talking cats in the cartoon, I guess I'm glad they didn't have talking animals in this one, but as I said, they should've grounded the story a little bit more.Unbelievable characters. Bolma, or whoever, has a doctorate in physics and minored in weaponry, while she has a rich daddy? Really stupid premise, makes you really not care about any of the characters.Oozaru or whatever, was only on the screen for a whole minute and didn't add anything whatsoever to the story.Why do they pay people for such horrible work? If you really think about the final fight between Neo and Mr Smith in Revolutions, thats classic Dragon Ball Z, so, apparently this stuff can be done, The Matrix is a movie thats believable, and yet they have cool Dragon Ball Z type of fights, so even if they copied the Matrix or Batman Begins, they would've still created a much better movie.Suggestions. Keep the modern changes, Goku is a hip, high school kid. Take away the guns, decide whether Bulma is Laura Croft or Q from James Bond. Make it relevant. Character development. Cool Matrix fighting scenes. Startrek/Lord of the Ring costumed villains. Voila, Dragon Ball Z you can be proud of."
zardoz-13,"""Prepare To Eat Dirt!""",3/10,13 April 2009,"""Final Destination"" director James Wong juggles more balls than he can manage in ""Dragonball Evolution,"" an uninspired, apocalyptic, martial arts spectacle with Justin Chatwin, Emmy Rossum, Chow Yun-Fat, and Ernie Hudson intended for teenagers. Everything that can go wrong for Wong does in this half-baked, live-action makeover of Akira Toriyama's acclaimed Japanese manga series. Although ""Love and a Bullet"" scenarist Ben Ramsey and Wong treat the material with alarming reverence, this contrived epic amounts to little more than a predictable, paint-by-the-numbers, sci-fi fantasy. Neither the lackluster special effects—including some obvious CGI landscapes--nor the hero's hidden past are memorable bolster this hackneyed yarn. Reportedly, Asian ""Dragonball"" purists, where the film came out a year ago, have been clamoring about the movie's devastating departures from the source material.Indeed, the adolescent fan base that made the original ""Dragonball"" graphic novel series into a stunning sensation with sales of over 150 million volumes in 1984 are more likely to shun this shoddy saga than unsuspecting filmgoers like yours truly. I'll give any movie a shot, but ""Dragonball Evolution"" was a real stinker. Incredibly, Hong Kong ""Kung Fu Hustle"" star/director Stephen Chow produced this PG-rated, hyperbolic hokum in Mexico with 26-year old Justin Chatwin of ""The Invisible"" impersonating a high school student who gets tongue-tied around girls. Talking about masquerades, our hero's alien nemesis, Lord Piccolo, looks like a Halloween goblin who wants to destroy the Earth after having been locked up for 2000 years.Wong and Ramsey pack some pertinent exposition in their pre-titles prologue. They provide a brief montage about a loyal order of monks who imprisoned the diabolical Piccolo (James Marsters of TV's ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") and a sadistic god named Oozaru after an ancient battle. Naturally, nobody remembers this fateful clash of the titans. When the story resumes some 2,000 years later, it takes place on the 18th birthday of Goku (Justin Chatwin) during one of his daily martial-arts training rituals. Goku's aged but aggressive grandfather, Gohan (Randall Duk Kim of ""Memoirs of a Geisha""), never gives the orphan a break as he teaches him kung fu. At Gohan's quasi-ranch-temple-Karate dojo, they leap and lung at each other when they aren't teetering precariously on parallel lengths of tight rope. Gohan imparts wisdom to Goku that sounds suspiciously like something Obi-Wan Kenobi said to Luke Skywalker about the Force.Celebrating Goku's coming-of-age, Gohan gives the lad a glittering orb with four stars. He regales Goku with the history of the heirloom and its supernatural potential. This dragonball can fulfill grandiose wishes when united with six other dragonballs. Goku concerns himself more with his grandfather's advice about quelling the butterflies in his stomach when he tries to talk to girl rather than sparkling spheres. Gohan advises Goku simply to be himself. At high school when the bullies flatten his bike, we secretly want Goku to flatten them with his kung-fu. Our hero refuses to wield his fists of fury against them because Gohan wouldn't approve of such behavior. Meanwhile, Goku has been honing his ability to conjure up energy that enables him to move physical objects through the air. At Unitech High, he proves his ability to conjuring skills when he opens a jammed book locker for his soon-to-be sweetheart, Chi Chi (Jamie Chung of TV's ""Samurai Girl""), and she invites him to her party. About this time, the treacherous Lord Piccolo and his shape-sifting sidekick, Mai (Eriko Tamura of NBC-TV's ""Heroes""), embark on their quest to gather the seven dragonballs, eliminate Gohan, and rule the world. As he lays dying in Goku's arms, Gohan advises his grandson to seek the aid of Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat of ""The Killer"") to help him gather the seven balls before a solar eclipse takes place. ""Dragonball Evolution"" becomes a pilgrimage like ""The Wizard of Oz"" as other oddballs join Goku. While he is fumbling through the rubble of his grandfather's house, Goku comes face-t0-face with a well armed babe, Bulma (Emmy Rossum of ""Poseidon"") toting a big gun. Not only does she possess a Ph.D., but she also has designed a GPS tracking device to locate the dragonballs. Dressed in a black, skin-tight cat-suit, Bulma totes a ""Transformers"" type gadget that fits in the palm of her hand. When she hurls it to the ground, however, it turns into a motorcycle. Picking up Roshi, Bulma and Goku bike off into the desert and promptly crash into a huge pit. The fourth member of this unlikely quartet, Yamcha (Joon Park of ""Speed Racer""), hauls them out of the hole for a piece of the action. Roshi leads our heroes to visit another master, Sifu Norris (Ernie Hudson of ""Ghostbusters"" with white eyebrows), at a Tibetan-style monastery who assures Roshi that his plan to save the Earth has little chance of success.Chow steals the show with his unshaven, Hawaiian-shirt-wearing martial-arts mystic who is obsessed with bikini magazines. As Goku's grandfather, Randall Duk Kim resembles Mr. Miyagi from ""The Karate Kid"" franchise. Again, James Marsters looks like he got shanghaied while knocking on doors at Halloween. Wong and Russell keep our heroic quartet up to their eyeballs in havoc. Chi Chi encounters the shape-shifting Mai who tangles with her long enough in a kung fu tournament to slash her upper arm for a vial of blood so they can have a repeat match in a doppelgänger catfight. Eventually, our heroic entourage has to brave a steaming volcano to collect another dragonball (can we say ""Lord of the Rings"") and Goku waltzes across a lake of burning lava on the corpses of intergalactic werewolves.Typically, audiences are supposed to align themselves vicariously with the hero. The hint that this movie is going to be abysmal occurs in the first quarter hour when our protagonist's martial arts mentor warns him: ""Prepare to eat dirt."" ""Dragonball Evolution"" qualifies as a nothing but dirt."
omgheisretartedlol,Dragoncrap,1/10,25 April 2009,"Hehe.. *chuckle* I don't even know why I am writing this review. Perhaps the movie literally sucks ? Yes, you heard me sucks. Anyone who has seen the original Dragonball Z anime's probably are looking very hopefully to this movie. So did I. I went to the cinema with a few friends with loads of expectations. Didn't care if there were not-known actors. And i swear the first 52 seconds of the movie passed and I said: "" I want my money back"" But i didn't leave hoping of seeing a bit Dragonball ? No- this movie is so utterly crap I think it makes the writers of Dragonball Z cry. Extremely cheesy- acting, plot, story, this movie is 1hour 20min long what the f*ck ? It almost feels like they want this piece of misery as soon as possible. GOD THIS MOVIE IS SO SH*T. You already know what happens near the end. Everything deserves a -50/10. When the credits came I nearly shat myself. I went home sat in the sofa and watched the Original cartoons. Do yourself a favor and do the same.1/10 Abysmal."
mac_martino,Totally and utterly disgrace,1/10,14 April 2009,"To be honest, I did not expect anything from this movie especially after finding out it lasts less than 90 minutes. If you are to expect the story of the original dragonball series, having bulma find Goku at age 10 after the death of his grandpa. You will be astounded, this movie starts with Goku going to Highschool at age 18. Originally Goku never had any studies and had never seen other humans except for his ""grandpa"". More faults in the movie would seem that piccolo sent ouzarou to the earth. Which again is a huge mistake. If any of you expect to have the story told as it should do not go to this movie. I mean, I can understand that they are not able to put the full story into a movie, but I think the early DB series would give enough action to at least start at the beginning. the story about the Redribbon army would have done nicely. So I you are curious wait till the DVD comes out within a quarter of the year the price would be 5 dollars. of euro's whichever country you reside."
dbborroughs,Only worth seeing for a silly Chow Yun Fat,4/10,22 March 2009,"Big budget big screen adaption of the comic and cartoon show is the second live action one to come down the pike. The first version is was Dragonball The Magic Begins and came from Taiwan 20 years ago. In my review I said the best way to enjoy the film was drunk with friends. Things haven't gotten better since then, though the effects are better and the budget is bigger. Caucasian kid (Goku) raised by his Asian grandfather is not allowed to fight because he's too powerful. Piccolo come looking for the Dragonball that the grandfather gave to his grandson he destroys the house and kills the grandfather sending Goku off to find Rosi (Chow Yun Fat and the only reason to see this film) to finish his training and to help him find the 7 balls before the bad guys do. Weak action scenes and the mentality that ""this is a film for 'tweens"" (when it shouldn't have been) makes this a stupid film. Cliché and by rote this film is the sort of thing you could leave for half of it and come back and still know whats going on. Did the filmmakers really have that little trust in their audience? Yup (Then again director James Wong is primarily a writer and producer with only the Final Destination films in the positive part of his directorial resume). Whats worse is that the film isn't so much bad as a complete waste. Its unnecessary in that the only reason it exists is to get a little bit more money from the Dragonball fans (because they are the only one who are going to go) a market that the film won't increase. The only reason to see the film is Chow Yun Fat as Master Rosi. He's very funny and a joy to watch. I can sort of understand why he agreed to do this film since it allowed him to be really wacky, something his other films really haven't allowed him to do. I'd take a pass on theaters and wait for cable, since lord knows it'll end up in heavy rotation there. (What would my review of this film be ala the first versions get drunk comment? How about You know how Western filmmakers mess with Eastern subjects ala Forbidden Kingdom? This is worse.)"
elegantmystery,What the freak,1/10,19 March 2009,Honestly.. I first started watching the movie i was confused?? how old is he whats going on? i watched the series of dragon ball yet was expecting some of this to be different.. this was god awful different. it was random scene after random scene.. i mean they just through characters in left and right things happened so quick my mind almost blew up because i didn't know what was going on.. i would think other people would be mind blown if they hadn't known what was suppose to be happening. i was waiting with great expectation and when i saw this.. it made me wanna vomit. All i kept thinking was.. i could make it better.. and i have no experience at all other than being a viewer.. i hope this gets redone.. for how short this was.. it could have been turned into a long 2.5hour movie with great beginning mid and end.. but god damn my eyes are bleeding.. i don't even know what to say anymore.
joseignacioyootube,The sin convinced Zamasu to end humanity.,1/10,8 May 2023,"What in the world is this blasphemy not against anime or entertainment but to life in general? This is a crime against the people.If you are a fan of the series, STAY AWAY from this disrespect to the original content. This was pretty much made by people knew NOTHING about the anime, let alone the manga. (Ok they knew the names, that's it) and to make things worse, even if we don't care about how embraces Dragon Ball, is still a boring and ridiculous nonsense. Sorry for using too many adjectives but this movie is so forgettable I barely remember anything about it.To summarize, DO NOT WATCH, and not exceptions, I can ensure you, you'll have a better life without watching this attempt of a movie. Lucky I can't give a 0/10, because it absolutely deserves such horrendous rating.

bandhoot,what a disappointed movie!,1/10,17 March 2009,"I have to say: the director shattered most of our DB fans memory if I'd only wish to see some hot scenes, it's also make me down completely, what a shabby CG & effect! that's the worst I've seen this year, didn't 20th FOX lack of money of making that a little shinning? Even if the director don't know how to transfer the story into movie, he would have to make it looks GOOD at least. I have no idea what's the movie about, even the characters named with the names I'm familiar with when I was a Child, even my little brother who came with me to Theater really angry with it ""what a piece of ****"" he said when we came out, we're even glad when we can finally out (actually the movie is quite short 80 minutes seems)I suggest when Hollywood director wish to make Chinese or Japanese story, they need really really think it over before they destroy it, KONGFU Panda is awesome, but DB is awful, that's what I should say, I don't know if Americans like the movie, maybe they look it different way as I am, that's quite normal, cause Oriental people are really have different eyes looking at things, I just assuming, when American director(James Wang,maybe he's not American), try their best to make it looks like Oriental way, it turn out to be it's more quite like American one."
angelocrus,uhmmm... I don't know what's a spoiler,2/10,11 April 2009,"Dragonball was a very entertaining and artistic show; it was one of the first and original animes in the world. The scenes were great and thought-through. The characters were the coolest bunch of characters introduced to the audience. The series was very long but was very exciting and nail-biting, every episode makes you want more cliffhangers were really cliffhangers, no anticlimaxes anticlimaxes were long, even though predictable at times were twisted in such a way you never thought it could happen but they were so good you can't hate it. It goes round and round, around the bushes- along the field, to the trees then back to the bushes but that's what you wanted, you do not want the series to end in such short and hurried scenes/plot.The distinct personalities of the characters, the way they were presented in the series were seriously and squintedly splattered. Each character had his/her own idiosyncrasy; viewers chose the characters that mostly infected them- go along with the story, make their own scenes and stories inside their own heads and fantasize themselves over the morals the show taught them.It was about friendship, brotherly love mostly although there were some adolescent-stuff, fun and really funny, corny but what do you expect?- still was cool, family love, ambition, greed, 'the bad never wins' or fairy tale and heroism etc, etc. The connection between viewers and the imageries were so strong, like in sports, the dads scream at the TV, win with the players and lose with them. Its what its all about, if the show touches the heart and mind and the kid inside the heart of audiences, Dragonball anime did.Goku was the ultimate hero, he was strong, ultramale machismo looks but was kind and soft to those he loved, sacrifices all he'd had for those around him- even those he didn't know, saved the world with his life, died for Earth- but he somehow went back to Earth many times as an angel, etc, died for humans- even if he wasn't human I mean to say, he was The HERO, that's it. I myself liked to go around the bush just like the series.The sub-characters were all the same, they were heroes wanting to save Earth from bad aliens and the likes. The comedy incorporated within the show was effective, the drama more effective, the action even more designed artistically. Things happened the way you wanted it to be, the way you expected but when it happened you wanted the other thing to have happened, it should have but it didn't but you were so cool with what really happened. (Going around the bush).What do I say? The cartons were so great The movie? Talents were such a waste, the title didn't live up to its original form, the story and plots were so not cool, the action effects even fancy were not original and short, I felt stew-peed just by watching the movie, teenage-stuff? totally uncool, the geek-turned-to-be-Hero stuff totally too used, almost every aspect of the movie was not patterned to its original source- the cartoons series, everything was confusing (the two Chi-chi scene was not- I already know the orig Chi-chi would be the one kayoed by Goku), Evolution really?- evolved to a mess and crap maybe?, not a good script- there were scenes I wanted to happen but it didn't, I felt like the drama stuff were HAVE-TO's scenes- I felt like the actors do not know what they were doing except for some--- in total- the movie was DISAPPOINTING.I liked Bulma (beautiful and dexterous) but she was so different with what I knew as Bulma in the cartoons, she was much younger. Bushen (funny and warm) was portrayed well. But Goku didn't look like Goku- he was a teenager kid geek stutterer whatever not good looking (as my standards for the character Goku, but the actor was handsome or cute, I have nothing against him); Piccolo was handsome- he was supposed to be only good-looking to Nemics; grampa was good (but the connection between him and Goku failed, the story was so rushed and short); Yamcha- what the heck? (he was supposed to be good-looking and charming with an X-mark on his face). It was so confusing and unappreciating, was this one of them who was only made for M? Even the music was not good; it was irritating (sometimes silence is better than too much noise to make it look like more painful or frightening). Mouths opening without words, three-second or more pauses during conversations but was really not necessary or the follow-up answer should have been uttered faster. The story was, again, rushed they could have made a three-hour movie and I would still like it as long as there are good pauses, good conversations, good Grampa-Goku bonding, good character introduction, less gun-pointing-and-talking-and-not-shooting-until-the-target-goes-away scenes, more fancy places like Mars or Nemic- just make it longer and make it necessary, less mean-girls or at this movie mean-jocks scenes (too overused and senseless and Absolutely irritating), the princess kissing the frog was cool- before but not in Dragonball.The fight scene between Piccolo and Goku was amazingly too not-entertaining and almost ugly it made me appreciate more the cartoons.All in all, Dragonball Cartoons' score is nine, this movie fared well at two for good-looking actors and low-budget, low intellectual story and plot. It was so stew-peed I regretted watching this movie. Sorry."
scallahan7,This Movie Sucked... Really Bad,3/10,22 March 2009,"The beginning looked relatively promising, but i wasn't too impressed. I was thinking that it would just improve as the movie went on, but I was wrong, very wrong.First off, I didn't like the modern setting. Why couldn't they stick to the original show? I honestly think they should just remake this movie. There were no awesome powers or crazy fight scenes. The villains also sucked. The dialog was very poorly written as well.From the start, you have very unlikeable characters. Almost everyone was very poorly cast. I thought Goku and Master Roshi were fine, but Bulma was absolutely terrible. I hated her and really wanted her to die.The ending made me very angry also. I was hoping that there would be some epic fight, but again, I was very disappointed. After this ""fight"" was over, I was left scratching my head in disbelief.Terrible dialog, awfully cast characters, and a pathetic journey and ending should have made Dragonball Evolution a straight to DVD release.And flying Hummers? Common... 3/10"
sarm123,Awful,1/10,24 August 2014,"As a kid I watched the cartoon Dragon Ball. Since it was a long time ago, I do not remember all the details. I only knew that it was a boy Goku has a tail that looks like Schwarzenegger in his best days and is searching for the dragon balls. In the movie Goku is the skinny young man (we have already seen that the movie will be bad, because the choice of lead actor was desperate), which has two problems. The first is that it bullied at school, what else is in love with the girlfriend of a guy who mistreats him. The story we've all seen a hundred times. Further course of action can be assumed. It easily beat the bullies, becomes charmer, and gets the girl. Yet finds out that his grandfather killed Piccolo. Then he tries to destroy Piccolo and save the world. The film is full of clichés, stupid dialogue and bad special effects. If something is supposed to be good in this film these are special effects. If you are a fan of Dragon Ball serial skip this movie, because it will not disappoint you. If you've never watched Dragon Ball skip as you will save 80 minutes. In any case, skip this movie.

matt-setiawan,"I didn't expect it to be good, but I didn't expect it to be that bad either.",2/10,10 April 2009,"I knew all along that this movie was vaguely based on the actual story of Dragonball. The reason why I went to go see it was to laugh at it. The feeling I had going in was, ""Oh man! They made a movie out of an anime with flying people who shoots beams and fight really really fast!? I must see it just to laugh at its cheesiness"" yet... It was hard to even laugh at it cause it was just generally bad. There are a few quotes and some visual effects that I found really funny, but they lasted only a few seconds and that is all. It was just so bad that it was hard to make fun of it, or laugh at any of its parts. If anyone wants to watch it, rent it, it is not worth the price of watching it in theaters..... What am I talking about, just don't watch it. Seriously, if someone watches this in the theaters, it's equivalent to giving a homeless person some money and watching him/her go buy alcohol.

OrdinaryPerson69,The worst movie I've ever seen,1/10,9 April 2023,"The only good part of this movie is when Goku said ""it's Goking time"" and just absolutely goked Piccolo. Holy cow, I still have massive chills from that. That here, is truly one of the scenes in cinematic history.In all seriousness, the movie's terrible. I do NOT recommend this.This is unfaithful to the excellent source material, the character designs are inaccurate and looked awful. Despite being a 30 million dollar budget film, the costumes and well, the visuals as a whole, look absolutely terrible.And don't get me started on the abilities.Example: AIR BENDING?!?! I'm sorry, is this Dragon Ball or The Last Airbender?!?!With all that said, avoid this movie at ALL COSTS.If you've seen this movie, I am so sorry and I hope you recover from the atrocity you have just witnessed."
atiq761,Worst film of the year,3/10,21 March 2009,"I'm not going to waste anymore time to write a long, full review of this movie after already wasting 90 min. of my valuable time. In one line I can say- this movie sucks. Everything in this movie is bad. The entire cast was wrong, acting was poor and visual effects totally unconvincing. The story was very shallow and failed to leave any impression. At one point, I started laughing by seeing a black man acting as a buddhist monk in a remote mountain. In the end, I left the theatre aghast with myself and admonishing myself for making a such a poor choice. If you guys really want to know what a real bad film is, then you should watch this movie otherwise not.

Twisted_Nocker,Biggest disappointment of he last 10 years.,1/10,11 April 2009,"I have been a Dragon Ball/ Dragon Ball Z fan since I was in the 7th grade, I am 22 now. The idea of a live action dragon ball movie never seemed like it could happen until I saw the last ""Matrix"" movie. The fight between Smith and Neo was the tip of what I would imagine a Dragon Ball movie to be, and I began to hope. I went to the movie without watching a single preview because I didn't want any chance for a spoiler and I went in with the idea that the plot would be changed a bit and they had to change how some of the characters look just because of how they were drawn (goku's hair cant be done easily in real life). That being said... This movie could not have been farther from a Dragon Ball/ Dragon Ball Z plot. The characters were all wrong and some of the most important characters were either left out (Krilin) or changed into a different person (Yamcha). The identity of Goku was totally changed, making it impossible to bring a vast majority of other characters into the storyline in case of a sequel (Lets hope they don't). They took what could have been a great martial arts fantasy with some humor in it and turned it into high school drama mixed with unbelievably bad special effect and next to no fighting. The only thing in this movie that was true to the cartoon was how the dragon balls looked, THEY EVEN CHANGED THE DRAGON! All I can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of the cartoon, stay far far away, you will only become angry. If you haven't seen the cartoon and the idea just seems cool, stay away anyways because the acting and special effects are nothing like they could or should have been. 1/10 without a second thought. With any luck, we can hope that a couple years from now it gets remade like what happened with ""Hulk"" and we can enjoy ourselves."
renojms,"Crap, crap.... and... C-R-A-P",1/10,13 April 2009,"I love Dragonball - it's original series, DBZ, DBGT and all the animated movies which go with it all. One day, I decided that upon impulse, I would buy the first five or six seasons plus the three-disc saga of Goku, the Broly movies, History of Trunks, Bardock, World's Strongest and... I think... one other. Well, I'd never seen a single Dragonball anything before that other than a few drawings and people saying how great it was. My impulse didn't disappoint me. I grew so addicted to them, and now I'm waiting for DBZ season 9. Finished GT with a feeling that I want more Dragonball cartoons to be made - rebirth the series, etc. with the new generation characters. So, my personal history out of the way, hind-sight is 20/20, and I know lots of you out there have heard that phrase before. Well, it's ESPECIALLY true with DBE. Even though you know it's going to suck, you still drive your inner-being to pay the money to go see it. The minute I saw the previews I knew it was going to be horrible. Matter of fact, the minute I heard that a live Dragonball movie was going to be made, I knew it was going to suck. That ain't the half of it.Here's a little comparison: DB: Master Roshi, a perverted old man - funny as hell, lives in a small house called the Kame House on a small tropical island with a sea turtle.DBE: Master Roshi, a semi-perverted middle-aged man - trying to be funny as hell, living in a small tenement on a dreary island which sits over a pit of dirt in the middle of a city. It has no name, he has no sea turtle.DB: Mai - one of Emperor Pilaf's dunce henchpeople(woman), who - though their efforts to stop Goku are made, always fail with funny results. She is accompanied by a Dog-like soldier of equal stupidity named Shu (I believe).DBE: Mai decided to tell Emperor Pilaf (who isn't mentioned in the movie at all) to f*ck off so she could run away with someone who looks like a cross between a Vulcan, a Vampire, and a cucumber. Oh, that would be Piccolo, by the way. There is no dog named Shu (she probably decided to eat him for dinner). Mai is a ruthless, sincere (though always failing) henchwoman for Piccolo. There is no dunce-like properties as there is in the series. She just fails.DB: Ozaru is Goku's Saiyan form while he has his tail. This is brought on by the rays of the full moon. Goku was sent to the earth to destroy it, but when dropped on his head, Goku forgets his initial programming and becomes innocent. Ozaru is a gigantic human-ape with the size larger than King Kong.DBE: Ozaru is a slave of sorts to Piccolo. Forget the Saiyan race, and forget the fact that Goku should be a child with a tail. He has no tail, and the only thing which could have now come from dropping him on his head, is it might make his acting better. Ozaru is not gigantic. He is just... well... stupid.DB: Pilaf, Shu, General Red, Red Ribbon Army, Baba...DBE: None of the above.DB: Krillin, Chiaotzu, Tien, Puoi (spelled right?)DBE: Nope.DB: Bulma - a dorky, too-lady-like, chickensh*t inventor daughter of the capsule corporation, blue hair.DBE: Bulma - Gun-toting bad-ass with no lady-like qualities, too brave for her own good, still an inventor, but no blue hair - just blue streaks.DB: Oolong.DBE: who?DB: Yamcha - desert bandit who crushes on Bulma, yet is too scared to talk to her - or any woman for that matter.DBE: Yamcha - desert bandit who has the hots for Bulma, and is too confident for his own good.Yeah, well, I'll just save any more comparisons, but you get the idea. This movie under another title, nor in any generations to come, will ever be any good. Oh, and the Kamehameha Wave, is properly pronounced (Kah-may-uh-may-uh), not (Kah-may-hah-may-ha) as is done in the movie. The only time the latter pronunciation is used, is when Goku yells it as he executes the attack."
hoteteu_n,abysmal,2/10,30 April 2009,"i don't really know with what to start the comment... first, Son Goku it's not at all the Sayan you know from the anime. if you don't see or heard about Dragon Ball, you will find that Son Goku from the movie (interpreted by Justin Chatwin in a stupid way, i don't want to say more about him, he tries to be a great actor, but he isn't ... sorry about the truth) it's a teenager who will save the world in 1 hour and 20 min. the action it's happening to quickly, the fighting scenes are awful in slow motion, some are good but only few of them, in fact only one : the final battle which ends in a couple of minutes. and if don't know the legend from the world's best anime... well, you will not understand much from this movie. the actors are bad, there is no scene well done, but i found it curiously entertaining. i watch the anime movies of Dragon ball Z, nothing compared with this imbecility... and wait, there will be another Dragon ball, but really we all hope they will make a great sequel. in conclusion, where the f... goes the budget of 100 millions $ ????? !!! try anything done by Uwe Boll, it's 10 times better... the surprise: it's not voted to be THE WORST movie ???"
Harry_Erickson,"Dragonball, No Destiny to the Box Office",2/10,14 March 2009,"Want to watch a heart pounding, well plotted, action filled, well casted film then call up your local Movie Phone & arrange to see Transporter 3, if you want a boring, terribly plotted, badly casted, actionless film then call your local Movie Phone and arrange to Dragonball Evolution.The Story is of Goku (Justin Chatwin) trying to collect the seven dragonballs to wish away the Evil King Piccolo (James Marsters), so with the help of Bulma (Emma Rossum), Gokus love interest Chi Chi (Jamie Chung), Gokus mentor Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yamcha (Joon Park)The story is terribly written as the original story was to find the 7 dragonballs in one week to stop Piccolo because its the only way to stop him but halfway through the film the balls are stolen and guess what, all along there was an alternative!!!! The collection of the balls seemed to be a waste of times and it seems that wherever a Dragonball was, they just happened to be 5 feet away!!! The casting itself is quite odd as it is a mixture of Japanese and American actors that doesn't work with the fact that it is supposedly meant to be all Japanese. Justin Chatwin was the only good choice as a character, he seemed to bring drama to the character and the film.James Marsters acting is very boring and unbelievable, he looks more like an old potato that's gone green then a scary looking villain and he has a boring voice, Emma Rossums character is fairly well played as it is obvious that she studied for the role however she doesn't look the role and halfway through the film becomes a lot weaker as she starts out a tough character. The Character of Yamcha is very annoying as he isn't a good face or a good actor, the reason he stays with Goku is to get a percentage of Bulmas new invention which really doesn't make sense. Jamie Chung seems to be a good actress and does fairly well in the film however doesn't suit to be Justin Chatwins girlfriend.The action in this film was poorly choreographed, it was 1 minute of trading kicks and punches and then some kind of magic blast, the disappointing fighting is shown at the end of the film when Justin Chatwin kills James Marsters with one little magic blast, it was a disappointing fight as it was built up all film and then only lasted 1 minute.In total the film was a big disappointment to all Dragonball fans around the world, it seems to be just American entertainment trying to westernise a Japanese classic.Most disappointing is the work of Chinese Producer Stephen Chow who has directed many Chinese films that have unlike other Chinese films made it to the attention of the Western world (Must See), Shoalin Soccer & CJ7. A disappointing film but is worth seeing it for the hell of it."
sullivares,Just let the Japanese make the live action Anime,1/10,30 June 2015,"If there's lower than 1 rating i would give it to this flop movie. This movie ruined the Dragonball name. Every details of movie is so F@#$ed up. Hollywood please... please...please... Don't ever try to make movies about anime ever again. We anime lovers don't like changing the stories, from Manga to anime to live action movie. We want to see how will it evolved from paper to real. And not messing the whole story and changed it to your own.Even the costumes of the characters are so messed up. Hollywood just stick messing with Dc and marvel movies.. Don't touch anime ever again. So ill give a 1 vote out of 10. So awful that after seeing it i puke.

aaronmocksing1987,Kame-Hame-Huh?... What?,1/10,9 September 2010,"As a young kid I grew up and always had a fond recollection of the DragonBall series. The first one ranks amongst the best of the trilogy; the second one was all about steroids and screaming matches for ten minutes until they had no room, and the third one tried to combine most... but by then it was over. But the first one, a retelling with some twists on the legendary Monkey King story eons ago, was amongst the most memorable.You had a charming little tale of a young boy, lost in the road of life and blissfully unaware of what the city, the world, had to offer him. Joining a spunky intelligent lass on a quest to collect the seven DragonBalls. Seven grant a wish, but this path would not be easy: midget demons were after it, an entire army of soldiers with dark intentions were after it, not to mention desert thieves and bandits. To the common stranger, you might as well have called this somewhat of thinly veiled Superman story, or simply taking a classic legend into something funny, witty, and wise.This piece of sh.t is an abomination. If the early photo designs of a dude in an Ambercrombie and Fitch t-shirt with a strangely chiseled jawline and rubbery Goku plastic hair did not phase you, then now you will ultimately learn your mistake in judgment, my friend.From the very moment I booted this up, nothing seemed to bother me. Why is Goku not Asian? I shrugged it off, and was kind there. They screwed this up in two other adaptations, but I figured, 'Well, it's not like I watch this show anymore, so...' Then I questioned the absence of Roshi's beard and sunglasses, his crave of porn. This too was absent. Where was Yamcha's mane? Why is Bulma ugly? All of these were simple marks I passed off, thinking, 'Well, it's not like Hollywood gets anything right anymore... they see something beautiful and take a dump on it.' Then I saw one pivotal plot point, and then I was done.I was done.I could not see this movie any more.For anyone who should have seen DragonBall in some form or another - and you should have, it's been on for a century now in constant movie re releases - then you should know Son Goku. Goku is a masculine Hulk Hogan character who, stupid as he is, knows how to rearrange people's faces physically while being a gentle soul.So forgive me when I ask, why is he being picked on by black people at thirty minutes into the movie and acting like an emotional, suicidal teenager? Can someone point me into the idiot who added that into the script? Why is he going to school with that haircut? With that kind of confused, poor attempt at a James Dean face, I'd beat the hell out of him too.At that point, I took my rental and snapped the disc in two. It does not deserve to live. Nor does it need a sequel, or games.This is when we allow 2nd graders borrow the 'Superman' script by Richard Donner for reviews and editing."
baseballrunner76,This is cinematic filth of the highest degree.,1/10,26 March 2009,"My childhood is ruined. I have witnessed the death of a beloved franchise millions have come to adore and respect. This movie is not an adaptation, nor is it an homage of any sort. It is a mockery. A sheer insult to all those whom cherish Dragonball deep within their hearts and souls.Why does this video-tape recording (I absolutely refuse to deem it 'film' status) fail to such a devastating degree? It does not capture any of the charm, wit, excitement, humor, or bad-assery to be found in its source material. James Wong has simply taken the title, characters, and... errm, hairstyles, and has furtively stapled them to the bloody forehead of a poorly scripted, heavily underdeveloped movie about collecting seven golden balls that when gathered, will summon a flying dragon who will grant you one magical wish! How fantastically whimsical!Who cares.There is nothing compelling about this film. It's painstakingly difficult to care about any character in this film, and that goes for Goku as well. Right from the get-go, you bare witness to a horribly underwhelming fight session between Goku and his Asian(?) grandfather Gohan, who carries a bizarrely flawless American accent.. go figure. The reason I imply confusion behind Gohan's Asian ethnicity is that his grandson Goku is, well... nevermind. It isn't even worth getting into; the casting for this movie made no sense. No consistency whatsoever. Disgusting.The dialogue is cheesy and executed improperly in every way conceivable. You want cheesy dialogue done right? Go watch the Wachowski brothers' Speed Racer released last year, truly a masterpiece as far as anime adaptations are concerned. What is improper about it, you inquire? It causes you to cringe without the ability to hold back. Every single word muttered is a bleak reflection on each actor's terrific inability to act in any way, shape or form.Speaking of form.. Don't even expect half a thrill from this movie's excuse for action sequences. These actors cannot fight under any set of circumstances. The wirework is so blatant and poorly imposed that I swear to have caught eye of a couple unedited out wires left in some of the more acrobatic scenes.Really? Come on, Hollywood. Come on, Fox.These sort of mistakes became a thing of the past DECADES prior. If a movie based on the almighty Dragonball franchise is going to suck this severely OUTSIDE of the fight sequences, at LEAST refine those few scenes (Dragonball's saving graces, so to speak) into something worthy of admission price. Get a couple professional choreographers on the set to help out, if you don't mind. (what a strange and unusual concept, huh!?) I've said it before and I'll say it again; if this entire project had been up to the legendary Stephen Chow, we could have had a sheer masterpiece on our hands. (refer to Kung Fu Hustle, what I believe to be the most faithfully Dragonballesque live action movie ever made) I shall continue no further. This movie does not deserve any longer of a review. In fact, slice this eloquently written verdict in half and it would still be far too flattering in length.I feel that if FOX wishes to maintain any credibility they have left with their audiences, they will hold back on dumping this atrocious landfill upon the United States' precious array of cinemas. Of course, we know this is not realistic.It's nice to dream."
bongoqueenblue,Where's the Dragonball Movie?,1/10,14 April 2009,"Dragonball Evolution was the kind of movie a theater should pay someone five bucks to see and tell them that it sucks. The only way to improve the film would be to start from scratch and have whatever pre-teen schoolgirl that wrote that god awful story take a look at either the original manga or television series.I had hopes for it. Dragonball was the catalyst series that got me into drawing and wanting to make cartoons. This movie crushed me. I cannot believe ANYONE thought this was a good idea. Everything about this movie is just so incredibly horrible its unbelievable! The acting-Bad. The story-Bad. The special effects-BAD! Nothing about this movie was good or original. It's like star wars, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Lord of the Rings, and a cheap made for TV special all melded together to create a half hour of disappointment, agony and the destruction of childhood memories.Don't pay to see this. In fact, don't see it all because you will be crushed and angry. Remember how Southpark portrayed Lucas and Spielberg after the last Indianna Jones movie? Even comedy Central wouldn't let them air what Fox did to Goku. It's just BAD.And those of you that like this movie, or even think it's okay...don't even. Encouraging this film is like spitting in Toriyam's face."
delusions_of_greed,Kamehame... superman?,1/10,1 April 2009,"---SPOILERS--- but its a must read. for fans and new comers. you may regret not reading this. ---SPOILERS---I'm choosing not to rate this movie because not only was it God awful, but it somewhat insulted my intelligence. ESPECIALLY from a fans perspective. I brought a friend to watch the movie who has never watched the cartoon/ read the books to get a different view. and he had the very same reactions towards the movie. From his perspective, the movie was sloppy, the way they explained everything in the movie was very vague and unbelievably confusing. Who's piccolo, why does he want to take over the world? Whats the point of him getting the dragonballs? and whats the connection between goku and the dragonballs (this even confused me) the movie had absolutely no value or point to it, just mindless fighting and senseless conversations. I know people who think this movie is actually good are going to complain to the fans that akira allowed it. Yes, akira allowed the PRODUCTION of the movie, it doesn't mean he allowed them to murder and butcher the TRUE storyline of Dragonball. People are also saying ""Well... what do you want? they tried to turn the entire piccolo saga into one movie"" Well, they did a really bad job doing it. If they were to do this, they should have followed the original storyline A LOT better. I can easily get over how the characters look in the movie (they're just adapting to modern day no big deal), but the way they portrayed their characters were horrible. To a fan, you can tell they're trying to act like the characters from the anime, but you can also tell that they failed miserably. But from the perspective of a new comer, it looks like terrible acting. As the fans are aware, goku's main technique is the Kamehameha... the fan should also be aware that the kamehameha is done standing still and Goku has NEVER done it while flying. Lets just say the movie made him look like a blue superman when he does the kamehameha. The main characters were introduced into the movie TERRIBLY. The fans are also aware how Grandpa Gohan died... well, thats not how he dies in the movie.plain and simple. if you're a fan, watch it so you know what they've done to one of the greatest childhood shows. and if you're a new comer... you were warned. this movie is a waste of money and time unless you're sneaking into the movie."
sadik35,Dragon Ball Evolution Review,2/10,8 April 2009,"For many years not, the cult phenomenon Dragon Ball Z has been praised and fans have been dying for an effective and superb adaptation of the series. However, Hollywood made a smart decision in an attempt to begin the saga, Dragon Ball from the very start. 'Z' was to acknowledge a change in the series as we see the characters had matured. Now to the matter at hand. Dragon Ball Evolution is not a faithful adaption, neither is it a good one. So to make points seem fair to fans and non-fans alike I'll apply a 'For And Against Argument'. Topic: Is Dragon Ball evolution a good movie? To answer that I would say no because I am a fan of the series but I am open minded and decided justify the movie as a whole, fan based and on its own merits.For/ It is a good Movie .The special effects were not half bad .Ki attacks, while not looking like what fans hoped for was okay at bestAgainst/ Dragon Ball Evolution is a horrendous movie . Characters are not similar to the ones we have loved for so any years. . Characters such as Krillin, Kami and a few are missing . Goku Going to high school is a big deal as it destroys the entire character that is Goku along with other elements presented in this movie .The entire story is just plain dumb . Absence of character development . Action is toned and thus lack of excitement .Ki attacks, especially kamehameha blast is obnoxious to look at .Plain simple, fans are gonna hate it and I'm betting so is everyone else"
korydero,HOW???,1/10,2 September 2018,"I have been WAITING for this app to let me write a review, it FINALLY is allowing me to do it. I have always love dragon ball, DBZ and GT. Super is out and that's great as well. Akira Toriyama's mind is amazing for what he has done. If anyone thought this movie was his doing, they would be naive and haven't truly seen the series. This is an atrocity to all that is Dragon Ball. Acting is mediocre at best, the script sounds like it came from a 10 year olds dream when they try to make it cooler than it actually is. No one in this movie even resembled any of the characters from the series (Even though they FORCED it with Goku's hair) except for Yamcha, that's EXTREMELY agruable. HOW did James Wong even get the approval for this movie??? All in all, this was a sad excuse for Dragon Ball.

Darth_Revan-83,"This is not an ""Evolution""...",2/10,14 April 2009,"I don't often regret seeing movies. I've watched all of Uwe Boll's movies, and... God forgive me... I liked some of them. On the other hand, I've regretted seeing some after-school specials on TV, when I could have been doing some homework, or cleaning my room, or stuff like that. But never has there been such a severe rape of my childhood memories that I actually had to ask for my money back at the cinema.So, here we are... where do I even begin? Well... let's begin with the running time. Eighty (80) minutes. I thought websites were posting these numbers wrong when I first saw them, but... they weren't. Eighty minutes in which they have to develop a plethora of characters, and shove a story that goes nowhere fast down our throats.Let me make a personal statement to the guys over at 20th Century. Eighty minutes is NOT FEATURE-LENGTH!! I've seen Cartoon Network shows that air for more then that. Let this phrase set the tone for the rest of my review...OK so we have Goku, Bulma, Roshi, Piccolo, Mai, Chi-Chi and Yamcha... so... where's Krillin? Let's not regret his loss though, he would have just hogged more of the very scarce screen time.Goku's character is averagely-written. There are some good scenes with him. Some average scenes... but most are just downright bad. I don't remember him using the Force to open up lockers in his HIGHSCHOOL, do you? I don't remember him fighting bullies from his HIGHSCHOOL, do you? I also think it sort of strange that American high-schoolers just HAPPEN to have katanas. Moving along... Goku's personality doesn't really evolve throughout the movie, he doesn't learn anything worthwhile by the end, and he's sometimes just painful to watch. Justin Chatwin's wretched acting doesn't do Goku justice either. *Emotion*, *Emotion*...Bulma is possibly the best developed character, and she also gets a reasonable amount of screen time, although she doesn't need half of it. She also ""misteriously"" falls in love with Yamcha for no particular reason, other than his mere presence. From the MOVIE'S perspective, Bulma and Goku would of made a better pair than Bulma and Yamcha. But obviously if they had done that, we would of crucified the producers.Master Roshi. He's there. Next character.Yamcha. He's also there. Next character.Chi-Chi & Mai. I don't regret saying this: they were not necessary. The ENTIRE film could of been done without these two characters. They had little, if any relevance to the story, and they were horribly underdeveloped.They were also out of place sometimes. Scrapping these two characters could have saved a lot of much needed screen time.Piccolo. James Masters. Now, I am not personally familiar with any of Mr. Masters' work, but his performance in this movie was way above what the other actors managed to accomplish. The only problem being... he gets less screen time than Mai. I don't need to say more... Okay one more thing: they forgot about him completely at the end of the movie. Nobody told us if he died, or if he survived. Nothing. He just falls down, and that's it. Not to mention the fact that nobody ever explains how he was set free in the first place.Grandpa Gohan. He also appears, and is portrayed surprisingly well, but is killed off by Piccolo's Force Grip technique about 10 minutes into the movie. Remember that from the anime?So that's about it for the characters. I should begin to comment on the actual movie now, but... I think people would have gotten the general idea by now. Underdeveloped characters, pointless plot strings, very short runtime, and some of the WORST acting (except James Masters and Randall Duk Kim) and dialog I've seen for a very long time. Uwe Boll is a poet compared to some of the stuff written here.I wish I could have given this movie more than 2/10. I really did. But it shattered all my childhood concepts of Dragonball, and I can't let it get away with that. Even if it wasn't called ""Dragonball"", and the characters were all named differently, it would still be one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen.A longer runtime, i.e. 150 min, would of allowed for more character developing and plot advancement. Removing unnecessary characters would have also allowed for stronger relationships between the viewer and the main cast. But I digress... the damage is done.(P.s. the two ""Force"" references I used in this review are obviously intended to be parodies, and not the actual Ki energy used.)"
aleclemlij,Fail. Go with forbidden kingdom instead...,2/10,7 May 2009,"as many other reviewers, I grew up watching DB. Between some good action series (dark angel) and action movies (Fantasic Four) I thought Fox was going to do a good tribute. But no. This movie was terrible. Plot was changed deliberately it had almost nothing to do with the original saga. Fight scenes were good but minor and other than one or two cheap ""After Effects"" power blasts (won't reduce myself to call those abominations kamehameha or mafuba) the movie failed to impress me. Not only they disprespected us old-school fans, but also a great and very known Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki, who composed a song SPECIALLY for Toriyama and the movie. And guess what? Fox didn't use it!! Well they did, but only in stupid credits that song was fantastic for an action scene. What a joke!! If you want to see a good ""live action version"" of Dragon Ball, go with ""Forbidden Kingdom"" (Jackie Chan and Jet Li). Not really based on Dragon ball but on Monkey King (DB too so they have some similarity) This movie just doesn't worth it. Except three hot chicks and a fantastic (altough terribly misused)song by Ayu, there is nothing I can save nor recommend about this movie. Are you a DB fan? You can avoid this. I give it two stars instead of 1 because granted, its still way better than the one china did in 1991. But don't get fooled: both movies suck anyways."
Scatterpulse,We Wish We Were Transformers: The Movie!,2/10,6 May 2009,"I'll keep this brief.Those who aren't familiar with the Dragonball mythos will most likely be confused by this film. Despite the many changes that the creators of this movie made to the narrative, it relies heavily upon an assumed pre-existing knowledge of the franchise on the part of the viewer.Those who ARE familiar with the Dragonball franchise will get to experience the joy and warmth of a cherished childhood narrative being simultaneously raped and defecated upon. Case in point: the creators were obviously trying to cash in on the success of Transformers through Goku's remodeling as an angsty high school student who also happens to be sooper speshul (not a theme exclusive to Transformers, obviously, but the plagiarism is hard to ignore here). He's a horny, frustrated, manipulative young man who cares more about getting a kiss from a girl he barely knows than saving the world (this is illustrated quite literally during his attempt to master the kamehameha technique).I'm only a casual fan of the original series, but oh ye gods this is a terrible movie."
Inimicusmalus,Cookie cutters are less predictable,1/10,14 April 2009,"Alright seriously now, how did this movie even make it to large scale theater release is there no quality control in Hollywood? I'm going to begin with a quick summary of the things wrong with this movie to help set the tone. Easily Predictable dialog and plot, cookie cutter archetypal characters, bland special effects, and an overly compressed plot. With that said I'm going to expand here: From the start of the movie I could tell you exactly what was going to happen without having read any of the Dragon Ball Manga, watched any of the Dragon Ball Anime, or having anything to do outside a very basic knowledge of the thing to begin with, the plot was like something a mediocre middle school child would write for (un)creative writing class. The setup of the movie was confusing; supposedly taking place in Japan it seems funny that except for Chichi, Roshi, Yamcha, and to an extent Gohan and Mai no one was even vaguely Japanese. Bulma was played by Emmy Rossum, possibly the most western looking actress out there today and the man who played Goku wouldn't look out of place in the rural united states. The bullies who try and beat him up were obviously taken from a high school near where the director lived and everyone else they meet seems drawn from the western world. As I said the plot followed a predictable dialog: Grandfather dies before he can tell a great secret to his grandson, grandson decides to seek vengeance using the powers taught to him by poor departed grandpa, meets people who inexplicably want the exact same thing for no real good reason other than Deus ex Machina, and finds that the secret to beating his grandfathers killer is the old reinforcing words he used to always tell him...aww how sweet. What is even more confusing in the plot is the time line: Two weeks are supposed to pass before the end, not a very long time at all, yet somehow he manages to Master the most secret powers of martial arts when at the start of the two weeks he hadn't even mastered the first level. The love story had no place in here, it was forced, stupid, and so barely mentioned yet so important that it left one dumbfounded as to why they wasted the movie reel for those portions. The Characters and their histories are cookie cutter at best and as predictable as the plot line, to make it worse the actors portraying them put forth a lamentably shallow performance and it was blatantly obvious that they were actors who had not the least idea how to portray these horrid two dimensional characters. Goku is the loner who in truth just wants to be loved and accepted and, wow fancy that, he is also immensely powerful but impatient and hot tempered. He secretly longs for the ""hot girl"" in school who seems so far out of his reach. If he used his strength he could likely get her but a promise he made to his grandfather for some reason stops him despite the fact that he is a teenage boy (guess the director doesn't have kids). Further he is portrayed as at least of average intellect yet some of the things he fails to grasp until later in the movie are so obvious that one of limited intellect would grasp them (For Example: Don't fight when he doesn't have to fight to win as he demonstrates in the movie). Bulma is the rich girl scientist bombshell who for some reason knows more about weaponry and fighting than some people in law enforcement do. For someone working in a lab on energy sources she is perfectly adept at using weaponry and a variety of high tech gadgets. She meets the main character at the point of a pistol and somehow has the forethought to not shoot him the second she is able to despite her ""anger"" at him when she first meets him. Despite her greedy intentions somehow she becomes Goku's loyal companion on his noble quest to rid the world of evil to the point where she gives up the thing she was searching for to begin with. That in and of itself is alright if there is some explanation but apparently she has a split personality and decided to do so, the movie gives no explanation for it. The other characters are not better the drunken perverted old man who apparently is immensely strong and noble to the point of self sacrifice, the hot innocent school girl who is apparently a knowledgeable master about Ki and is a skilled fighter, and the evil villain who apparently has rather variable powers and skills (holds the grandfather still at the start without effort and kills him easily and yet at the end he doesn't even try that against Goku and is easily defeated). What is most annoying about the villain is they do not even explain how he escaped from his imprisonment which is mentioned in the movie often. The most powerful mystics sealed him yet here he is 2000 years later free as a bird and no one seems to have any clue how that could happen...not even the director.The only possibly good thing about this movie are the special effects, but even those are mediocre. In today's world you can create great special effects on a laptop computer and video games have amazing visual feats...in such an environment the light show in this movie is like a four year old with a sparkler on New Years in comparison to the fireworks overhead.This movie is horrible, I had only a base understanding of Dragonball so I cant comment on much more than the movie itself. I got in for free via a coupon and I feel ripped off, see this movie only if you want to make yourself miserable."
FeastMode,my notes,1/10,27 July 2019,"Hilariously bad. laughed so much. 7/10 on the hilariocity scale, 8/10 if you are a fan of the show. i don't even know why they'd base it on the show if they were just going to change EVERYTHING (2 viewings)

pike145,Utter failure in portraying the main character,1/10,9 May 2009,"1st off let me say that even before i saw the trailer, i knew this movie was going to be a load of crap. I mean did they honestly think they would get goku's hair right. After i saw the trailer i was even more convinced that this was definitely going to be a load of crap because: 1. Goku would never ever say he's not ready for anything. he was always up for any challenge and that was his character, fearless, heroic, unselfish, carefree, always looking forward to a fight and never really gave a crap about girls. Hollywood seems to portray the American marvel/dc super heroes to an almost 99% of the character in the comic and they really messed up on goku's personality. 2.I never really wanted them to make a movie based on the anime itself and i never really cared whether goku was white, Asian black or even a damn namek(OK, i might just have exaggerated that a bit but you get the gist of what I'm trying to say). Having a movie based on the anime series or sagas would just be boring cos we've seen it already. P.S. how is Piccolo able to control the wild Oozaru when we know that goku is supposed to be a super berserk huge ass crazy monkey who cant tell friend from foe? besides he's way to small in his oozaru form in any case and he still manges to keep his trademark orange gi intact, no rips tears) once he returns to normal which is a tad unrealistic. 3. Goku never really got a bashing in the movie which is kinda stupid considering how spider-man gets beaten to a pulp by the main villain(just like a human punching bag) the more goku fights the stronger his will becomes and that is what brings out his true strength. To sum it, in my personal opinion Hollywood just made this movie to either make a quick buck or to defame a truly great hero made by an Asian man who in my personal opinion is greater than any other American based comic book hero as well as any other anime hero as well. I never expected a DBZ kinda thing but this was WAY OFF from even the original dragonball itself"
bluetree_12,Not the Best Adaption Movie,2/10,28 March 2009,"This is apparently my first movie review ever posted on IMDb. I just feel like it's necessary to give out my opinions about DB-Evolution. As I clearly am disappointed in it.As a DB fan, I had watched several anime episodes and Akira Tokiyama was proved to be one of the most epic manga writers there are. To start out my rambling (Sorry but you can skip this if you want), I just want to say sorry to anyone who actually like this movie; because I can't really see what I should like in the movie.1. Goku is never attracted to woman. He's very naive and innocent to the outside world. Nor does he go to a high school. This is plainly ridiculous and hilarious at the same time. And to top it off, his character was gloomy. Where is the Goku that we love and know? About the actor, well, I can't really blame them for choosing a Western for it. This is a Hollywood movie. So it's kinda acceptable.2. What the heck happen to Yamcha?? The first time I saw his face appeared outside the hole I was thinking, ""WTH? Is this really Yamcha?"" First off, please, please choose the actors more wisely. I'm not a movie addict so I don't know whether Joon Park is actually good or not. But he definitely doesn't deserve to play Yamcha. He's not even close to similar in any way; his looks nor his personality.3. Different plot is acceptable if they choose to get different title and not claiming it DB. This has way too many differences from the manga that it doesn't deserve the title ""Dragonball"". If they want to make an action movie with a dragon in it; please make one with a different title and don't call it Dragonball because it can cause a lot of disappointing fans. Plus, I think the plot is very similar to Forbidden Kingdom. Minus the dragon, balls, and Picollo and you're set.4. Picollo was ridiculous. To start off, his make up wasn't even enough to gain me an image that he's actually evil. So make up - BAD. And I don't even know who's the girl that followed him everywhere until I browse through the internet. It was actually Mai, the hench-girl from Pilaf, I presume? If yes then, I don't know what else I can say. It's so bad that I'm speechless to comment anything on it.So that's basically the negative things about this movie. There are lots and lots of more but those are just my main concerns.Apart from that, however, I think Emma Rossum's acting is quite good in the start. Eventually getting worse at the end but it's quite acceptable. The blue hair still bothers me but hey, who wants to dye their hair blue. Well not me, at least. Although I think Krillin is definitely a more important character on DB series, (and should be put in this film) but Chichi is quite alright as well. I still disagree with the fact that Goku liked Chichi first, and that Chichi totally gives out an image of 'rich and popular girl' at school. But her and Emma Rossum's overall performance is good compared to others.You can be glad now as I'm finished with my rambling. End of my note, whoever make this film please make this as a lesson for you to improve better in the future. Thank you."
helmutty,It is purely for entertainment but even that it can disappoint.,6/10,14 March 2009,"The runtime is 1 hour 26 minutes. It is undeniably short and so you cannot expect some fantastic plot but non-stop action and some good action scenes. I would say that Dragonball has achieved being a mindless flick with non-stop action. But I must say I am a little disappointed with the action scenes and how short it is. First thing, the action and fighting scenes-they are messy and short. One fighting scene runs about 3-4 minute and they are not that fantastic. There is nothing special about the fighting scenes as some of them look messy. Even the final battle is short. I feel that it is quite short and if it is true that it cost US$100 million, it is very expensive. The special effect is not that awesome that makes you go ""Wow!"".The story: Yeah, as expected, the story is truly simple for all ages to understand. The strong point of Dragonball is supposed to be the fighting scenes but they are disappointing. The story is about Goku going on an adventure to find the seven hidden dragon balls after his grandfather tells him to before his death. From there, he needs to find master Roshi and some others company them on his quest to find the dragon balls before evil force finds them. As usual, Brian Tyler 's music is good and epic. His music makes the film more watchable.Overall: Kids will like this non-stop action adventure and the adults, depending on their taste, might also enjoy it. I have to say that I don't know much about Dragonball so I enjoyed the fun ride. Those looking for a mindless flick, may be interested in it. Those who hate plots that are lame and messy fight scenes, this may not suit you. It is slightly better than average."
The-Lone-Wolf,A Complete waste of time and money.,1/10,15 March 2009,"Despite having a rich and fantastically written source material, Dragonball Evolution takes it, and mutates it beyond all recognition. This movie is not so much an adaptation of Dragon Ball, but more of a Saturday Night Live parody. With lines and dialogue that would embarrass Adam West, a cast list resembling a Who's Who of..... Who?! This movie is a representative of FOX's shameless ability to annihilate a franchise for a few quick bucks.Pros: Well, its short, for one thing. Also, the fight scene where the punk totals his own car was flawless. Very Toriyama.Cons: The script was terrible, the casting was shameful, the fight scenes were nothing short of sloppy, and the overall production was lazy and uninspired.We were told that this is the first in a trilogy. Really FOX? Really? you need two more movies of this crap? Despite James Marsters being alive in a post credits scene, I'm not holding my breath for Dragonball 2. A reboot hopefully, but no sequel."
jwenson,"The Greatest Movie Ever Made...Oh, Wait, We're Talking About Dragonball:Evolution. Nevermind.",1/10,14 April 2009,"I can't believe I had to give this piece of crap a 1 out of 10. Zero (or even negative integers) should be an option. That's all I have to say. I am a huge Dragonball, Dragonball Z, and Dragonball GT fan, and I was anxiously awaiting this film for over a year now. I don't know where to begin with this film. The story was terrible. Oozaru was a disciple of Piccolo!? Piccolo looked like The Mask! Goku was so unsure of himself and his abilities it was sickening. ""I have to have faith in who I am,"" give me a freaking break! Master Roshi lives in an apartment building!? Bulma is a gun-toting bad ass!? Yamcha can't even fight! The 18th birthday and solar eclipse motifs have been overdone in the past and they just continued those hackneyed themes. I just wanted to vomit during this film. I could go on and on about what is wrong with this movie, but I don't want to develop and ulcer.

liberty_001,Offended as a fan....,3/10,12 April 2009,"What can in say, as a a fan of the series i am offended, it is obvious that the director only saw a few episodes and then wen on and made the movie. Like most people i had a bad feeling about the movie, i wasn't pleased whit the director, the cast, nothing. I believe the main reason why it flunked its because they were afraid to put in all the fantasy elements of the series, they got scared that audiences weren't going to accept them, but let me tell you that they would, at least 60% of the people that went to see the movie have seen the show, they were expecting to see bulma with blue hair, they were expecting to see master roshi whit the turtle shell, they were expecting to see krilling for god sakes !. To sum up,it is sad that the amazing franchise that is dragon ball, has this bump in its road."
Darkslide92,James Wong is a moron. Darn you James,2/10,25 March 2009,"Dragonball, my precious childhood cartoon, how much I hate to see you fall to the hands of such a pitiful director.What on earth was twentieth century fox thinking? James Wong is by far one of the most under-classed directors in the field, and they decided to put him on the Dragonball project? Has anyone looked at his movie history? He did the Final Destination movies, the first one was good but the rest were laughable. Also The One with Jet Li. To think that it would be really hard to make a movie stink with Jet Li in it. Guess what?...James Wong managed to do it.Also, what on earth was he thinking with the cast list? Justin Chatwin? What has he done that is noticeable? Oh and Joon Park. He has done two movies in the U.S. He was a driver in Speed Racer and now he is doing Yamcha and Dragonball. He did the audition in shorts and a t-shirt and he was given the part...excuse me? How can a director make such a poor decision when coming to auditions? Emmy Rossum was a good acting choice, but what is the point of good acting if you also have poor duologue? The writer also, look at his history. He has done almost absolutely nothing. Basically what twentieth century fox did was take the worst of everything and everyone to try to make a movie for fan-boys/girls. Look out it turned out.Now that I am done with the ranting, let me quickly summarize how this project should have been gone about.For a director, they should have told James to take a hike and hire someone who actually has a good amount of experience. If it were up to me then I would put Zack Snyder on the project. The man is a brilliant director with a visual mind unlike any other. Look what he did with 300 and Watchmen. I could definitely see him doing the same for Dragonball. As far as the cast, it is simple, find people with experience. The cast of Watchmen was not very noticeable before the movie but they did great with this movie because the director actually cared about the movie when it came to auditions. For a scriptwriter, It is not a hard concept, find a smart well known scriptwriter and have him adopt from the Manga. James Wong just seemed too lazy to do any of this. Anyone who is not James Wong would have known all of this which proves how under-classed he is.Do us a favor Hollywood. Redo this movie someday and tell James Wong to take a hike and do it right. Thank you for ruining this experience for me James, really."
saugeta,Fire every one that played N names R in the Movie!!!,1/10,20 April 2009,"I believe that every one that was involved with this movie should be fired. This movie has brought shame and anger to every American in this country! It's like they took the movie and slapped it on the face and walked all over it I watched the movie half way and I HAD to walk out!!!  It was a JOKE!!!... I have been waiting for a DB movie to come out and the day it comes out it's like all my dreams went down the drain. Who ever allowed to make this movie needs to get fired and everyone else!!!! Everything was low budget, the characters were dumb, and everything else was out of reality (in the DB world)!!!!... I am sure that everyone else agrees that this movie should be taken out of theaters and be burned till no more copies exist A new movie needs to come out by someone with money and people that are actually in shape!!! Not regular people and what is it with all of this old time praying things that are from the past a energy ball comes from energy not from anywhere else all of the energy balls r totally fake here I have seen LIL Kids in YouTube make better energy balls out from a room and a laptop I believe that I could of made a better movie myself if I have the time and equipment to do it."
e_nugo,Waste of Popcorn!!!,2/10,2 May 2009,"I can not agree more with most of the reviewers! The movie is so bad that I feel really guilty to eat my popcorn. Afterward I really think that my popcorn was too precious to be eat during such a movie! If you are a die hard fans of the comic...you will wish to have have all 7 Dragonball in your hand, so that you can make a wish that those who in charge in making this movie were never been hired!!!OK let's be fair...let's make a list what is good about the movie: 1.The color and the background, some time they were so beautiful and look like a big painting in the wall. If I could stop the movie, take a good picture of them, I thing it would worth as a background of a background (that no one can see).2. The ""Kamehameha"", it was so funny, reminds me of my best friend who always go the the toilet and scream a loud!3. .....I am sorry, it's just to painful to push my mind producing an imaginary good impression about the movie, please allow me stop here!I dedicated this review for my salty, beautiful popcorn...I am sorry, I really should keep you for the other (better) movie! James Wong..sir...you own me a big salty bag of popcorn!!!By the way, if you ask me why I give the 2 stars rather than 1, I should tell you that the other star is for my popcorn! They are just good and salty!"
tehlulz777,A Messterpiece of Epic Proportions,1/10,8 April 2009,"Remember the day you were exposed to the cinematic brilliance of There Will Be Blood,the great character study of Scorsese's Taxi Driver,the unbelievable quirkiness and charm of Magnolia, well,you better be forgetting them because Dragonball:Evolution is coming through and it will blow more than one mind.What you have here is a movie so emotionally devasting,that you will feel the need to be hit(twice if needed) by your friend if what you're seeing is actually real, this movie challenges the viewers to come up with their interpretations just like David Lynch's Eraserhead, The Holy Mountain and the mind-screwing Neon Genesis Evangelion(hopefully Fox picks up the rights of the show, so we can have another carefully crafted masterpiece like this one),the story is nothing short of riveting almost as good as Karate Kid and Kung-Fu Panda combined together-""Goku is a social misfit(just like he is in the anime) who gets bullied by the token black-guy and can't get the girl(just like in the anime - it feels like you are being wrapped into it)then his grandpa Gohan is killed by Piccolo(the aftermath of his death didn't feel exactly like Uncle Ben's death in Spider-Man, which was a relief cuz I had a weird feeling it would be similar)then Bulma appears and takes him to this guy Roshi,and then they go on to some cannon searching the so-called dragon balls,all right, and then they find Yamcha, cool, and hip as always with his funny one-liners,then he falls in love with Bullma and then Piccolo pops out, and the final fight between good and evil begins,they fight on and on and on... then in the middle of the fight Goku feels the need of taking a du... er... he transforms in some sorta ManBearPig-like monster(nice reference to South Park) called Ozaru and then Piccolo takes full-control of him or whatever I didn't pay much mind since my eyes were blurry from some of the action scenes and tears of joy of this tour-de force experience, some people may complain on how the story was shortened and rushed,but hey, it's not like you actually know your stuff, let the talented-one get it right,as cramming everything together in 90 minutes was the most obvious thing to do -DUH,the characters are so complex as they unfold throughout the movie,kids may have a hard time watching this cuz of the PG rating because the movie relies way too much on social commentaries against our society and the way we see life - for instance- the scene where Yamcha stars to talk out that cool-sounding stuff is obviously taken off from the harsh-times our economy is going through, you might be fooled on this one since Dragon Ball or Dragonball(whatever you may like to call it) was meant to be kiddy show, but here they kid you NOT.The character are a little different from their anime counterparts but it doesn't matter at all especially considering how you can actually connect with them in a emotional and witty way albeit complicated manner, we have Goku, brilliantly-written I must say though, lines such as ""teach me how to be normal"" and his awkwardness throughout the high-school scenes were a delight to the human eye, and kept me on the edge of my seat in an infinite loop of awe, Bulma, well, was a b... interesting character and so are Roshi, Chi-Chi, Yamcha - who were too depth for my own good though. And those nice-looking monks(so happy that Bill Murray was somehow injected in the scene), now let's get back to Piccolo, his motive is unknown, we don't what he really wants... destroy or control the world, that's the question, right? In my humble opinion I think it's up to the viewer to answer these questions just like what happened with The Joker in The Dark Knight so that makes it intriguing by default(and very cool, too). Nothing about this masterpiece felt like a cop out, I swear."" The battle scenes are (Y)AWWW-MA-ZZZZZZZZZZZ-ING, I'm not kidding you. One can notice that the idea for them definitely didn't come straight from Spider-Man or The Matrix, the cinematography was beautiful shot I may have collapsed during the movie because of its beauty, thankfully I was revived by the doctors in the theater who were bitting their own nails out of the pure excitement to see this ""legend"" come to life. At the end of the movie my whole-theater had a mad orgasm that could have been heard in the whole galaxy. I'm more than hopeful that this movie will beat the poop out of TDK and Titanic at the box-office and will spawn more sequels than Police Academy and The Land Before Time combined. After this movie I am proud to say that Tom Rothman is god, the way he rushes project... whoops, I mean the way he picks up franchises randomly and put them into production as fast as he can so the fans don't have to wait any longer without looking for a extended profit, he is a very kind individual, a man worth of trust, and we should all be thankful for that, may Jebus bless yer little caring heart.I AM also so glad that my children will grow up with movies like this and not those overrated Miyazaki's movies which are boring and lame besides every single movie(released or yet-to-be-released) will fall flat in comparison to this milestone of cinema. Especially taking into account that it takes place in a culture blinded by Kayne West, Fergie, Crapformers, American Psycho...For my money THE SINGLE BEST MOTION PICTURE OF THIS CENTURY. Still, Isn't that great that everyone's children will grow up with this sincere and honest movie. Kamehaha-IT."
alkaizen,"From dragon ball, only have the names",3/10,9 April 2009,"Before watch, i checked DBE on IMDb and saw the bad reviews, but i wanted to check myself, poor Toriyama, what they did with your creation? I have nothing against the characters, is just a awful script/direction.Hollywood ruined it like they did with ""Street Fighter"".Some wrong things:-The world from DBE is not like real dragon ball world, which is is a mix from prehistoric (with dinosaurs) and futuristic (with flying cars and stuff).-Bulma is not specialist in weapons.-Goku is humble, not cocky and horny.-Goku and Chi Chi never went to school.-Mai is Pilaf's follower not piccolo's.-Piccolo never had a spaceship (why he need one? he can fly).-Piccolo never had a follower (in DBE he have 2: Mai and Oozaru(!?)).-Goku (or any Saiyajin) turns into Oozaru when see the full moon not eclipse.-Goku (or any Saiyajin) should have an tail.-Grandfather Gohan died when Goku was like 2~3 years old not 18.-To summon Shenlong don't need go to a special place.-Oozaru is giant (like King Kong).-The Bulma's vehicle was more like Transformers than the original, which is stored inside a capsule that you throw and poof (some smoke) and the thing appear."
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,This film does the impossible.,1/10,21 October 2021,"Dragonball Evolution ISN'T Dragon Ball at all; it's a cheap imitation of a MUCH stronger media franchise and fails to capture a fraction of its charm during its torturous 1-hour-30-minute~ runtime. I'm fairly certain the screenwriter never read the comic/manga at all and just read up on the Wikipedia entries on Dragon Ball without thoroughly studying what made the story so beloved and timeless. The same goes for the director too; the lack of care in this film is incomparable to anything else Hollywood's done with comic book movies, and for that alone I commend them for making such an embarrassing movie.This movie is a cliche-ridden headache that has quite easily become my least favourite movie of all time. It's THAT bad! The characters are total disservices to their original counterparts, the fun and pure imagination of the manga is non-existent here, the Westernisation of the settings and aesthetics makes Dragonball Evolution a truly nauseating experience. Also, the fighting wasn't NEARLY as good as it was in the source material; that and everything else.Dragonball Evolution doesn't work as a self-contained story, it outright fails as a Dragon Ball adaptation, and above all else it's not remotely escapist material at all; it's diverging from the source material and nauseating high school romance subplot makes for one helluva bad movie. Thank Christ it flopped at the box office.0/5 stars; I know, I can only vote as low as 1 star but by god this film deserves a specially designated 'zero stars' rating. I rarely think ANY film deserves to be discarded as such, but there you go. Dragonball Evolution is quite easily a contender for the worst movie EVER made."
geraldhans,Awful,1/10,25 March 2009,"Judging from the trailer, I don't expect much what will be in the movie. Acting are quite Okay but storyline are really awful. This movie can't be compared to Original Dragonball. Well, at the beginning is quite okay but as the story goes, make me want to sleep. And even what they did to Bulma? Bulma didn't carry any gun (If I not mistaken). Well to be honest, I just may advised for those who still have respect Dragonball, I recommended you not to watch this movie as you will get angry after watching this movies. Sorry for all the cast, but I only be able to give 1/10. However for those of didn't like Dragonball, you might find this movie is interesting.

JayWolfgramm,No amount of Wishes can Save this Movie,1/10,25 March 2023,"One of the worst adaptations of a beloved franchise. One of the worst live action versions of an animated property. More concisely said, just one of the worst movies of all time.It is fascinating the changes they decide to make to the story. They do everything in their power to make this story more generic and less interesting. I want to be in the meeting where they thought having Goku go to high school dealing with bullies was a good idea.The effects are awful, the acting is awful, the story will take mindless detours that wastes the audience and character's time. Not being faithful to the source material is one thing but being this bad is something else entirely.It really is something that has to be seen to be believed. It is the car crash that you can't help but stop and stare. It is a disaster so bad, no amount of Shenron wishes would be able to save it."
Ali_John_Catterall,A load of old Dragonballs,1/10,25 July 2010,"It must be a real drag being a Jungian archetype. Aside from the inconvenience of possessing a thousand faces, imagine minding your own business, practicing judo with some wise and wily sage, when you're suddenly handed a magic sword or glowing swishy stick or cosmic catapult and tipped headlong into some damn-fool quest to go and rescue a princess and kill your dad - no, hang on, wrong shrink - or confront some Dark Lord (who may actually turn out to be your dad, bummer), while also confronting the darkness within your own soul (look harder, not using the recycling bin doesn't count).And the real bore of it all is, the thing that makes you want to stick your arms in a mincer, is that you know exactly what's going to happen next, which charming rogue you're going to meet on the road, which cuckolding temptress you're going to wind up married to for the next 100 years, and precisely which one of your battle-hungry, blood-crazed stepsons is going to do you in with a pillow when you're no longer fit to preside over a model railway set.The story is old, but it goes on. And it's always a pleasure when it's well told. But when plots and characters are as insultingly stock as they are in Dragonball Evolution, you start fervently praying for a bit of Jodorowsky-style subversion, possibly involving the heroine, the Dark Lord, a sackful of syringes and a malnourished donkey called Carlos. This resembles a fever dream you might have had after slipping into an E-number-aggravated blood sugar crash while watching The Star Wars Trilogy. Dragonball Evolution is so derivative, such a bare-faced rip-off of George Lucas' pension, that it actually seems completely pointless to pick holes in it. You might as well just attack the originals for their myriad faults and get two birds with one stone.""In an ancient time, Earth was nearly destroyed"" begins the ponderous voice-over.""Not by man, but by Gods from the sky..."" Most dramas smuggle their exposition in via the dialogue. This one just ram raids it out of the store. For what it's worth, the story involves a young hero called Goku, played by the Westerner Justin Chatwin (slightly creepily playing an 18 year-old at age 26) who embarks on a quest for the titular world-saving Dragon Balls after his martial artist grandpa Gohan is killed off by the evil Lord Piccolo (Marsters, resembling an over-sized Jawa with food poisoning). Will Goku manage to harness the powerful force called Ki and confront his own werewolf side? Find Master Roshi - who trained grandpa in turn? Defeat Piccolo - probably the only villain named after a small flute? And win the love of ass-kicking classmate Chi Chi? Seriously? There's probably a point to be made about the eternal exchange of cultural currency; Japan wresting back characters and plot lines from Lucas, then flogging them to the West again; Eastern aesthetics filtered through American sensibilities. But frankly, that's just the way the world works. The good news is this is only 84 minutes long. And if they knocked another 80 minutes off, it would be just about perfect."
trailertrashthorne,Why this movie is getting and DESERVES all the hatred,3/10,1 April 2009,"OK, first off let get this in the clear. Whenever you are going to make a film using names, items, settings, etc. from a franchise as big as DBZ you would take into account that nearly 98% of your viewers will be fans of the franchise. (DBZ) Apparently James Wong does not agree. But, hey, everyone knew withing 5 months of preproduction that they weren't going to follow the story so we all did this. We all accepted that it wasn't a DBZ movie and watched it expecting at least an OK movie considering they had a budget of *cough cough* one hundred million dollars! *holds pinkie to mouth* OK heres the serious. The movie was atrocious. It was closer to the power rangers than the z fighters. None of the characters remotely resembled the anime selves, in looks or attitudes. Even just as a movie it fails. Its like something an 8 year old would love. I wont even say 9 because my 9 year old brother watched my burned version and he hated it!Terrible acting from everyone, except Fat. However I wont defend him; he choose to do this because he had no money I'm sure. Another thing that ticked me off was in the scene where Chi Chi cant open her locker. Well first off you later find out she's a world class fighter so, couldn't she just rip it off it's hinges? Second off, Goku sees so he blows all the lockers away using his Ki energy, and Chi Chi doesn't freak out? She just replies, ""hey you used your Ki."" Even in the show, which had animals as people in it; everyone freaks out at how unreal it is when they use energy blasts.Whatever i don't care if i get deleted for this, it needs to be said. JAMES WONG CAN BLOW ME"
mikey_055,Film Does Deserve its 3!!,3/10,15 April 2009,"OK were to start, with this awful movie. First fan in and out. ,have the original anime series on DVD (well the ones that are out). Second At least it is considered a start, a good start...no, terrible start, but a start nonetheless.Characters, master roshi, good actor choice no one can argue, but he had to be more perverted towards bulma/more perverted anyway and has to be more clumsy in my opinion. The character as Goku, my lord, cliché after cliché. Knowing the results before they happen leaves no experience to go on with the movie (it isn't hard to guess after each incident what will/would happen next). And how come Goku wasn't getting trained to much or use of his stick (by Roshi), tell about 'rushed' results. Last for Goku is..""The HAIR"", young, old, new, anything, Goku is known for the hair, not somewhat a 70's cut like in this movie, but actually hair that is so out there like the anime's, people know him just by the hair (hair result in movie = failed). For piccolo, the fan that wrote on IMDb, Piccolo, 'looks like a vampire and his costume is matrix to a T', nailed it on the review. It's 2009 and piccolo looked like 1999 horror movie, and his clothes??? where is the cap and hat that weigh him down in training come on give me/us something!! Yamcha wasn't bad (by bad, his acting was OK), but kind of useless (his character). I guess the director never really saw or understood the Yamcha character from the anime (i wont spoil, watch the movie, understand the cartoon and you'll see). Yamacha supposed to be some what a good fighter, epically in DB not so much DBZ or DBGT, although in all of them Yamcha stands out most in DB as a strong/somewhat equal fighter to Goku. In this movie, he was just a bandit, with no talent except to rob.....bore! Now for the females, meaning Chi Chi and Bulma/hell even the other 'bad' chick. All are beautiful(bulma more than the others), Chi Chi(second) was like a goku character, cliché after cliché, knowing either what her line is/was going to be, or knowing what will/would/is going to happen to her, or around her. Bulma's role wasn't to bad (although needs more GREEN to her hair, maybe she can borrow some from the awful looking Piccolo), she was what she kind of is/was in the amine. Smart/and a good fighter. The cheesiness in her lines comes from what the director puts in the script so you can't fault her for those. The morphing chick mai, pretty but in the end useless. Yea she helps the evil character to conquer the earth but come on, her powers aren't and were never really useful to help someone like a Piccolo. You can tell when she morphs to someone else, and is going to be plotting evil or bad things (i wont mention parts in movie, but you will be strictly able to guess them while watching/if ever watching :)).In the end i say 3, why? Because it does use the name dragonball, and does have dragonball characters, and tries to be/tie the 'dragonball' concept but fails, and fails miserably. So it's like a bad action movie, except fans of the original anime/and others will want to watch this movie just to see what 'bad' action for a DB/DBZ/DBGT fan really means.2 last notes - Visual effects, it looks 50/50 on arguments for these....unless they were low on cash, the effects plain out suck, i can do better with the comp I'm using to write this. No offense, people that think there OK to Good, i dunno what movie you were watching but the effects were below par..and far below par, like the script of this movie. Second - Oh yea, the dragon (shenron), did anybody find the dragon was like the size of a big whale or something (not to be funny?? Remember this dragon (Shenron) is supposed to be the size of the earth/universe/ something huge to show how important he is, and in the movie, he is like the 'baby Shenron' so tiny and looks useless (useless by how he grants the wish's), and why dosen't he talk??Anyways 3/10, that's pushing the 3."
kenwang,"Please IMDb, can I have a vote lower than 1?",1/10,8 April 2009,"My expectation was really high when the news to make a Dragon Ball movie years back. I wasn't actually following the development of the movie since. And barely months ago, I seen the first trailer available for Dragon Ball Evolution. Oh man, you cannot belief my disgust. ""It's not a dragon ball movie"" screams my sub-conscious. For goodness sake, it doesn't even feel like Dragon Ball universe.Alright, I have to watch the movie anyhow (admit being a huge fan of the series minus GT). In fact, I just returned from a showing in Brisbane, Australia. Okay, I went into the theater with little expectation. Yet I was willing to bet on the tiny little possibility that I will like the film. I was like ""please.... let there be a little thing that surprises me, let there be something DBZish that I can relate to"".Let me set the record straight. I was TOTALLY DEVASTATED.....It's almost like watching yet another teenage movie, except DB characters names were used. It was like watching kung-pao and said it was a set in the ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" world. (mind you, I actually enjoyed kung pao).I think Dragon Ball Evolution will eventually become a page in history of ""what's not to do with manga"". A earlier reviewer said ""DB evolution was created for people who hate DB"". I saw that comments before watching the movie, and now I totally agrees with it."
mrdonleone,good I never saw the series,3/10,9 April 2009,"I am going to try to show this movie wasn't that bad as they say, but annoying as hell.yes, I am a lucky guy I never saw the original television animation series of Dragon Ball Z, so I had no expectations at all for this movie. a friend of mine wanted to see this movie and because I like movies too, he asked me to go with him. we already heard a lot of bad criticism about this picture, but he was a great fan of the series, so this film was a must see for him. I went too, because that's what friends must do: go take the good times, go take the bad, and take it together.the movie started and he really was ashamed of bringing me to such BEEP, but I said 'hey don't worry, it's just a movie, I will survive this. after all, this isn't so bad.' and I was right. it wasn't as bad as Derek Jarman's 'The Garden', but it certainly wasn't as good as 'Monsters vs Aliens' (a movie I consider bad).the storyline was new for me and I found it quite amusing. however, after wards I heard this friend was so mad at the director to (in his own words) rape this excellent animation series. I didn't mind at all he was saying that, because I didn't like it that much.conclusion: I can say this movie has made me very tired. so if you want to sleep, don't hesitate and go see this movie."
pink_tink-1,I'm so sad,1/10,5 April 2009,"OK. From the time I started watching Dragonball it was a very good cartoon. And what the creators did is wrong. I feel if you are going to make a movie based off a series of anime, I say please watch the anime first. It will give you knowledge about the characters and you can create a better storyboard. The Dragonball series has been out for 30 years, and from what I have seen from this movie, you did the exact opposite. To the people who have not seen the series...watch it first and understand what is happening, so when you see this bad creation of a movie you will understand what has been done. Im sorry but I am unhappy with this film.

mulder71-1,An Abomination to the Series of Dragonball,1/10,4 April 2009,"James Wong should not be allowed to direct again . His arrogance towards the beloved Japanese Anime and Manga is such a slap in the face for all fans of the Series .For one thing Goku is not a Human he is a Saiyan from another world (and in the early dragonball had a tail) , Bulma was a tech genius , not a fighter . Chi Chi was a Goku's love interest(and wife in later times) and was daughter to the Ox King . Krillin where was he ??? Gokus best friend. Roshi was a dirty old man in the series and had a turtle shell on his back . I could go on , but , I suggest for any Dragonball fan , just , not watch this movie .

bzyth,god help us all,1/10,7 April 2009,"OK i wonder if the people in Hollywood realize that one they !@#$ed up the story so badly that any true dragon ball fan will be outraged by this film and never go see it. you cant go and make your own spin off of a series that is one of the most popular anime on earth. plus the way this movie looks it should be a straight to DVD movie and hope to get money off the people that don't know any better. any true dragon ball fan should just pretend that this movie does not exist and refuse to see it. and those people who think that his movie has a chance in hell to be good should just not speak. this movie will destroy the series just like dragon ball GT after this movie is released you can kiss a comeback of dragon ball good bye

rcolgan,Don't Bother With This. Just Watch The Anime.,2/10,14 August 2015,"Dragon Ball is an epic saga of a kid named Goku, who travels the world to find 7 mystical balls of power to stop them from falling in to the hands of evil. In his travels he constantly overcomes his own limits to defeat any opponent in his way, protect his friends and become the greatest fighter in the world. It was a great anime that had many memorable characters and some of the most impressive action sequences on television. Dragonball Evolution on the other hand is an hour and a half of disappointment, watching as franchise that has such an enormous fan-base be ruined, losing all the charm that made the anime it was based on great to begin with.Obviously it's understandable for a film adaptation to make changes from the source material, but there is so little here that even resembles the anime that it's based on. It does keep the basic story the same. Goku and his friends are still trying to collect the dragon balls to prevent them from falling in to the hands of the likes of the evil Lord Piccolo. They also try to incorporate various other mythos from the show like the Kamehameha wave, but they fail at doing it well. All of the explanations of the universe and Goku's powers are rushed over so quickly that people new to the series will be lost and loyalists of the franchise will be annoyed at how poorly these mythos are incorporated in the film. Also whilst the characters share the same names as their anime counterparts, this is about as far as their similarities go. Goku's personality is changed from being a light minded fool who cares about only doing good and being the best fighter he can be, to being a typical teenage kid who spends most of the film having a crush on Chi Chi. Roshi's nothing more than a generic master who Goku finds. Bulma is just a Lara Croft type character without any of the attitude that made her character enjoyable. The character closest to their anime counterparts ends up being Lord Piccolo, since at the least he looks like the villain that he's based on. Everyone else suffers from worse miscasting than The Last Airbender movie with all the cast having nothing in common with their respective roles.It's also a dreadfully made film on a technical level, with director James Wong taking the epic world destroying fights from the original anime and turning them into amateuristic sequences that seem like they were made by a film student. They use a mixture of awful choreography with the fighters moving slowly and fast paced editing where each shot will last no more than a second at a time. Plus for a film with a 45 million dollar budget, the effects really suck. When the 2D cartoon that the film is based on looks more realistic than the effects do, it's pretty obvious that you screwed up. This film fails in every way. It won't appeal well to people unfamiliar to Dragon Ball since the characters and story are so generic, whilst being a terribly made mess of a film. And fans are certain to hate it since it fails to recapture anything that made the franchise great to begin with. It doesn't even feel like a real film. It feels like one of those parody trailers you see in something like The Simpsons that spoof how bad Hollywood is at with adaptations got turned into a real film. If you want to enjoy Dragon Ball just stick with the anime."
lie_it80,Dragonball: Failution,1/10,2 May 2009,"Where to start... hmmm First of all, i think we all know what Dragon Ball is. I watched it all the time when i was a kid. When i saw the trailer for this movie, i knew it was going to be bad, but after seeing the actual movie, it was worst them i thought.What is bad:1) A complete different storyline (but we all knew that) 2) Bad actors3) Bad scenes, introductions to story parts etc 4) There's almost no fight at all in this movie (really)5) To many kis? I mean are those kis? Are those kamehame? They light stuff? wow amazing... 6) The special effects are terrible. They look like Adobe After Effects7) The oozaru... LOL 8) The dragon... LOL is that Spyro? 9) The final fight scene is ridiculous 10) The ending is more ridiculous them ridiculousNow the good:1) Hot girls 2) Wait... there's actually seven dragon balls in this movie!! 3) Oh my! There's a guy called Son Goku! Just like in the anime!I advice you to not, TO NOT see this movie. You already know its bad, but you have no idea how bad it really is. Stay away from this, stay home, eat some chips and watch whatever is on television: its way better them the movie. If you watch this i bet you will regret it, like me."
moviemattb,A Slap in the Face,1/10,7 August 2014,"I have always been a big fan of ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball Z,"" while ""Dragon Ball GT"" not sure if that will hold up well (Might need to have a look back at it). I have heard that this was first announced that Hollywood was going to make a live- action adaptation of not only the show, but the manga and I do not know if this movie was going to work because it might either suck or surprise me the heck out of me. As the movie was already being filmed, set photos were posted and we all thought that this movie was going to suck. Trailers didn't help, photos didn't help, or anything that was being marketed for. I did say to myself that if this movie was good its ""Transformers,"" but if its bad, then it is the ""Super Mario Bros."" (Referring to the live action movie). So I did watched the movie, and I was not the only one alone because we were all right that this movie really sucks so bad. If you think ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is worse than this movie, think again because I think this movie is even worse than the second Transformers movie, and I think that one is more entertaining than this pile of junk! ""Dragonball Evolution"" is one of the worst movies that was adapted from a popular franchise, which it has nothing much to do with the source material. If I mean nothing much to do, which now makes this movie a slap in the face to all fans, including myself, who all love ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball Z."" This has a butt-load of problems, and everything about this movie is all wrong. James Wong was not the right choice to direct the movie. It should have been Stephen Chow because he said that he was fan of the series. I never saw ""Kung-Fu Hustle"" but I still think he should have direct the movie; if not, then maybe it should have been the Wachowskis because they need knew how bring an artistic style for the visuals, and the action scenes like ""The Matrix Trilogy"" and ""Speed Racer."" The action in this movie are not well done because they are not that exciting as what the show did. If you have seen what Zack Snyder had done with the action scenes in ""Man of Steel,"" then this is what the movie should have because the action in ""Man of Steel"" were awesome. The story itself is not well written, and does have a bunch of clunky dialogue that doesn't seem to have a ""Dragon Ball"" feel. The special effects in this movie are not stunning to look at, and are not that impressive like the effects in ""Avatar,"" ""Inception,"" or any other movies that have great special effects. The acting is not really that good for most of the cast, but they at least tried. Justin Chatwin as Goku was actually not that bad because he at tried to be the character that we all loved, and I thought he looked fine wearing that famous outfit he wore during the last action scenes of the movie (As well as doing the Kamehameha). Emmy Rossum looks nothing like Bulma, and having one little blue color on her hair was not good enough. James Marsters did not do a great to play Piccolo, while the makeup itself isn't that great either. Jamie Chung as Chi-Chi was not a bad choice, but doesn't bring anything new to table except being a lover to Goku. Chow Yun-Fat playing Master Roshi in this movie pretty much killed his career. As for the rest of the cast, were all done pretty awful. The movie does have some plot holes like Goku transforming into an Ape (Which looks nothing like it) that doesn't have a tail, Roshi healing Goku with the Kamehameha that doesn't heal because it should have been Goku eating a Senzu Bean, and Goku's outfit not being ripped after transforming into an ape and going back to being human. The movie tries to be realistic like movies such as ""The Dark Knight Trilogy,"" ""Man of Steel,"" ""Arrow,"" and many others. This movie doesn't need to be, and there is no way that it can be possibly work. I'd seen movies and TV shows that worked better to be realistic while this and the ""Super Mario Bros."" movie don't work at all. I really don't like this movie, and I know that everyone has seen this movie are not completely satisfied; even Akira Toriyama creator of ""Dragon Ball"" and ""Dragon Ball Z"" hated this movie because they pretty much ignore on what Toriyama had in mind with his ideas for the movie. If you are going to do a reboot live-action interpretation of the show and the manga, then do it right as you respect the source material. Before I conclude this, I do like to say that the song ""Rule"" by Ayumi Hamasaki was actually pretty awesome because it does get the feeling of ""Dragon Ball."" I do listen to this song on my iPod, and I think it should be in a better ""Dragon Ball"" movie than this. Also, I really love Brian Tyler's score for the movie, which I thought it was awesome. So, yeah, those were some of the good things that I liked about while the rest of the movie sucks. Lastly, for right now, I rather go see and watch ""Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods"" over this movie that is trying to cash in with the name that carries the title ""Dragon Ball."" The new DBZ movie is animated, and it has the English Funimation Dub cast; go see and watch that one instead of this poorly adaptation of a movie. I never saw it, but I really want to. I give this movie a 1 out of 10."
ryanwinning1,This is so far from Dragonball....,1/10,29 January 2019,"Was going through my DVDs and spotted this as a red flag. Removing this from my DVD collection. Waste of space. This is movie is so far from capturing anything dragonball. They could have made a better movie with a bunch of cosplay people from comicon.

Benihana26,Potato.,1/10,16 June 2019,"A potato would make a better movie than this. A literal vegetable. I've seen potatoes being more entertaining and true to their vegetables roots than this movie. The difference between this movie and a potato is that this movie should stay in the ground and never be consumed. It's a fact that you can live off potatoes. It's also a fact that this movie will devour your will to live. Potato good. Movie bad.

dudedazzreviews,KAMEHAMAE-fail!,1/10,7 October 2010,"This is a monstrosity from start to finish. The story wasn't really entertaining at all, the acting made me cringe, the characters were uninteresting and boring and the action sequences were dull. Yeah there were one or two action scenes that kept your attention a little bit but everything about this movie just makes you want to try every method possible in trying to erase it from your memory. The writing is beyond terrible and the direction was just poor. If you have trouble sleeping, turn this on and you'll fall asleep within the first five minutes of the movie.As a movie reviewer, I have to be honest with you and with myself. I'm a fan of the television series and I liked watching the shows and when I heard that this was going to be released, I had mixed views. As much as I really wanted to like this movie, I knew that it wouldn't really be very good. I thought that it would be average or below average but I cleared my mind of those doubts before watching this movie and after watching the movie, I realised I was right. Dragonball Evolution fails on almost everything on so many levels and is truly a disappointment. The characters were just awful and the one thing that bugged me the most about this movie was Picollo because his make-up was awful, he looked really out of place in the movie. I'm actually quite surprised that Stephen Chow has made some great movies such as the unforgettable and funny Kung Fu Hustle and then takes part with this tripe. From cheesy dialogue and dire acting to bad special effects and dull action sequences, Dragonball Evolution may entertain the children and young teenagers and possibly fans of the show but if you're looking for a great action movie, give this a miss.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"
garytanker2002,It Sucks,1/10,18 March 2009,"If not know to you the movie does not go with the anime at all, its horrible! There are You tube videos better then this movie. I really wanted to see this movie be good to. www.animecrazzy.net now has parts of the movie but its crappy. If you like the anime hopefully you will outcast this movie. I thought it was going to flow well with Dragonball this movie is a distracts to all Dragonball or DBZ fan around the world. I was sad when I saw it made me thing a group of high school kids could make a better move then this. now it sound like I'm totally dissing this movie and i am I would not pay to see this movie. this movie should end out with those Atari 2600 ET games.

doomsdaycs,A absolute disaster!,3/10,9 May 2009,"When i knew , goku was going to be an American , a year ago , i had a very ominous feeling about the film , and when i saw the theatrical trailer , i knew then that FOX has completely destroyed this Asian epic! This is what you get when someone tries to Americanize a true masterpiece!As an ardent fan of db/dbz/dbgt i was shocked to see , as to how bad a movie can really get!!! Bad acting by almost all actors , very poor visual effects , i've seen movies in the 80's have better visual effects . Bad directing , bad screenplay , bad story , they've tampered the story so bad that i was so devastated after watching the film , had sleepless nights for days . Watch the movie and u'll see what i mean ! This is what happens when you take a film without seeing one ***king episode , rather the director has developed the movie after reading a summary! The movie was so bad that u'd cry even in the scenes that the director meant to be funny and vice versa! My advice is that don't watch this film , do something more worthwhile like cursing the director!!!!!"
wynonasbigbrownbeaver,Chow Yun Fat gave up a major role on Red Cliff.....For THIS?!,3/10,10 August 2009,"There is not much worth mentioning on Dragon Ball Evolution with its 75 minute run time.All I can say is... it's pretty much dumb on all parts. Special effects are okay. The Editing is bad when it comes to fight choreography. I wasn't expecting stellar acting or anything remotely serious, but it didn't need to be THIS bad. The script was horrible and some of miscast characters were unnecessary other than pure eye candy and sub par choreography. (For example Jamie Chung and Emmy Rossum).Speaking of miscasting-everyone was miscast. Chow Yun Fat was HORRIBLE in this, I couldn't stand listening to his voice on screen. This movie was beneath him and he should have known better. Jason Chatwin was pretty bland and forgettable too.Also what was insulting to my intelligence was the writing. They mean to tell me that after wasting time waiting around in a deep hole on the brink of Armageddon, Master Roshi can simply FLY out of it? How did this get through the final draft?Other than that. I tried not to take this seriously. I knew it was going to suck and was unchanged in my opinion because I know why it sucked. If you don't see this movie, you're not missing much. This was merely a hot product that had a short life span. I don't ""hate"" this movie, but I do think it was very stupid. I don't recommend Dragonball Evolution. Watch the beloved cartoons instead."
SophomoreSlump,I'm Speechless...,4/10,29 March 2009,"In all the interviews before the movie was released, James Wong, Justin Chatwin and even James Masters told us how much this movie will remained faithful to the manga and anime, but also with an added bonus such as the modern setting and the realism so that it looks like it is set in the real world. Thus, I had my hopes high.Walking into the cinema, I sat down with my popcorn as the reel started to roll. A fast prologue explains that 2,000 years ago, the evil Lord Piccolo tried to destroy the world with the help of his monstrous demon, Oozaru and was only imprisoned by a brotherhood of mystics. The film then skips to present day, as young Goku spars with his grandfather. As a gift for his 18th birthday, Grandpa Gohan gives Goku a dragonball, briefly explaining that only seven of the balls exist and when they are united a dragon is summoned which can grant one perfect wish.Okay, it still sticks to the original story. Fair enough.But on the same day, Piccolo emerges, freed from shackles, with his lady assistant in an airship, trying to find the Dragonball. All the while, Goku is at a school party trying to woo his high school crush, Chi Chi when his grandfather is killed by Piccolo who couldn't find the Dragonball. With his last breath, Goku's grandfather tells him to find Master Roshi, who lives on a small island in the middle of town, and find the rest of the Dragonballs to save the world.Okay, maybe some few changes. I can live with that.Goku then went on a ""Wizard of Oz""-like adventure, where he seeks the Dragonball and meets a few friends along the way. At least the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion have more characteristic and development than Bulma, Master Roshi and Yamcha.Everything happened too fast. Goku had his training with Roshi on the way to find the Dragonball and learns the Kamehameha ""theorically"", because Roshi just tells him how to do it and in the final battle, he did it.The actor that really (or, almost) lives out the character is James Masters playing Lord Piccolo. We can feel his anger and vengeful drive towards the Earth, though we still do not know why, or how he was freed. And unfortunately, he gets so little screen time that the movie-maker could have just use CGI and spare Masters from wasting his time. Chatwin was also a great actor and was a real Goku... if Goku was such a moody and one dimensional character.But I guess what save the movie is the special effect and the storyline itself (which is from the manga; the ""Demon Lord Piccolo"" Saga). The special effect is really awesome (no where near Transformers or Watchmen, but still); everything looks real. From the background to the slow-motion fight scene and even the Kamehameha. And the plot was also entertaining, although it could have been done way better.Dragonball Evolution looks like a very high-budget B-movie, or something straight to DVD or TV.As soon as the movie ended, I was speechless.But the there was a short scene during the credits. Stay if you want, but I know a lot of Dragonball fans would already know what it is.Dragonball Evolution; recommended....if you have never read or watched the manga or anime and would like to just kill some time off the weekends."

greigsj2001,If you like the Show avoid the movie,3/10,23 March 2009,"OK I'm reviewing this while watching it so Yeah apologise for the ruff edges , my main issues with this movie is not the casting however it is an issue , its the apparent disregard for the story there are massive plot gaps previously cover'd in the show like Gokus grandpa being killed by piccolo instead of being killed by Goku when he transformed , Goku not having a tail etc.. stuff like that , if you've ever watched the Dragon ball , or Dragon ball z then this movie will aggravate you the the point of migraine Now lets move to the casting issues lets start with the Pros: master Roshi , Yamcha and even Goku to and extent are played surprisingly well and keep to the shows characters Roshi is a dirty old pervert , Yamcha is a money chasing scoundrel , and Goku is the good guy pure and simple CONS : and these are the real bones to pick Chi chi , Bulma & Piccolo are played ridiculously badly they have no Clue what there doing it feels to me that James Wong (director) watched like 3 episodes and said yeah lets butcher this , Bulma is flat there's no real spark from her no chemistry with Goku or Yamcha , Chi chi is some teenage cheer leader type doesn't really come across as the warrior princess from the show & Piccolo Ah where to begin Using James Masters just didn't work he just doesn't have the presence required to play such a Strong character his performance just came of as weak and not very engrossing. Now that weave got that out of the way i can tackle the Movies flaws as a whole most of the movie as drawn out with very little action , some shallow references to stables of the show like the Kame Hame ha etc... but to me it's missing way to much to even call itself a dragon ball movie so Manny characters don't make an appearance such as , krillin Goku's best friend , Tien , ChuSu , Mr Po Po , Corin the list goes on and for a move called dragon ball it cant quite decide when its taken place its seams to jump and take elements from later and try and mix them , for example goku is 18 in this movie and in the show by that time he has met Bulma ,Yamcha,Master Roshi and beaten the RR army and defeated king piccolo were in this hes had an uneventful childhood as soon as he reaches 18 all manner of crap happens also in the end battle when you expect to see a excellent fight sequence your instead treated to Goku's supposed transformation in to Ozaru in the show a Giant destructive ape in the movie a guy that badly needs shaved .in conclusion and i apologise for ranting , but i grew up with these shows and it really aggravates me when directors bastardise them like thieve done here , I've waited for years to see this show brought to the big screen and to see some of the epic sagas play out with real actors and see what a Hollywood budget could do to improve a beloved franchise ...., if this movie is anything to go by Not a frigging LOT if your a fan of the SHOW then for your own sake AVOID this Luke warm Puddle of excrement calling its self a movie ."
Goken21035,Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.,1/10,15 April 2009,"If I could, I'd give this a nice big goose egg, but unfortunately, I can't.I had the misfortune of watching this pile of vomit yesterday, and lemme tell ya, it's so bad, you can't even laugh while watching it. You find yourself sitting in disbelief that a movie based on an epic manga/anime series could be so horrible. The dialogue alone was enough to make me want to kill myself, but it was so much worse than that.The action scenes are contrived, lifeless affairs that'll probably leave you thinking, ""Good god, my grandmother could do better than that!"". The love story that develops between Goku and Chi-Chi is so poorly done I barely realized it even occurred. And you can forget the whole ""Roshi-training-Goku"" aspect, because it's almost nonexistent. There are, I dunno, maybe two or three short scenes in which Roshi is giving vague advice while either moving his arms around or just sitting on his ass.Piccolo beats Grandpa Gohan to a pulp and blows his house up. Whoops.Oh yeah, and Goku and Chi-Chi are high school students, and Goku gets *gasp* teased by some guys that don't like him. And they run over his bike. Those meanies. You can tell Goku's mad when they mess with him because the way he scrunches his face up.Goku gets invited by Chi-Chi to her house for a party later, and when I say ""house"", I mean ""mini-castle with a gigantic front wall"". Because, you know, all high school students live in houses like that.If you're wondering why I haven't mentioned Yamcha yet, it's because that while he *was* in the movie, he didn't do anything of any importance whatsoever.Ugh, thinking about this atrocity is giving me a headache. I cannot understand why anyone would enjoy this movie. I really can't. It's bad. It's horrible. It's a crime against both the series and cinema itself. James Wong can't direct and both him and Ben Ramsey can't write screenplays.Don't go see it, or you'll get a headache too. And probably a nasty case of nausea."
anubhav-dasgupta,No thank you for ruining Dragonball,1/10,30 April 2009,"I was one of those unwise guys who ignored all the negativity surrounding this movie and made the mistake of watching it. I hate James Wong for ruining my childhood as well as my adulthood. I'm a die hard fan of Dragon ball, which is totally dependent on the action and comedy. But there's very little of those two in this low budget piece of crap. The jokes are extremely childish and there were very few action scenes. but they weren't that great. They just lasted for about four minutes or so and then the horrible storyline continued. Characters just start popping out if nowhere and they have no introduction at all. Yamcha just pops out of somewhere near the end of the movie and falls for Bulma all of a sudden. I expected some crude humor centering around Kameshenin but there was none at all (He is a bit perverted though). The acting is awful! I expected a lot from Chow Yun Fat, but was disappointed. The only two people who tried to act were James Marsters who played Piccolo and Justin Chatwin who played the title role of Son Goku, But the movie is a worthless piece of crap seeking to destroy what Akira Toriyama established in Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. This is a disastrous movie and is surely to top the list of the worst movies of all time! Avoid this and watch the anime instead. The anime (cartoon to some) rocks and the movie is so bad that I'm still recovering from the horror."
squall_kay,"""Dragon Ball"" name tarnished with this spoof movie.",1/10,13 March 2009,"i went to watch this movie with very low expectation, guess what, i turns out, one of the lamest movie, 2nd to legend of chun-li. both movie can be considered as spoof movie like those ""meet the spartans"", ""superhero movie"".the movies don't have good storyline, disrupt the real dragon ball (comic & anime) storyline, really poor characters development, and the movie only have +/-85min running minutes - the storyline seems rushing. They describe Piccollo seems strong and dangerous, but the fight quick+lame+not entertaining at all.Piccollo seems really week when fight with Goku. to the director and producer, no need to make a sequel for this Dragon Ball: Evolution, you all only will tarnish the ""Dragon Ball"" name only.if really wanna do Dragon Ball movie, hire excellent director (Michael Bay, Peter Jackson, Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan, etc), reboot back the movie like Batman Begins do. last but not least, thank you Hollywood for making this awful movie and destroying ""Dragon Ball and Akira Toriyama's name"" and and finally make most of the fans, disappointed."
matt-skea,terrible piece of garbage,1/10,12 April 2009,"This movie made me so angry, I joined IMDb for the sole reason of writing this crappy review.This was the worst movie I have ever seen.I left the theater very, very depressed.Every single person in involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves.The acting was horrible, the dialogue sucked, the story was as stale and rehashed as... I don't know... day old hashbrowns? Look, either they put together a team that can do this movie justice, or they get the people that did FFVII Advent Children and Resident Evil: Extinction to do a CGI version.Bottom line, this movie was, from start to finish, DEPRESSING AS HELL. The original cartoon (especially the original Dragon Ball series) was incredibly funny and upbeat. I never saw Goku getting put down or picked on.This is just typical Hollywood thinking that if they water everything down for the lowest common denominator they'll generate the most revenue. Hopefully the next team to undertake a project of this magnitude will give it the RESPECT it deserves and not give us more D-list Hollywood GARBAGE."
elizabeth-12994,Not very good,1/10,1 July 2018,"I have never seen any of the TV series but, I thought that this movie wasn't very good. In my opinion, they kept repeating the same thing over and over, getting very annoying. The movie didn't really expand on the story line and didn't have very much about it. Unless they'd advanced on the story line, the movie shouldn't have been as long as it was because it just dragged on. Many people may disagree with me but that is just my opinion. I thought the movie did have potential and opportunities but it was almost like they'd turned down every chance they got to make it a movie worth seeing. Unfortunately, it is not a particularly great movie and I definitely wouldn't rush to see it again.

UkCad89,Are you kidding me?!,3/10,18 March 2009,"If your going to make a movie based on a very great series than at least put more time and effort into it. I think Dragon ball movies could be great, but if its rushed then don't even release in the first place. This movie is about 5% done, im not saying don't give it a watch, but you might find that if you download it to the computer skipping parts of the movie will become a common thing for you to do throughout, i found myself skipping to the fight scenes. I tried to watch the scenes with no fighting but they were just so boring, I think the acting was awful as well. I hope this movie gets put into the hands of real film makers, and that the next one is fully complete and can actually be as well done as the anime was all these years.

Shad_Critic,One of the worst movie I've seen,1/10,24 February 2015,"This movie doesn't deserve the name ""Dragonball"" at the first place. At first when I heard there was going to be a live action Dragonball movie, I thought it was going to be good but it didn't meet my expectations. The story was awfully bad that it didn't follow the original source material. Like when Goku never went to school but in the movie he did. Also, Mai works for Picollo but originally she works for Emperor Pilaf.The CGI was also bad. I mean almost everything on this movie is bad. This is why making a live action anime is impossible. But of course there are some good live action anime movies like Rurouni Kenshin and yes, Rurouni Kenshin Trilogy. Even now I still keep hearing news about a live action Ghost In The Shell movie which they say Scarlett Johansson will play as Motoko Kusanagi. Seems like a good choice but I'm not going to expect it's going to be good.In conclusion, don't waste your time watching this crap. Trust me, watching this is not worth it. Stick to the anime and you'll regret nothing."
ennieday09,As bad as I thought it was going to be...,1/10,25 September 2009,"In one of the FAQ's about this movie I read, ""They are pushing the release date back so they have more time to work on special effects so it won't have to compete with other movies coming out."" Did they mean compete for worst movie in history to have a budget that big??? They knew it was going to be bad so why make this stupid film? They have ruined the Dragonball franchise and all the actors in this movie should be ashamed to be in some dribble like this. NONE of the characters portrayed even close to the original characters from the series and I'm surprised this movie wasn't directed by Uwe Boll. Oh wait one more thing, if for some god awful reason there is going to be a sequel based on the after credits scene, I will never watch another movie associated with any of these actors, directors, producers, distributors or whatever. And why the hell would you put another scene during the credits? Because as soon as this piece of crap is over, people are gonna rush to get the hell out of the theater so obviously no one is gonna see the scene. Don't waste your time watching, renting or even taking up time in your life to pirate this movie online."
poeticexpression,Objective Dragonball: Evolution Review,1/10,19 April 2009,"http://artisticexpression.wordpress.com(SPOILERS) Act 1: The beginning – As the movie begins, we are told of a time 2000 years ago when Piccolo, and his disciple Oozaru attempted to conquer the Earth Wait what? Right off the bat I see a problem. Now, I understand that Dragonball: Evolution is an adaptation, and therefore is not meant to follow the storyline down to the last detail. But making the Oozaru Piccolo's disciple? I knew of this change beforehand, and it is precisely what turned me from full supporter, to somewhat of a skeptic. In the beginning we are introduced to Goku, standing atop wires and profusely sweating. Along with Goku, we meet Grandpa Gohan: Goku's grandfather and martial arts instructor. In this scene, Gohan is instructing Goku on the ways of Chi control. While suspended atop the wires, a brief sparring session ensues between the two. Ultimately culminating in what can be compared to sci-fi original cheapness. A flying, but clearly held up by wires, Goku prepares to deliver a powerful kick, but is countered by Gohan's Shadow Crane Strike. My gripe is not with Gohan's counter attack, but the horribly edited flying kick attempted by Goku. In all honesty, the multiple flying kicks delivered by Liu Kang to Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (A movie ten years Evolution's senior) were made much more convincingly.After the sparring session, Goku made his way to school on a bike. There he was met by a pack of bullies who crushed his bicycle, and mercilessly picked on him. Goku, attempting to contain his rage, refused to fight. Now I have no problem with the fact the director placed Goku in school. And I would've continued to have no issues had it not come off as a Spider Man ripoff. The entire school sequence was, for lack of a better word, corny. Such clichés as the bully (Fuller), and the beautiful girl (Chi Chi) who dates the bully then falls for the nerd (Goku) have been done to death (See Spider Man 1). The only decent part of the first 15 minutes was when Goku disposed of his bullies without touching them.Act 2: The Dragon balls – After Grandpa Gohan dies, Goku sets out on a quest to find Master Roshi and the Dragonballs. I don't remember much of the middle, thus can't properly critique, but I remember some and I'll delve into that. On their way to I forgot where, they (Goku, Master Roshi and Bulma) fall into a trap set by Yamcha, who in return for their freedom, wants I forgot what money I think. After spending a day in the trap, Roshi effortlessly jumps out and confronts Yamcha. Now, this has been said but it cannot be stressed enough. Before they fell victim to Yamcha's trick, Goku and the others were in a hurry to find the Dragon Balls before Piccolo. Sidetracked by Yamcha's trap, they wasted a day, but as we learned later, Roshi could have easily jumped out of the hole the moment they were caught. I could delve into the poor character development, and obviously rushed story even more, but why bother? Its been mercilessly picked apart by dozens of other reviewers already, so why beat a dead horse? Act 3: The final fight: Goku Vs Piccolo – Anti-Climactic is the only way to describe this. It could have been so much better. Its only saving grace was the awesome power blasts being hurled by both fighters, and the multiple punches exchanged while in the air. But the 4 –5 punches exchanged in aerial combat, and the chi blasts were pretty much the entire fight. Not even taking up more than 5 minutes of screen time. However, my biggest disappointment was in the Kamehameha wave. The Kamehameha was probably the movie's only chance to redeem itself for its shortcomings, a feat which it miserably failed. Justin Chatwin (Goku) gets into a modified Kamehameha position, fires it up, then he jumps up and kills Piccolo. Perhaps the choreographer wanted to remind us of how Goku killed King Piccolo in the original manga, but unfortunately, like the majority of the movie, it failed to appease the fans and satisfy casual viewers.The original Dragon Ball was a mix of comedy and martial arts, its live action counterpart on the other hand, failed to adequately deliver either. The scenes intended to make the audience laugh drew silence, and the action was tantamount to a Disney martial arts movie. As a stand-alone film for kids I'd say its okay. But as a Dragonball movie, it's an utter disgrace, disappointment and failure in all aspects.The Actors 1.) Justin Chatwin (Goku) Not a bad actor at all, just didn't seem to nail Goku as spot on as he could've.2.) James Marsters (King Piccolo) Definitely the best actor out of the bunch, and did the role of Piccolo justice. It's a pity he was not given more screen time. He gave piccolo an aura of badassness that is rarely seen in movies, or even cartoons. If a reboot of the DB movie is ever made, James Marsters must be kept as Piccolo.3.) Emmy Rossum (Bulma Briefs) She was OK as Bulma I guess, nothing spectacular. Apart from Piccolo and the power blasts, she was probably the best thing in the film. Eye candy I mean 4.) Chow-Yun Fat (Muten Roshi) He was pretty good, he probably did Roshi as good as can be done in a Live Action movie 5.) Joon Park (Yamcha) Yawn nothing special."
geniuskentyk-1,"A crappy movie, but it's fun",4/10,9 July 2010,"I went in to see Dragonball, not expecting much. The trailer already told me that the movie was gonna be very Americanized, have whack special effects, and a white Goku. Although it was exactly what I expected, the movie was still pretty fun. Everything was pretty lame, like the acting, the jokes, and basically all the characters. I guess the actor who played Goku got it right with the goofiness, but it still felt strange. All the actors were okay; they're weren't horrible like Street Fighter, but not ""great."" I felt that the actor that played Bulma the best out of the whole group. The actor for Yamcha was miss-casted; he sucked balls. It was weird that Cho Yun-Fat played Master Roshi and an older actor played Grandpa Gohan, when Roshi supposedly was Gohan's master, but whatever. Overall, the movie is just what you'd expect. The resolution and ""plot twist"" was kinda stupid, and was totally different from the Dragonball t.v. show. If the movie was at least 2 hours long (it was only 84 minutes, what a waste) the plot could've been better and stuff.

sundevilemily,One of the worst adaptions ever in the history of cinema,1/10,19 September 2017,"Dragonball has been around for 30 years now,it has become a cultural icon and one of the popular things just like Pokemon,Power Rangers,Yu- Gi-Oh!,etc.People who love Dragonball can make a better movie than the terrible movie Dragonball Evolution.The guy who plays as Goku Justin Chatwin seems like a miscast because his acting as Goku seems nothing like him.Th movie seems like it was trying to make a movie franchise out of the movie and change a lot from Dragonball. Like how Goku does not have a tail,Krillin is not the best friend of Goku because the movie made him an outcast,Bulma has one small streak of hair to confirm she is Bulma,Goku is madly in love with Chi-Chi even though in the show he doesn't know what being in love is like,and most of the characters and history in the movie is nothing like Dragonball.This movie is definitely on the list for worst movies ever and worst adaptions ever.

ocp836,I knew it was bad idea... But not this vortex of calamity,1/10,5 April 2009,"I wish to be very careful of what I want to say, and I want other people to hear me out.I believed this movie is a horrible excuse of an adaptation. I walked in, and walked out with a horrible migraine, it was horrifying to such an extent, the my rating was to go beyond zero. Why?Let me explain 1.Source Material-Goku in High school? What is that? 2.Dialogues were unimaginably clichéd 3.Fight scenes, poor choreography 4.Casting-Don't get me started-Goku being a Canadian, 5.Storyline-From start to finish, excluding the dragon balls itself and granting wishes. It was mangled to such a degree, that it was embarrassing. Every step of the way, I was able to predict the outcomes in every shape and form, and what happened I guessed all the scenes right.You know I wanted to cry,I mean I' am not a big fan of dragon ball now, but... when I was still a little kid... I loved that show along with other Japanese TV shows like the Kamen Riders series, anime and American cartoons. They are the very building blocks of my adolescence. Now you see, I love movies in different shapes and forms, and I never want to be biased, for you see this is my first review.But this...(sigh)I hope this movie never reaches the blockbuster mark, because it is an insult to Akira Toriyama's work. FOX, I think this movie was a complete disaster. If anyone see this review please let my voice out. If I can meet the ones responsible for the movie's atrocity, I will not be like most others who rant their lungs out. But rather I will sit down, civilized, shake my head, and say ""what is this?"" and silently walk away. I will not acknowledge this as a film, for it is not. Period."
rock_cool,Tried something different and heaven fell apart,3/10,19 April 2009,"""Tried something different and heaven fallen apart"" well the above statement is for the director, story writer and casting manager. i don't know theses guys personally but had to tell ya all they have seen their last work. such an insult to to great TV series.Let me start off with the story, i don't think the story writer has even seen the original series thus he tried something different, could have been a decent story if the original series had not been made, intact had they tried the same story with different character name no one in the whole world would have guessed that they are trying to make a movie on the Dragon ball series.Second is casting well only one comment please watch ""Master youshi"" and ""Yam cha"" character in the movie you will get the complete idea as what went wrong. though the actors playing the respective roles tried their level best but it is the physical appearance that just the edge off. you all will have to agree ""Yam cha"" as a cool dude and ""Master youshi"" as mid age bit chubby person just didn't sound like them Well the fault of the director lies in not able to cover up the above mentioned flaws. the special effects seems OK in the initial 30 min or so but that also fell part as the ultimate battle between ""Goku"" and ""Pikolo"" started. back ground music was kinda OK but just could not do justice with the background scores of original DB series.All in all i would say if they had not tried to use the name ""Dragon ball evolution"" the movie could have done better as except for the name, dragon ball factor and characters name nothing else is matching with the original series not even the characters relationships."
Quinoa1984,"probably better than it has any right to be, but it doesn't mean it's very ""good""",5/10,6 July 2010,"Dragonball: Evolution is like the toy that comes with the happy meal, and a pretty cheap one at that. It does what it needs to, but is far from what you could get for the little tyke at Toys R Us, and as long as it doesn't break down (which should be about a day or so) then it should be alright. The film is based on a long graphic novel series and a very long television show (not seen by me, though the parody ""Dragonball Z Abridged"" is one of the funnies things you may have not seen yet), and it can appeal to kids and um maybe young teens based on whether they've read the books or seen the show or not. If so, it will probably disappoint by not being totally faithful- not to mention half of the cast is white and not Asian (the villain Piccolo, if one can recognize him under lots of green make-up, is played by Buffy's James Marsters)- but if you haven't seen the show or books it will... probably disappoint as well.It's cliché in story and in action, it features those scenes we see in these movies and stories like when an old man or someone is about to die and the hero holds him in his arms and he declares something important before dying (or, of course, being noble enough to die with dignity). And of course the course of action as to who people are and what they'll do, like Roshi as the eccentric tutor to the young Luke Skywalker-type Goku (Chow Yun Fat and Justin Chatwin), and what the big final battle will entail. Luckily there are a few minor surprises, or just crazy bits of business like what Piccolo can make Goku do in the transformation-sense. And there are some hot girls to have the young boys in the audience go ""ooh"" to be sure, including a girl formerly on the Real World, if that means anything much.But yet, the movie isn't really hateable, despite what many would believe. It's not made with particular flair, but it doesn't disappoint the ways one might expect (currently another film with similar 'elements', such as mastering elements of water-fire-air-earth called The Last Airbender disappoints much more greatly on higher stakes). At worst its action is uninspired and some of the fights could use a little more 'humpf' to them - and there is a ""LOL"" moment to have when the two Asian girls are having a fight - and they look exactly the same! One perk I should mention is Chow Yun Fat, who knows better than anyone else in the film (perhaps since he's been in sillier works over the years) and knows how to chew scenery and have fun doing it. Any moment he's on screen the film comes alive in ways the other actors, at best delivering in competence, can't quite bring along."
Kevinator007,"Keep away, at least a few hundred metres away!",2/10,3 May 2009,"Yun-Fat Chow! He must be seriously thinking about sacking his agent. An actor of his calibre in a film which barely makes up for the pop corn. You would rack your brains trying to find positives for this film. But then again, I must have known just by looking at the posters. Why did I watch it then? Well, because I have been watching Dragonball anime years and years ago and I was utterly disappointed even beyond the cushion of low expectations I prepared myself with. Yes, bracing yourself before going to the pictures isn't going to help for that film. The special effects were fine - in the early 1990's. The plot didn't do remotely justice to the anime. The director must have been taking the p**s, because you cannot seriously try to make a good film and end up with this.Avoid at all cost.

gus_mta,I prefer the Chinese version.,1/10,10 April 2009,"When i was 10 i saw the Chinese live action version of dragon ball. it was an awful movie, it looked like if it had a budget of two thousand dollars or less. The acting was horrible and the special effects were pretty bad. It seemed like something that some fans would upload in youtube.The matter is that this movie had a budget of millions of dollars, and i still prefer the Chinese version.The problem with this movie is not the history, the problem is that it lacks of the essence of DB. I wouldn't be upset if just goku were more like a little innocent brave boy instead of a classic horny American teenager.

anyia14_00,I knew it.,1/10,10 May 2009,"Complete and utter garbage. A total insult to the anime (unfortunately, I haven't read the comic), but honestly what were they thinking?? When they first cast Justin Chatwin, I knew I already hated the movie, but then I figured I should put my prejudice aside and give the movie a chance.....what a mistake. It's a total joke and as I've been saying from day one...what were they thinking casting Caucasians in these roles. The graphics are very laughable. Bulma has one strand of blue hair and brown eyes. The screenplay is very poorly written. There was noting compelling Fox to make this movie. Then why put so much money into something made so half-heartedly?? And I could go on.

KineticSeoul,The director absolutely had no potential or the budget to make this film,3/10,21 October 2009,"I had very low expectations for this film and thought it would be lame but this was just ridiculous, almost painful to watch. Even 10 yrs will be rolling there eyes while watching this mess. Even if the title says ""Dragon Ball"" it seemed like the director didn't even watch any of the episodes of the original cartoon or even the manga. Also why is Goku a white guy? And to top it off there is hardly any fighting in this movie which ""Dragon Ball"" is notorious for and when there is a fight scene it's just dull with crap special effects, I mean the special effects aren't terrible but it was pretty bad. This is a film that everyone that hates ""Dragon Ball Z"" and just laugh at it and also at the fans, cause if you watch the movie before you check out the cartoon version, you will most definitely not even give the cartoon a try. It also probably cost a lot just to get the license to make this film from the cartoon, but the budget was way too low for this type of cartoon to film adaptation. If Micheal Bay made this film I think he could have done a better cause at least he had a bigger budget to work with, and that is a big diss to James Wong. This was a bad adaptation and a terrible script. I give this movie a 3 cause I seen worse and the look on Justin Chatwin was hysterical in every scene cause his impression is like ""you guys have got to be kidding me"" and kids under 10 can at least enjoy all the color and stupidity.3/10"
Movie-Holics-Anonymous,Even worst than I expected,1/10,23 March 2009,"I expected this movie to be pretty bad but this is movie is so terrible. Bad acting, bad story, an hour and twenty minute version of Dragonball?? They basically took the names of some of the characters from Dragonball and made their own story. Joon Park did an OK Yamcha but the rest of the cast was ridiculous. Chatwin was so corny, he was more cocky and serious than the real Goku, this movie makes me sad. Dragonball fans are going to see this regardless of what they see in the reviews, as I did because it is something new for Dragonball. But this is one of the worst cartoon/anime/game to film adaptations I've seen. Uwe Boll excluded, all his movies are ridiculously bad. If you are just someone who knows little about Dragonball and are interested in the anime, AVOID THIS FILM. If I knew nothing about the anime and saw this film I would probably never watch the anime, its a TERRIBLE adaptation. Heres hoping we can get a reboot in a few years, or maybe a Dragonball Z having nothing to do with this piece of garbage. Fox needs to stop."
juancpove,One of the most mediocre films in history ...,1/10,21 March 2009,"Since last year we have been receiving news, pictures, and trailers about this film and a lot of fans were disappointed 'cause the huge changes that both story and the characters were going to have in this production ... but the problem is much WORSE.In forums I've read people commenting that if this movie would have another title it would be a great movie. What a mistake. This film is so bad and so terrible that it doesn't matter its title or the character's names. How can I explain it?. The worst Power Ranger chapter is deeper and better than Dragonball Evolution. I'm very disappointed 'cause the FOX made this poor and stupid movie. I don't know how they approved it.Poor performance, a script without creativity, in fact, there's no reasons to watch it. I hope the FOX doesn't earn enough money with Dragonball Evolution in order to cancel possible sequels, but only the audience will say the last word.

pm_alan,Movie? Or anal cleanser?,1/10,10 July 2011,"Look, to those saying ""it's not supposed to be an exact copy of the anime series"", shut it. If you're going to put the NAME on the movie, then you have to do more than just take character names from the series and create your own story line.I also saw someone create a review who made a comment ""it's not supposed to be DBZ, it's just Dragonball."". Have you even seen Dragonball....EVER? Of course it's not DBZ, that would be stupid and make even less sense than the movie already does...but seriously, this movie doesn't follow a damn thing that any of the series depicted.I can't believe that a fellow ""DBZ fan"" ACTUALLY suggested I see this piece of garbage. I was literally stupified throughout the entire thing. I didn't think it was possible to actually feel PAIN from watching a movie. It doesn't matter if you compare this movie to the series or not, it was just plain awful. The casting was awful, the script for the movie was awful, the story line was awful, the action scenes and fight scenes were awful....just...awful.Please, PLEASE, if you are reading this and have not yet watched this ridiculous waste of time and money known as a ""movie"", HEED MY WARNING, it is unbearable, and painful. Thinking about it makes my body hurt, i'm not even kidding. Ugh, UGH, i've seen cheap, low budget horror films better than this. Has anyone seen the movie ""Squeel""? IT was better. I'm not sure I can even put my disgust for this movie into words, but I make this review in hopes that someone reads it, and avoids the urge to punch themselves straight in the face. UGH!"

sniktanailuj,There is nothing good about this movie.,1/10,17 April 2009,"This Movie was absolutely horrible. I can't put into words how awful the acting was, and the special effects were a joke. The story was impossible to follow for both those familiar and unfamiliar with the cartoon simply because it moved too quickly. The film was extremely painful to watch. I don't understand why Fox would let such a monstrosity into theaters.To put it blankly, it was unfit even for a straight to DVD film.In my opinion, this movie may have potential as a high school film festival entry. I would advise you all to think twice before you decide to spend your hard earned money to see this movie. By the way, when I stated that this movie was painful to watch, i meant it. Not just for Dragonball fan-boys either, the movie was literally painful to watch. I couldn't stop turning in my seat. Also, I'm not a fan-boy.

gabkoost,I am in shock!!,1/10,14 May 2010,"I am in shock! This movie is horrible. It was not a surprise because everyone told me so. Despite that, i rented a copy and waisted 70 minutes of my life. The directors of the movie and people who hire them should be baned from the industry. They didn't realize or care that Dragon Ball was, during more than a decade, the most successful anime. More than that, it is the most successful anime EVER! Here in Europe the legion of fans of this anime is simple to calculate. Just count how many people there is from 15 years old until 30. And then, a lot of older adults and even kids that are now discovering the great world of Dragon Ball.This movie had such potential and freedom in terms of plot, special effects, wardrobe and emotion that this result can be considered the biggest flop in cinema history. They should have taken their times like they did with Avatar. A great opportunity deserves a great effort.I guess that a few con mans just wanted to make a quick profit from fans all over the world and ended up ruining it for everybody. Despite all of that i will not criticize the actors. I feel sorry for them. They could do nothing with such bad orientation.I also hope to see someday a real movie of DB!"
severus_wrx,A disgrace to the TV-series..,1/10,3 May 2009,"I don't understand what Ben Ramsey tried to pull with this amateur student film. Why would you try and change the storyline when you just had to do pick the main ideas from those hundreds and hundreds of episodes from the series. In this movie besides the characters name and the perfect wish granting dragonballs i didn't see any other resemblance to the series, plus there are a lot of contradictions with the main story, like the end of the movie (Goku couldn't transform since he's tail was cut off) or the part that Goku used to save the world numerous times and never went to college and all that crap; with him being the most powerful person on earth i didn't expect to see him showing off at a party in this lame excuse of a movie. Since this is one of your biggest screw ups 20th Century Fox, please read the script next time you want to do an TV-series based movie. Just awful...

fish_cannot_carry_guns,"Simply put, a bad movie",2/10,9 April 2009,"Goku is a high school student. He's a bit of a loser, he gets picked on by bullies, and has trouble talking to girls (especially Chi-Chi, on whom he has a crush). However, Goku has a secret. He has these powers, which make him incredibly powerful in just about every way possible. He is an orphan, and lives with is grandfather, Gohan, who trains him to fight. But he warns Goku that he shouldn't use his powers to fight schoolyard bullies, only on the great powers of darkness that are inevitably going to show up fairly soon, or else people will get bored and leave the theatre. On his eighteenth birthday, he is given by his grandfather a mysterious spherical object called a Dragonball. There are only seven of these in existence, and anyone who collects all of them will be granted one single perfect wish (I assume that means one without any conditions. So is wishing for more wishes allowed?) So anyway, Goku is distracted from his school work by Chi-Chi. Later that day, she is having trouble opening up her electronic locker (the film is set in the near future, or a parallel universe, or something like that), so, in order to impress her, he uses his powers to open it for her. This does indeed impress her, and she invites him to a party she is having that night. However a group bullies shows up at the party, and call him names. Goku, not wishing to disobey his grandfather, but still wishing to cause these people as much pain as possible, gets into a fight with them, but instead of inflicting any blows, he merely dodges the attacks made against him so that his aggressors hurt themselves rather than him. This impresses Chi-Chi further, and they talk. You get the impression that they're about to almost kiss, however the actual plot (finally) kicks in, and Goku rushes back home to find his Gohan murdered by a green alien played by James Marsters, called Piccolo. He is after the Dragonball that Goku inherited that day, so he can use it for his own evil purposes.Sound familiar? Well, it should, because there is very little, if anything at all, that is original about Dragonball: Evolution. It begins as a generic high school drama filled with clichés we've all seen a million times before, and have no real desire to see again, especially in what is supposed to be an action film. Eventually, it becomes an adventure movie, as Goku teams up with a girl called Bulma, who wants to locate all the Dragonballs so that she can be famous; Yamcha, a thief who wants to harness their power to gain immense wealth; as well as Master Roshi, a perverted, middle-aged man whom Gohan, before dying in Goku's arms (just before, of course, the obligatory ""believe in yourself, and you can do anything"" speech) tells him to locate. I believe that Gohan and Roshi were friends, or something. I only walked out of the cinema about an hour ago, and already I am forgetting what exactly the movie is about. Yes, you guessed it, they're looking for the Dragonballs, before they fall into Piccolo's sinister hands. There's not really much else to talk about that concerns the film, to be honest. There is an adventure, but you've undoubtedly seen something like it many times before (all that's different is what they happen to be looking for). There's action, but it's poorly executed (especially after the recent Watchmen, which had a similar style of action; only it, as well as the movie itself, was executed in a far superior manner). There's also romance (between Goku and Chi-Chi, as well as Bulma and Yamcha), but it's so contrived that it's laughable (a romantic scene between the former two ended with a sarcastic round of applause from the audience, myself included). The scenes that are meant to be humorous are far less amusing than the ones that are trying to be serious.While I wouldn't consider myself a fan of either the manga or anime upon which Evolution is based, these are both far superior works to this movie, and definitely worth checking out.As for Dragonball: Evolution (in case you haven't already worked it out)as far as I'm concerned, it is a bad movie. However, I would actually recommend watching it, because much of it is unintentionally amusing, and it does give off a so-bad-it's-good-vibe,But still, a movie that's so bad it's good is still, well, bad."
beckegav,Might just be the worst live-action adaptation...,1/10,13 April 2021,"For the longest time I thought ""The Last
Airbender"" was the most insulting live action adaptation.They weirdly have a lot in common. But somehow the level of competency has plummeted even deeper! This is one of the worst looking films I've seen from a visual perspective. And the acting is an even further departure from the iconic anime characters they're portraying.This movie makes ""The Last Airbender"" and ""Death Note"" (2017) watchable, that pretty much says it all!

sree-howlett,I wish there was a 0 out of 10. Kids Matrix ? Come on !,1/10,11 October 2009,"I wish there was a ""0 out of 10"" option. If you are a fan of the legendary Dragonball you would probably know what I mean. Or if you are a movies-fan then let me put it to you in a more meaningful manner. This is a rape to the legend that is Dragonball. Why did the Japanese allow it to be made into a live action film still keeps me wondering. Even if you have the highest paid CGI studios, you cannot achieve GREATNESS that was DRAGONBALL. This is nothing compared to the original manga (comics) or anime series and anime movies.In the UK release of the DVD and BLU-RAY, the tagline or fun-line or punch-line says, ""THE KIDS MATRIX""Does anybody really know how hurtful that sounds ? Dragonball (comics and anime) came earlier! I'm a fan of the MATRIX, but where did all that influence come from ? ANIME! PURE Japanese ANIME! That's where film-makers refer from when they wish to create something fantastic. That's why MATRIX was fantastic. Now this movie DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION is far from pleasing any type of audiences. Except for kids who think this movie and the G.I.Joe Movie are ""dope""Stay away from this movie. Bad movie. Bad Twentieth Fox Century for ruining the legends of Dragonball, Hit-man, etc etc"
somnorosu2002,Entertainingly Stupid,4/10,23 July 2009,"I am not a fan, didn't even know what Dragonball was, until I Googled it after seeing the movie. But i am certain that if i was a fan, i would have been incredibly disappointed. Not only is the plot, the characters, the action, the decor, the costumes, the effects and even the music really bad, but they actually manage to screw up the obvious intentional humor every time.Even so, the movie did not bore or annoy me. It actually made me laugh, mainly at how bad it is, but still, it was entertaining to lose 2 hours with it on a stormy day with nothing else to do. Quoting from another person, you might really get a kick out of watching it while being hammered.

johnnymacbest,Lost in translation.,1/10,9 April 2009,"Hollywood has done it again. They tried to copy the comic-to-movie craze with their tried and tested anime/manga-to-movie craze. Guess what happened? NOTHING. In the case of box-office flop ""Speed Racer"", this film inevitably jumps the shark with everything that goes wrong when adapting manga or anime to the silver screen; Hollywoodizing the source material, character personalities, right down to their names. Obviously, Hollywood has serious cultural issues. What a shame because it's one of the best anime/manga's out there so if I were you, I'd watch the original Japanese series over this one. Nobody learned their lesson over ""Speed Racer"" and sadly in ""Dragonball Evolution"", which should have been titled ""Dragonball Devolution"". It's one of the worst films of 2009 and a strong contender for the Bottom 100.

MCMAYNERBERRY,A Good Idea But Poorly Executed,6/10,1 April 2009,"A young boy named Goku (Justin Chatwin) sets out upon his grandfather's dying request to find the great Master Roshi and gather all seven Dragon Balls (of which he has one) in order to prevent Piccolo from succeeding in his desire to use the Dragon Balls to take over the world. The movie itself wasn't all that bad but the direction and the cinementography was way off. Csting was so-so, Justin Chatwin being one of the main and so was Emmy Rossum. I was surprised to spot Ernie Hudson among the cast. So overall the movie passed my liking, being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February.

joel116,a new term has been invented; getting dragonballed,1/10,10 April 2009,"Since it's early debut, I've been expecting it to be mediocre, but not like this. I cringed each time dialogs were spoken, in between fight scenes(what little they had)and seeing the work put into the CG. I've never been raped before but I think I have a pretty good idea how it feels, and to celebrate this historical moment in cinema, I thought of a fitting term for daily use. Anything that is considered an extreme failure, like getting divorced losing a child or getting hit by a car all in the same day, would now be replaced by the word Dragonball. So today I've been dragonballed for 1 hour and a half, and nothing can erase the horrors I witnessed during that time. DON'T SEE THIS DRAGONBALL !!!! FOR GOD'S SAKE !!!!

Jay_Exiomo,In the name of the dragonball,4/10,10 April 2009,"""Dragonball"" in name only, ""Dragonball: Evolution"" feels less like the popular anime and manga series it was based on than a perfunctory ""Karate Kid"" knockoff that feels as lethargic as its local opening date (a Black Saturday). James Wong's (""Final Destination"") corny, albeit polished, quest movie tailored for the male preteen crowd drops much of its source's mythology in favor of juvenile kitsch that zips through its plot with the full awareness of its target audience's short attention span.For his 18th birthday Goku (Justin Chatwin) has been given by his grandfather and master Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) a dragonball, one of the seven orbs scattered all over the world that grants anyone who collects it all ""one perfect wish."" It turns out that Piccolo (James Marsters), an erstwhile imprisoned alien, has mysteriously escaped and is also after the balls to seek revenge on the Earth, where he was banished from 2,000 years ago when he planned to destroy it along with Oozaru (Ian Whyte). It's up to Goku to keep Piccolo and his femme aide Mai (Eriko) from finding the rest of the dragonballs and destroying the world (oooh!).The involvement of Stephen Chow as a producer all but indicates a cartoonish movie and its awareness of its source's daffy quality at least rightly fits in with its cast members gameness to not take everything seriously - as typified by Chow Yun-Fat's embarrassing turn as Master Roshi, Grandpa Gohan's former teacher and now sensei to Goku. Yet ""Dragonball: Evolution""'s greatest fault is perhaps its inability to gratify anyone, with fans of the series likely to cry foul with the liberal modifications done with the story and the characters; and everyone else realizing that it's an unexceptional fodder for a slow weekend."
dwigth,King Kong meet the power rangers in Dawson's creek the movie,1/10,2 April 2009,"Like all B-movies fan, i can say this the new Z-movie, not for Dragon ball Z or even Zombies content, this is the worst ever movie adaptation of a book or action movie ever made. Maybe the cast of the chars could be passed for all the people, including the fans, but the screen lines turn this down, all the people who expected to see a great kung fu, full of action and super powers movie get's a young comedy movie, with bad yokes and worst FX and fighting scenes(i have seen more action with the Star wars kid), in King Kong meet the power rangers in Dawson's creek the movie. The film Vision of James Wong, dig the grave for the most expected movie of the FOX, in screen we get, bad direction of the cameras, bad use of the scenarios, a poor makeup department, a deficient use of FX (i have seen better Kame-hame-has FX made by a boy of 12 years in you tube), and a lot of disappointing use of costumes (piccolo using a batman armor, with red pajamas and the red coat of his aunt), just missed to let some filming equipment visible, to make this the worst movie ever made."
toptenjesus,Are you kidding me?,1/10,6 June 2009,"As a kid I spent several years in Japan and even though I had no idea what was being said myself and everyone I knew was obsessed with all things Dragon Ball. Then I went to Korea and found the exact same thing. Hong Kong and China -- also HUGE Dragon Ball followings. Then I move back to the US and found that Dragon Ball had taken a foothold here as well.This is a billion dollar global property with a huge established fan base and all the elements there to convert those who don't know about it.WHY in the world would they spend all the time and money to put out this giant load of crap? This isn't Dragon Ball at all.Do you know what this movie was? This was when I was 5 years old and my parents took me to an air show because Spider Man was going to climb on the wings of a biplane as it flew over the crowd. This was going to be the greatest day of my life. Then we get there and ""Spider Man"" turns out to be some guy in jeans and a jacket with no mask or anything who walks on the wing of a biplane. NOT Spider Man. And this movie is NOT Dragon Ball.Did the people who put this movie out really just not want to make money? Because I'm pretty sure that's what happened. They said, 'Hey we have enough money already, let's just spend a lot and see how much money we can make this movie lose."" Garbage."
heretic826,"Literally, the worst movie I've ever seen",1/10,12 April 2009,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not just a lame fan boy who is all upset because Bulma doesn't have blue hair. And I'm also not a boring troll who will sit and trash any movie he can for fun. I happen to love the whole Dragon Ball saga, and I have since I was little, but I'm also a realist and know that things need to be changed for cinema.This movie, however, is a piece of crap on so many levels.For example, I'm also a big fan of Harry Potter books. I hate the 'Prisoner of Azkaban' due to so many liberties being taken with the film. However, after re-watching it, I still have to respect that it is a good, well-made film. 'Dragonball Evolution' is just straight-up terrible in every possible sense of the word.The ""story"" here is basically, a teenager named Goku is given a mystical Dragon Ball from his grandfather. After twenty minutes of bad teen dialogue, awkward stumbling through lines and the worst back story in history, Goku sets off to find Master Roshi to alert him that Lord Piccolo has returned.Now, some of the fight scenes are decent, most of them are not (a lot of unnecessary slow-motion). That scarcely makes up for the wooden, horrible acting on display. Justin Chatwin is probably the most un-emotional actor I've ever seen. I've never met a more unlikeable hero; in fact, I hated him. Anyone who knows Goku from the television series.. Could you imagine hating Goku? Lord Piccolo is also the worst cinematic villain in history, at no real fault of James Marsters. Piccolo was scarcely in the movie, and he did nothing. Also, the way he was introduced was basically.. ""We locked up Piccolo. He's back! Aw crap"" and that was it. Piccolo also has a random girl named Mai who is a shape shifter and does all of his bidding. So, the only thing this movie really stirs up is apathy, as I couldn't even force myself to care about any of the characters.All in all, if you are the type of person who likes to watch bad movies for their comedic value, this one is priceless. From a slow motion crying scene to the most predictably bad cheesy dialogue ever, this one has it all. To be fair, Chow Yun-Fat is pretty entertaining as Roshi. Oh, and there is no shortage of cleavage shots, for you guys out there.2/10 on a film scale 9.5/10 on an unintentional comedy scale"
DenaGee,Hollywood messed up the best anime of all time!,1/10,9 April 2009,"Dragon Ball evolution is an abomination to the history of live action anime! Dragon Ball series are the best anime of all time and what we see here is a total mess of a masterpiece! there is some nice special effect, famous and appreciated actors and actress but all the magic of dragon ball is everywhere but in this movie, Nothing is like the original, few peoples are missing and have nothing in common with the original dragon ball. This movie is more power-ranger like than what we enjoyed during our childhood, they do not deserve any money for this movie, if i could i would give it a minus 10. in fact i register here just to post this comment!!! Hollywood stay away from japan!!!

morphixx,Just a disgrace.,1/10,25 March 2009,"Anybody who is a fan of Dragonball will be extremely disappointed with this movie. Even if you aren't a fan, this movie is still just awful. The story has absolutely no structure, and does not even have the slightest resemblance to the series it is supposedly based off of.I watched this movie, and being a fan of Dragonball. It was painful, that's the only way I can describe it. The story is extremely cliché, and the plot and theme is less than mediocre.Being an avid fan of the series. It is hard for me to say this but, this movie is a 1/10. They did not follow the story of Dragonball, they simply took the Title and the Names of the characters.I can honestly say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Or it is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am shocked to hear they want to make it a trilogy.What a shame, and what a disappointment."
griffsta,"If you like Dragonball, do not see this movie.",1/10,22 March 2010,"If you have seen the original cartoon series, or DBZ, seeing this will hurt you. The story gets chopped up to fit in with the whole American typical high-school-teenager theme, and a lot of the original concepts get changed for reasons i can't think of except that James Wong thought ""well I've already ruined part of this, may as well go the whole way"". The only reason I didn't walk out of the cinema is because I paid to see it.Main points:-Goku's character is completely wrong, all goku wants to do is train and fight stronger enemies, and make friends... he does not care about being popular, or getting a girlfriend or any of that cr*p. Also the martial arts used are very basic. Lets finally mention, nimbus? power pole? no. -Oozaru is a complete failure. He should have been hundreds of times bigger. Also - lack of tail, full moon etc? Not just that but Goku cannot control his great ape state, let alone transform back. -Piccolo has no antennae.. also his back story is COMPLETELY wrong. -Grandpa Gohan's story part was all wrong. -Yamcha sucks. -Master Roshi was funny, and I've no problem with Yun Fat Chow but the role was really poorly cast. Also he has hair wtf?!Finally - THE KAMEHAMEHA DOES NOT HEAL PEOPLE!!! It would have blown a hole in his chest ffs.Wong, do not even think of making a sequel."
chido30,"I knew it was gonna suck, but expected something, anything for $100 million bucks!!!!!",1/10,7 May 2009,"Don't even know where to begin.... I've been reading some of the comments posted here, and I must agree with pretty much everything real fans like me have to say about it. I already lost 2 hours off my life (thank God I didn't pay to see that sh*tty movie), so at least I won't have to waste much more time bitching about every little detail about the hideousness that the movie was. I mean, c'mon!!!! Goku can't even take a bullet here??? He could not jump his ass out of that hole??? He likes girls??? I bet he even wacks off to Chi Chi. And what's the deal about the kame hame ha??? The real Goku learned it just by watching Master Roshi when he put out the fire from the castle. This one couldn't do it until chi chi taught him. The poses were all wrong. And the Oozaru transformation??? He needs an eclipse to transform, but not a tail??? And that was probably the dwarf version of the great ape. Why couldn't they have made a really cool fight with punches and kicks, just like they did in Matrix Revolutions??? I mean, the budget was almost the same and the effects shown in The Matrix Revolutions were a whole lot better than these, a movie made 6 freaking years before this hideousness!!! To the producers: Please, oh please, don't even try to make a sequel. If you don't need the money, donate it to a charity or something, don't break our hearts again."
akis91,Great disappointment,2/10,21 February 2010,"As a hardcore Dragonbaal fan as soon as I heard that there would be a movie I was really excited as I expected something great and something really unique due to the potential that Dragonball had in being turned into a movie. However soon after my hopes started crashing as the actors were announced and the first videos were out. Common Justin Chatwick as Goku? WTF? As the movie didn't come out in cinemas were I am i bought the DVD and I still had a little faith that this potentially huge franchise could not be ruined, however unfortunately my hopes were demolished and my fears became true. The great saga of Dragonball instead of becoming one of the biggest blockbusters of all time as it worths, it was turned to a cheap boring failure. Those people if they had any respect to Dragonball they shouldn't dare ruining it in this way. The plot was horrible and was far far away from the actual series, the acting as well as the choice of actors was even worse. This movie was so disappointing and boring that I actually had to start it over 5 times in order to manage to watch it without sleeping midway. And you know what's the worst part? They are going to make another one, with the same crew!! WTF?? Show some respect people, why are they doing this? Why the hell do they want to destroy our childhood dreams even more? I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except if you are a true hardcore Dragonball fan and you are really curious to see how someone could possibly destroy the enchanting world of Dragonball."
supertechrene,Disapionting. I'm a dragon ball fan and i think that there are many improvements to be made if a second is to be released.,1/10,21 March 2009,"First off i'll say that 2009 is looking like a bad year for movies.I've been watching dragon ball since I was like four and after watching this movie I had to wonder, did the director or script writers ever watch an actual dragon ball episode? I think that the movie would have made a bigger impact if they used the original story of dragon ball down to the teeth. They changed it by saying that piccolo was a saiyan not a namekian and goku was something else. Also humans made the dragon balls not namekians. I can live with goku being trained by some old guy then moving up to master Roshi and how he met Chi Chi(his wife to be). There are so many things about this movie that i cannot even put into this comment, it's heart breaking as a fan to see a movie like this. Inially i thought the idea of a drgaon ball movie with real people was a good idea i still think it is but if there is going to be a part2 then these steps must be taken:improve the drama and the excitement within the fights, use more dramatic music building up to an attack. the fights in this movie should have been more epic and almost equal on both sides. The attacks should be quicker more fast pace and more intense. As much we all like goku it would have better if he had gotten beaten up a few times. Change that goddam dragon please and make it's appearance more dramatic it's tail is surposed to cover the entire sky and it's not surposed to be some tiny lizard thingy and make it green with scales.In closing I would like to say the choice of actors was not bad if this movie is going to be redone then they should use the same actors. This movie was really nothing but a disgrace to the dragon ball world but i'm too big a fan to see the series go down like this."
starzhoney33,Total Frustration,1/10,25 March 2009,"This movie is an all-time disappointment! We have been waiting for years for the movie to happen. When the announcement was made to produce the movie at last, we, the avid Dragon Ball fans, were all tearing in excitement.Little did we know, we came out of the theatre after the movie preview full of resentment and grievance. To the true Dragon Ball comic fans out there, do not expect the story or characters to have major colleration to the original. Not only the story line twisted but character-play was utterly out of the way. Shenren the dragon, was really crappy. One glance at Master Roshi's flowery shirt put me off the dinner table for days. Give us back the perverted Roshi!! This movie needs a serious re-make to stay truthful to its origins and be answerable to the disappointed comic fans worldwide."
robert-1879,"Like Buying a Porche, Slashing the Tires, and plowing into a wall at a high rate of speed",1/10,13 April 2009,"God this movie was bad, don't get me wrong I wasn't expecting a lot but I was expecting at least something worth the 10 bucks i'll never get back, after watching all the series this movie made me wanna gouge my eyes out with a hot plastic spork. I honestly felt ashamed and dirty watching this.The worst part for me was when they started mixing in CRAP from Avatar: The Last Airbender. With the Kamahameha wave being the ultimate 'AIR BENDING' technique. And Piccolo being a Fire Bender using the Oozaru form of Goku as a slave.Only good thing in this movie was Bulma, Chi Chi, and that chick w/ Piccolo, Asian boobies! They didn't even show nimbus, the kame house, Yamcha had no scar, no tien, no krillin, GOKU Doesn't HAVE A TAIL BUT CAN TURN INTO OOZARU This movie sucked. Period. The End.Thank god at the end though I walked into Observe and Report and watching a naked dude get shot point blank made me feel better about myself"
blaube94,It had so much potential,2/10,24 November 2009,"This was probably the biggest disappointment in a film of my life. It would of easily rivaled other movies based off classic toys and TV shows if it had a better director and was less corny. All they had to do was make it pg-13 and they would have been able to take out all of the parts that you actually feel embarrassed to watch, and add fight scenes that were a little more graphic and realistic. The acting was a little shotty in places, but with a storyline this bad it would'nt matter who was in it. The worst part though was easily put on the director and producers. Whether it was the obviously fake backgrounds or the fact that they developed and showed how the characters were so badly. Overall they should try Dragonball Z again, but should put on a little bigger budget.

devildmg,what was that?,1/10,2 April 2009,"Really! what was that????? I saw all the Dragon ball sagas and this is just not it!!! the actors performance is bad!!! OK Bulma is really pretty, with all her hair in blue and maybe she could be part of it!!! but thats it... Goku is a midget, Roshi is just not Roshi, Piccolo? again, really?? and Goku as a monkey man? please... it all suck! the powers were sparkling particles with nothing to do with the real thing! did they even bother to see the series? the script is so bad that they must have been drunk when they wrote it... well i could spend more time saying bad things about the mov... i cant even call it a movie!! so i guess that says it all...awful..."
Darth-Furious,H O R R I B L E . Wretched. Deplorable. Tasteless...,1/10,28 May 2009,"I don't have the words. There was a kid about three rows up from us that threw his popcorn at the screen and walked out. Five minutes later, I was following him.This is the first movie I walked out on since Batman and Robin. Seriously. And no, I am not a Dragonball fan boy.I applaud the efforts of the dozens, sometimes hundreds of people who work in film. I adore you. Swear to Christ I do. I love to see film work. I love to do it. I love to feel the energy.Unfortunately, I'm rattled by this flick. How does something like this get a green light? Yet there are thousands of top notch specs sitting on someone's desk begging to be read by someone, anyone.This is not Dragon Ball in any sense of the word. Matter of fact, anybody involved in this thing should be smacked in the face. From Chow to Wong to Chatwin. And I like these guys for what they do. I sat through The Invisible just to see Chatwin do his thing. He's good. Chow Yun-Fat seems to find solace pissing on his own legacy. Anyone who seen The Killer knows this.And Ben... Ben Ramsey how dare you... I KNOW you know better than that. I know you have talent. Being one of the few to make it out of The Burgh you have a responsibility to do better. The Big Hit was goofy guilty pleasure fun but this... after all these years... this...I can't even...I'm done."
blued_one,Disappointing,3/10,15 April 2009,"The movie frustrates me. The fight scenes are boring and very short. I was expecting huge explosions (tight budget?-)). It would have been better to cut the scenes in school as I don't really remember much of Goku's life studying or probably I just missed them shown on TV. Goku's transformation into an ape was poorly done. I like Emmy Rossum as Bulma; she did well. Chatwin was alright. I think the movie should have to be re-shoot better fight scenes, extreme power for destructions (that is what Dragonball was known for). The movie failed to make me a part of it as I wasn't really seeing myself immersed and wanting to see more. My eyes riveted on the screen hoping to see more but the movie was just it has it can offer; it made me unhappy. I wont recommend this movie; this should have just been put on the shelves for TV/cable viewing.

TheWakingFalcoln,What Were They Trying To Do?,1/10,4 June 2009,"Hollywood isn't exactly the greatest at adapting pre-existing material to the big screen. It seems that almost every time they adapt a franchise, it goes something like this: ""Hey there--you know (insert franchise's name here)? You know the fantastic worlds you found there? The riveting plot? The adrenaline-pumping action? The characters that you loved? And the themes that resonated so clearly with so many people? Well we're gonna do something totally different and call it the same thing!"" ...If you take the approach I just described, Hollywood, how do you expect NOT to offend people? I personally don't understand what's so difficult about adapting a pre-existing franchise. I hope they learn their lesson some day, but they didn't learn it in time to save Dragon Ball from being smothered to within an inch of its life by way of the movie, ""Dragonbal: Evolution,"" which is probably one of the worst attempts at adapting a franchise I've ever seen...and easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I won't describe the plot because there are plenty of other places you can read about that if you want to, so I'd rather get straight to the essence of my review--the movie is marred by a script that was written without an ounce of regard to the themes of the original series...and this lack of respect trickles down into the production values, the special effects, the casting, the acting, and the directing. Dragon Ball is a story about a naive and borderline-stupid young boy named Goku who, in his naiveté, sees the world differently than most humans (in both a comical and endearing fashion). Despite his evident lack of intelligence, his pure heart gives him a clearer view on what it really means to be a friend, to be a father, to be a husband, to be a martial artist, and to be someone who will always fight for these values without regret. This confident, selfless, compassionate, and somewhat stupid boy's attitude changes the lives of the many people that he meets as a kid and as an adult in a story that is both moving and hilarious.So of course, what's the first thing ""Dragonball: Evolution"" has to do? Make him a socially awkward high school student who ""wants to get the girl."" They wanted to make Goku relatable, and that's the most critical flaw of the movie. Goku's not someone that people can relate to, he's someone who's supposed to be emulated. The theme that the writers wanted to tout was that this movie is a movie about ""having faith in who you are,"" which is the central struggle of the Goku in this movie. The Goku of the original series is someone with complete conviction in who he is, and it is this conviction that serves as the thematic device through which the story progresses. Had the movie kept this intact, I would not have minded some costume changes and crappy CGI, as long as they kept the essence intact. But, as I said earlier, Hollywood seems to have a phobia with being loyal to pre-existing franchises.As I said earlier, this lack of respect to the original message trickles down. The once-fearsome Lord Piccolo is reduced in this movie to a character with about four lines and no back-story. Muten Roshi is reduced to an over-acting ""you must learn, grasshopper"" martial arts master stereotype. The spectacular fight choreography of the original series is reduced to awkwardly-angled and hackneyed choreography where often you can't even tell what's going on. The fantastical world of the original series is reduced to a modern-day world completely devoid of t he imagination of the original. The series itself is reduced to a complete mockery of what it once stood for.Okay, let me back up a bit...I'm clearly a fan of the original series. Does this movie work for people who haven't seen the original series? Nope, unfortunately, it does not. Sure, the characters aren't loyal to the source material, but even newbies will recognize that the people they're watching in this movie are reduced to stock-type ""caricatures"" of other characters who have been done to death. The CGI and special effects leave much to be desired, there are plot holes everywhere, no back-stories are given to the characters...it's an unwatchable mess to newcomers and veterans alike.Hollywood...why? You had such a great opportunity in front of you. And you screwed this one up just like countless others. Just be loyal to what's already been done--it's not that hard."
fluffset,the low rating is sure from the die hard fans of Akira Torimaya's Dragonball!,6/10,5 November 2014,"Until 5/11/2014 its rating is 2.8. Looks like a really bad movie, or anyone can call it a trash movie. But, for me it's not really bad. Maybe the point of this movie is to get the money from a lot of Dragonball's fan all around the world, I bet everyone include my grandpa know what Dragonball is and my grandpa is really know about this manga, its the truth. If you watch it as a standalone movie and just forget about the ""adaptation"" word you will like this as some average American b-movie. I love Dragonball very much and have complete all its anime and manga and I know this is a bad-adaptation. I know too a lot of IMDb voter never watch this movie, they just give 1 star just because of its cast choice. The last thing is this movie still fail as a standalone because its story looks like rushing and really bad character development but everyone can still enjoy this as a fun movie. I think they need some mega-budget to make the Dragonball's world just like everyone dreamed for. 2.8 is too low.

SandroTheMaster,"This movie made me fall asleep two times, the third time I realized in horror why",1/10,22 July 2010,"Just to clarify: I've NEVER slept on a movie. Not even through some really bad drivel. Not even the unmistakeably awful. Not even through Titanic.But yes, the first time I saw this movie I fell asleep 20 minutes in and lost the whole showing. I figured it was because I was tired and had just spent a few too many hours awake, so I tried it again even though the little I could remember of watching in the multiplex seemed more like part of my nightmares.The second time I went to the cinema again (good lord I can't believed I paid this much to the people involved) and made sure to be wholly awaken to see the movie all the way through. 20 minutes in I realized (to my horror) that no, it wasn't a nightmare. What little I remembered of the movie really was what the filmmakers decided to commit to screen. Half hour in I was so bored I fell asleep again.Then now I have the DVD rental (it came free with other purchases, I still feel ripped-off) and promised myself I'd watch all the way through, so I drank nearly half liter of coffee and went on with it. By the time Goku fights Piccolo for the first time I realized no promise was worth it and just popped the damn thing out to watch something else.I'm not a fan of the Anime or Manga, so I don't feel exactly betrayed (ripped-off, conned and used, yes, but not betrayed), especially because I've always thought the story itself would never translate well at any degree into the big screen. But the Anime itself (at least the first series) had interesting fights and ideas. The fights in this one are easily the worst thing in the entire movie.The world feels like it is populated solely by the protagonists, and all interactions between characters don't only feel forced and contrived, but extremely unnatural to a point that not even blatantly reading the script and actively trying to act badly would accomplish. They must've made many, many shots in order to get a take horrid enough to put in the movie, because scenes that bad can't possibly be the product of a first try. The scene where Chichi discovers that Goku can manipulate Ki is unbelievably bad, but not in a funny way. It's not ""so bad it is good"", it goes beyond ""so bad it is horrible"". The story is poorly executed, the main protagonist is an unlikable blank sheet of a teen and by halfway through I wished so much that Piccolo was successful in his plan and blew up that stupid world that I just couldn't bear to know the movie would have a happy ending, and as such I didn't want to expose myself to it.Hollywood, you may have raised the bar showing that it can be done with Speed Racer, but Dragon Ball have completely stripped any doubts that Speed Racer was just a gigantic fluke way beyond your capabilities.(Gods, I still can't believe I've slept through a movie, or that what I saw in the screen wasn't a nightmare)"
alex06-1,Horrible movie... Horrible...,1/10,20 May 2009,"Being announced last year, it turns out that a live action Dragon Ball movie was soon to become a reality. Some were disgusted with the idea, some were excited, others were going to be patient and wait for the movie to come out and then judge it. I was under the third category... Then I saw the trailer.It became REALLY hard to reserve judgment after that. I could just smell the fail coming from a mile away, but I still had some faith for it. I was hoping that despite its bad trailer it could at least be decent. So last night I got the chance to see the movie through the use of a certain ""method"" that I don't think I should disclose on risk of getting in trouble with moderators.But to the point, now that I've seen this movie, I feel like I deserve to be publicly humiliated in ways you can't imagine for even thinking that the movie even looked remotely good. Simply put, this movie is HORRIBLE! So far holds my spot for ""Worst Movie of 2009,"" and really one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Worse than Lady in the Water, that says a lot. So why do I hate this movie so much? Well let's begin with the story.The story overall follows the basic idea of the Dragon Ball anime/manga, but takes way too many liberties. For starters, Goku is a teenager at the beginning, but that's okay. Just so long as Justin Chatwin is likable enough of a character, I'll be fine. I don't know if Justin has reached the right age to have fully establish who he is as an actor, but his rendition of Goku is about as likable as Aline in the 2005 movie Alone in the Dark. The first half hour of the movie shows him in high school, and it feels more like you're watching some bad direct to TV high school drama than a Dragon Ball movie. What's worse is that the movie is approximately 82 minutes long, and it wastes a perfectly good half hour on stupid high school drama! You think the worst is over? Oh that's the interesting thing about Dragon Ball Evolution. Just when you think it can't get any worse, it comes around and gets worse. Master Roshi is still a pervert, and Yun-Fat Chow does a pretty convincing interpretation of him... For the first minute or two. After that, he overacts so much that he gets annoying. Basically the movie tries to condense Krillin and Master Roshi into a single character, but the two combined just doesn't feel right.The decline goes further when we meet Yamcha. For some reason, somebody thought, ""Hey we've screwed over the fanboys already, let's unnecessarily make Yamcha some surfer dude!"" No joke.Onto Piccolo, I feel like I should lament on this wasted opportunity he was. A majority of the cast itself is just horrible, but James Marsters is simply perfect! His acting passes off like a live action interpretation of Piccolo should. But the sad fact is... HE ONLY HAS 16 LINES OF DIALOGUE THORUGHOUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE~!!!! This makes Piccolo like the GORT of the 2008 remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. He's probably the best thing the movie has to offer, but no one is going to notice him because he's so criminally underused.Anyway, onto the main confrontation itself, you'd think after a horrible series of minutes wasted, the movie would at least try and redeem itself at this point because final battles are always epic. But here's the really interesting thing. The final battle is the worst part of the movie if you can believe that. Goku does turn into his Great Ape form, and for some reason, Piccolo is somehow able to control him to get the dragon balls for him! SINCE WHEN DO SAIYANS SERVE THE NAMEKS?? Oh and it gets better, Goku turns back into his normal self, BUT HE DOES SO BY LEARNING THE LESSON THAT WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH SINCE WE WERE KIDS! ""Just be yourself and have faith in who you are! :)"" IF GOKU'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAIYAN THAT HIS PAST IMPLIES, THAT KIND OF SPEECH SHOULD BE WORTHLESS TO HIS GREAT APE FORM!!! And then Justin Chatwin pulls off possibly the worst finishing move in cinematic history, he defeats Piccolo with a simple Kamehameha wave. Even if it were that powerful, Justin sure doesn't make it feel that way, his acting just hits that low of a low.So overall, if you've seen the trailer of Dragon Ball Evolution, you've essentially seen the best the movie has to offer. The movie is every bit as bad, and worse. There's just no cult appeal to this piece of crap.Now about the budget, may I ask just where all that money went?! This movie looks and feels like something I'd watch on the Sci-Fi Channel for crying out loud! I bet this is how it worked, they paid Justin Chatwin $90 million to be in this movie and then used the other 10 to make some glorified Sci-Fi original picture. James Wong, if you're reading this, I'm sorry, I'm sure you've made some good movies prior to this, but this is just a disgrace. Not just to old time Dragon Ball fans who've wanted a live action interpretation, not just to movie enthusiasts. But rather to humanity in general.So overall, what would be my final thoughts on this movie? If you've always hated Dragon Ball and you've wanted to use something to bash against its fans, then go right ahead and see it. Otherwise, just don't touch this movie with 8,289,376,504,651½ mile pole. Save your money for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Terminator Salvation, G.I. Joe, those will all be far more worth your time and money than this ever will be."
tycho-snelder,Unbelievably awful,1/10,21 November 2009,"Remember how the Dragon Balls work? You gather all 7 of them, and then the Eternal Dragon Shenron appears, and you can make a wish. You got that? Good. Now, hold that thought, because it is the only Dragon Ball-related thing in this entire excuse for a movie.Before this movie even aired, the Internet Movie Database was already full of negative reviews, so I didn't expect much of it. But even then, I couldn't imagine how bad it would be.First, I have to say that I am definitely a fan of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. It is absolutely a true masterpiece, and it made me love Japanese animations. You'd think that with such a popular show, Hollywood would try to make it even better by adding a 3D-effect to it in a live-action movie. But what they did was exactly the opposite: absolutely NO effort was put into this movie at all! The story and especially the characters are hopelessly westernized and some people might take this as a good thing, but it really does the story no good.There are barely any similarities to the original series at all. Not even the name is correct. The original series' name was Dragon Ball, but here, they somehow decided to make one word for it. Further, the only things that relate the movie to the source material are the names of the characters and the concept of the Dragon Balls. That's right, only the names are the same, because the personalities are completely different. Bulma is just a trigger-happy rip-off of Lara Croft who falls in love with some hobo (Yamcha), Master Roshi isn't old at all and he lives in some apartment in the middle of a city, Mai is suddenly a henchman of Piccolo instead of Pilaf, and Piccolo is a lame enemy you'd expect in a Cartoon Network TV-series like Ben 10. But absolutely the worst example is Goku himself, the protagonist. At first, I didn't even know it was him! Where they high when they chose Justin Chatwin to be him (no offense, he was fine in War of the Worlds)? Oh, and Krillin? He didn't even appear.The most important thing this movie lacks is RESPECT. This movie is really disrespectful. Seriously, I couldn't imagine what they were thinking when they made this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if James Wong made this movie just to make the entire series look stupid. It's like they put the original plot in their mouth, chewed it for a minute, swallowed and then threw it up. The result: I wouldn't even call it a Dragon Ball movie. It's rather a pathetic fusion of High School Musical and The Incredible Hulk. I can describe this movie in one simple word: DISGUSTING! This movie is just an insult to Akira Toriyama and DB and DBZ fans all around the globe. This movie didn't make me sad, it made me angry. I have started an IMDb account just to post this review. Hopefully, that says enough."
jeffberta,"Almost unwatchable, which makes it comically watchable",1/10,12 April 2009,"Firstly, this movie is everything it could have been: a ridiculous, cliché, poorly acted, completely nonsensical lump of a movie. The dialogue is stolen from every hero movie in existence, the acting is completely transparent and downright bad, the plot goes so fast and has no sensible path that it fails totally, the special effects are fairly boring, and the only good thing to say about it is that Chow Yun Fat is marginally entertaining.Secondly, that's why I enjoyed it. This movie falls under the category of ""so bad it's funny"" genre. For anyone who has seen the anime, many of you know that Dragonball is the basis for much of the things Americans hate about anime. The dialogue is mundane, the characters look like creatures from some other dimension, and the plot makes utterly no sense. No one ever seems to learn anything valuable, nor do their motivations seem genuine. The characters simply exist to provide a moment of entertainment, which they normally fail to do. And this is why people watch it: Dragonball is completely adept at being inept.In reality, I think that this movie actually intends to poke fun at anime and itself with how horrible it is. No one could take Dragonball into a movie and have it make any sense. Going into the movie, if you keep that in mind and know that it will be an hour and a half of pure stupidity, you might enjoy yourself. I certainly did. Don't take it seriously, enjoy the special effects, and don't think too hard."
amsprich,"When people ask for proof God doesn't exist, I direct them to this movie",1/10,22 January 2019,"Were there a God I'd like to think he wouldn't make people this dumb.This just the absolute worst movie ever made and I'm still pissed off about it 10 years later.The only movie worse than this is Transformers the last knight.I can't believe I can't rate this a 0.What's funny is the people that rated this 2-6 also hatred it they're just too nice to give it what it deserves. I clicked to read into the reviews cause I couldn't understand why anyone would rate this higher than the lowest possible rating.I doubt anyone even watched one episode as over half the names are pronounced incorrectly.I agree with folks saying you don't have to be a dbz fan to hate this movie. Fan or no fan, this was a terrible movie."

dorado_germin53,Dragonball (Emo)lution,1/10,13 April 2009,"Well... I've been a fan of dragon ball since i was a kid and to be sincere, THIS MOVIE WAS A (DISASTER OF CATASTROPHIC PROPORTIONS)OH MY GOD.!!!!WHAT WERE THEY THINKING.!!!!!!!

FOX YOU HAVE RUINED ALL MY CHILDHOOD MEMORIES. why..??? why did u guys made a movie like this..!!!! don't u have any respect for the fans, do you????? After watching this movie now i realize that there's nothing in common with the actual anime, only some of the characters names and the dragon balls.

TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,An Objective Review: Messy and underwhelming BUT not quite as bad as reviews make it out to be. Fans will hate it. Non-fans will probably be able to at least stomach it.,4/10,13 December 2014,"(An Important Note: I am not a hardcore ""Dragonball"" or ""DBZ"" fan. I'm only vaguely familiar with the storyline of the franchise, and could probably count the number of episodes of the animes I've seen on my fingers. I am merely writing this review as an open critique of the film based on its own merits and qualities, without comparison to the anime, manga or other preceding content it was inspired by. A film, even an adaptation, should be able to be judged on its own right, without necessarily having to match or perfectly adapt it's source material. Hence the words ""adaptation"" and ""based on"" being used instead of ""directly translated from."")So... yeah. ""Dragonball: Evolution."" This film... happened. (I suppose that's the best word to describe it.)It barely broke even with its box-office numbers. It was a critical disappointment. And it was absolutely and mercilessly crucified and torn apart by fans of the source material manga and anime. Almost a universally panned (and then subsequently ignored) film, with only the rare supporter.But does it really deserve the near-universal hatred? It is really that objectively bad as a stand-alone film? Is it really only worth the current 2 out of 10 user-average here on IMDb?I don't think so. Oh, don't get me wrong. It's still a ""pretty bad"" movie. But I don't think I could objectively call it ""terrible"", ""awful"" or even ""patricularly bad."" This is just a plain, basic, underwhelming film that, while having a few cute moments, was condemned more due to its highly-regarded source materials than due to its own flaws.The film follows a teen-aged martial-artist named Goku (Justin Chatwin), who is sent on a quest to recover the ""Dragonballs""- mystical spheres that can grant a ""perfect wish."" He will need to collect these in order to stop the dark plans of the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters). Along the way, Goku also meets new allies who help him on his quest, including Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat), Bulma (Emmy Rossum), Chi-Chi (Jamie Chung) and Yamcha. (Joon Park)And I will give credit where it is due. I think all of the actors tried their hardest, and some were actually quite good. Yun-Fat and Marsters coming off as the best, of course, and both quite excellent in their roles. But I also found Rossum and Park very good in their roles, and they actually were my favorite actors in terms of casting. Both had a charm, and were clearly having some fun with the material. (Particularly Park, who seemed to really embrace the fact he was playing an anime-inspired character.)And there were a few sequences in the film that were genuinely fun, and had some honest thrills and laughs. They may not have been as numerous as I would have liked, but the film definitely had its moments where it gelled together quite well.That being said, this is still a flawed, messy movie. Ben Ramsey's script is very basic and cliché, and has its share of bland characterizations and plotting, which felt unnatural at times.And direction courtesy of James Wong (who has had some strong success with work on ""The X-Files"", ""American Horror Story"" and the underrated ""Willard"" remake) is a mixed-bag. While some sequences are fun and fast, others feel patchy and under-developed. And oh boy do I have to question his strange mis-uses of slow-motion photography.Still, I don't think these shortcomings really warrant the absoluteness of the hate this movie receives on a regular basis. Yes, it may not be good... and it's definitely bad at times... but not to the extent of the atrocious ratings it's damned with by many people here. And while I can understand fans of the source material having a degree of anger or loathing due to this evidently not being a good adaptation... I think it should be judged more as a stand-alone work. And as a stand- alone film... it's definitely a bit better than it is made out to be.I will give ""Dragonball: Evolution"" an under-average (but not terrible) 4 out of 10. People who are open-minded enough not to judge it based on its source material might wanna give it a shot. And people unfamiliar with the source material are very likely to be a bit more welcoming to its faults, whether or not they particularly enjoy it. (Simply because they won't have the ""disappointment"" factor that many fans did have.)"
sanctuz_747,This movie is sad,4/10,25 March 2009,"1. Goku is a western dude. 2. Bulma is not blonde bu brunette. 3. Kamehameha is like dusty colourful wind. 4. Master Roshi is played by Chow Yun Fat and has no:GlassesThick beardTurtle back 5. Piccolo's face is abnormal since the ear is not at the right place. 6. The turnament is like in a school gym, not in the outdoors in the comic. 7. Goku becomes romantic not like the truth. 8. Contains almost no similarity in story to the comic book. 9. The island where Roshi lives is sad. Its like an island in the middle of apartement construction!!!! So, in spite of surrounded by the sea, its surrounded by construction side of apartements called The Pazuo 10. Everything I commented on is compared to the comic book."
santoshpc,Please for god sake don't watch this movie!,1/10,1 May 2009,"I just finished watching this movie and I have to say WHAT A DISASTER!!! I am very disappointed and this does not happen often, I am actually frustrated.The characters don't look anything like their cartoon counterparts and it seems to be blatantly obvious that very little, if any, effort was taken to rectify this. To lay more emphasis on my previous statement let me give you one example, Yamcha's most distinguishing or noticeable facial characteristic, the scar was missing.The writers have done a pathetic job, I seriously doubt if they have even seen the anime and I would like to summarize the director's role with just 2 words 'utterly disgraceful'. The storyline is a joke (not the funny kind either). The fight sequences were just lame and the worst part is that, it seems that nobody took the little effort required to make this movie even bearable.As a dragon ball z fan, I have to say that I actually consider this movie to be nothing short of a disgrace to the dragon ball series. I still can't believe that someone is even willing to put their name on this train wreck.If you are planning to watch this movie or due to sheer curiosity are thinking ""exactly how bad can it be?"". Take my word for it, expect the worst and it still won't reach your expectations.As I said before, this movie can be summarized as ""A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY""."
dahanjunior,What Was that ?,1/10,16 April 2009,"I am asking the question because I seriously wonder who could have thought that releasing this could be a good idea. OK, so people that actually liked the movie said that ""an adaptation doesn't have to be sticking to the story"". Here is what is common between the books and the movie : the names... where is the universe, where is the atmosphere, so unique, of dragon ball ? Where is the candidness of goku, where is the shyness of Chi Chi or Yamcha ? I heard that James Wong wanted to make a ""realistic movie"", When it is the unrealisticness of the universe that defines the books, as well as the series. I could go on for hours listing all the incredible tortures that were shown to my eyes, I will only say the biggest, that is, the ""cloning"" of Chi Chi. Releasing this isn't just hard, at this point it is disrespectful. I will just add that, even forgetting the story, this is the poorest movie I have ever seen."
Killa42,Some pros and some cons...,5/10,3 June 2009,"First, here are most things wrong with this movie: Let's start with Justin Chatwin this guy is a born teen idol. I could see all the little teenage girls screaming his name and chasing him like how back in the day they chased the New Kids on the Block. How does this make him Goku? It doesn't. He really did try his best to play Goku, and for that I won't degrade the guy he just isn't Goku not young Goku or any other Goku for that matter. If they were casting this fellow to get teenage girls to watch the movie: than their heads were in the wrong place. They should have been thinking about the millions upon millions of fans when deciding who to cast.Next, Chi Chi. She was written too soft. This was not Jamie Chung's fault this was the writing. Chi Chi was way more aggressive than this soft girl that knew how to fight. Until the very end, no spark in her. And even then the spark wasn't that bright.Moving on to the rating: PG? Really? What made these people think that this would draw a crowd? I started watching Dragon Ball in the late 90s when it first hit the US there are millions of others just like me, so what's the point in making it PG? I'm not saying make the thing R but they could have shot for higher! Next the writing: The dialogue sounded like a soapbox sketch that some lamebrain threw together in a month. Enough said about that.Then there was Yun-Fat Chow as Roshi I know they were thinking: He was in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but Roshi is old. Even in early Dragon Ball he is old. He is supposed to be Old Gohan's mentor Yun-Fat was half the guys age! They should have casted someone else. It isn't like Hollywood is running out of old Asian dudes just because Victor Wong and Pat Morita are dead.Lastly, someone please tell those lame brain writers of this film that the dragon freaking talks! And where were the other characters from Dragon Ball: like the blonde chick with a machine gun? Okay the pros: Cinematography shows what they spent their money on.The fights without Justin Chatwin were really neat as well.Emmy Rossum until she stepped into this movie: I thought it was going to completely suck. She really studied Bulma's character. She plays her exactly right and hopefully gets more acting opportunities in the future. That about wraps it up.Oh and please as a favor If any of you ever meet Ben Ramsey (the writer of this movie) please punch him in the stomach for me. Then say, ""You know why!"""
xamtaro,"And you think talking pigs, long draggy fights and constipated monologues would make this better?",5/10,16 August 2009,"Fans hated it, critics tore it apart, casual viewers like me got a good laugh. Originally i gave this movie a 2/10. But that was before I went and read the original Dragonball manga which this is based on. For example, the cheesy corny humor and lighthearted tone that so many people criticized in this movie was actually very common(and a lot more over-the-top) in the manga. I mean, Goku appears in the very first chapter of the manga, buck naked with his balls swinging in the wind, trying to catch fish with his tail. If that is not a sign of the corniness to follow i don't know what is.People tend to have a selective memory when it comes to the dragonball franchise. They only remember the cool fights and action but tend to forget the laughable script, stupid jokes and the overall absurdity of the setting, story and characters.(all of which made its way into this movie)Another thing i don't get is this. Why do people keep blaming Hollywood for this ""travesty of a movie""? The only thing ""Hollywood"" ever did for this movie was provide the funding. What the movie turns out to be is affected by the producers. In this case, the blame should fall on Hong Kong producer Stephan Chow. Now if 20th Century fox had given this show to an action sci/fi movie producer instead of a guy famous for over-the-top comedy movies, results could have turned out different.From the get go, one would know to expect a bad film. For a film based on a fantasy/science fiction adventure, the producer who specializes in comedy movies(Stephan Chow) could not have assembled a more mis-matched and inexperienced creative team. Neither the director, writer, or co-producer has worked on a good sci-fi or fantasy movie. Some of Chow's creative decisions just as questionable as his creative team. It is difficult to balance pleasing the fanbase and not alienating the casual movie goer and I can accept that he decided to make this film more appealing to newcomers by giving it a more realistic feel. Gone are the many outrageous elements like the weird talking animals, convoluted back-story, Goku's monkey tail and characters with outrageous hair. Goku himself has been changed from a neophyte from some temple in ""a far away enchanted land"" to a socially inept teenage student and i do not blame them for doing so.Live action adaptations that stuck too close to the outrageous elements of their source material, like Speed Racer, bombed at the box office while the ones that got realistic make-overs like Transformers, did extremely well even though the story and characters were so very different from the cartoon it was based on. Hence i do not blame Stephan Chow for trying to set a more realistic tone for the movie.But then he had to keep the EVEN MORE OUTRAGEOUS elements like the futuristic cities and vehicles, alien races, the corny humor, the special Ki Powers and not to mention the oh-so-stupid names like ""Bulma Briefs""(a brand of underwear maybe?), ""Yamcha""(which means ""to drink tea"") and ""ChiChi""(which is an adjective for ""trendy"" or ""chic"").On the technical side, this movie is definitely not the worst there is. For one thing, some the characters are huge improvements over the originals. Bulma is no longer the nagging, temperamental irritant like in the anime, but is now a butt-kicking gunslinger. Roshi still keeps his ""perverted old man"" stereotype but thankfully that is not over-played like in the anime. The acting is OK but it is no better than that in old Saturday morning cartoons.One element that they could have kept from the anime and manga would have been the long, plodding story and the extended fights that stretched over multiple episodes. Despite its flaws, the stretched story allowed the characters in the anime to be fully fleshed out and help to explain the sometimes confusing plot. However, the movie is a complete mess; truncated and rushed, clocking at only 88 minutes with no time whatsoever for full character development or story build-up. There is the underlying theme of self-awareness and identity but thanks to the truncated nature of the show, it is never fully explored.The story zips from locale to locale at breakneck pace, characters are picked up along the way and half-baked plot devices are thrown about. There is no sense of when or where the scenes take place. Halfway into the story, even the creative team seems to have given up at telling a story and just want to move things along into the final ""epic"" fight.One can argue that the creative team was being very faithful to the anime to the point of bringing its faults onto the big screen. For one thing, the script and dialog is no better than that featured in the dragonball anime. But i must applaud them for keeping the style of the battle scenes from the anime. For example in the final duel, Goku and Piccolo stand around and throw power balls at each other which result in blowing up much of the background props. Then they end up hovering in the air and, guess what, CHARGIN' UP THEIR POWER(!!) before letting fly with bigger fireballs at each other culminating in massive explosion. No doubt people would bash this movie to no end without remembering that compared to the dragonball movie made in China and the other made in Korea, this is actually quite good. Casual movie goers would be put off by the absurd elements, rushed story and cartoony nature of the movie.Fans would hate this for its lack of adherence to the source material. I guess they think talking pigs, a kid with a monkey tail, long draggy fights and constipated monologues would make for a better movie?"
gib_sephiroth,DB movie,1/10,3 May 2009,"Everything said above form this film is absolutely right, it is a disgrace to everything related to dragon ball in fact the only thing resembling to DB is the names of the characters. I really hated this movie and they made everything wrong, its a shame as this is one of the best animes around and has been for ages, its games and everything related to DB can be confirmed by the amount of years its been going and ppl especially fans will never go tired of it. This movie has potential to be on the top of comic movies but they really messed it up. If u gonna make a movie of something huge never divert form the story line and if u going to make it like the new DB online game 216 years in the future but do not use the original cast and mess it up. don't get me started on everything that went wrong coz its everything only the names as i said at the start. Fox should be ashamed of what they have done, and everyone who went with it. I really hope they make a proper version of this as it would make millions, just look at the amount of fans connected to this franchise."
walty_blue_31,Not Even Dragonball!,1/10,21 April 2009,"When i was a kid, Dragonball was the best. I would stay up late at night regardless if i was going to school or not, just to see Goku whoop some baddies. Goku was and still is a hero to many fans. I know people who have all the movies and all the games. Dragonball just owns.When i heard that a Dragonball movie was going to come out. I got pretty exited. Some people told me, ""They are going to mess it up watch!""But i did not believe. I thought. ""No way. Dragonball is to Awesome to be destroyed.""But i was wrong. Once i saw the trailer i got scared. It looked so dumb and nothing like the anime. Its kinda sad really. I wonder if they actually thought this movie would be the talk of the year. ITS TRASH!They didn't even get Goku's hair right. COME ON! Every DB fan can recognize Goku's hair no matter what. You can show it on the screen when you are watching the Simpson's for just a tenth of a second and DB fans will see it.He never pictured Chi chi with a strawberry. He used to get her mad.(Remember when Gohan went Super Sayian and Chi Chi flamed Goku because she thought Goku dyed Gohan's hair yellow.)DB is a big part of a lot of people's childhood. Now all us DB fans have just been slapped in the face and blown away by a Kamehameha, and trust me, it hurts.I hope they remake this. And apologize for this garbage."
perfectjohn,Rubbish,1/10,10 April 2009,"I can not believe Hollywood even decided to make a live action of this movie to begin with. The cast do not do justice to the animation. Why cast a white person to be Japanese?!? That's extremely presumptuous.This is also one of those movies where it's solely about special effects. No real story and lack of character development. I loved the animation and for them to rip the story apart is greatly disappointing. I nearly fell asleep watching this junk. Save your time and money and go buy the animated series instead.Hollywood clearly ran out of ideas recently and are looking to profit from any idea. Highly disappointed by this movie - avoid!

rdelgado-6,Really Disappointed....!!!,1/10,20 April 2009,I am a DB fan.. and this my friends was not what I expected... I won't even comment on the movie that is how sorry it was... Instead. I will give you guys on what I thought the movie should have been...It should have started with an Old Man voice explaining the origin of goku..They should have show the him coming to earth as a baby.. with the tail.. Gohan raising him and training him..They should have had a I don't know a 8 year old actor.. to play goku for about an hour into the film.. they should have had krillin.. man I will stop here because there are so many should haves.. that I bet any of us True DB Fans could have directed this film way better then it was. I just can't believe they messed this up so much.. what where these people thinking...
malaciuca_tgv,They should have called it Dragonball Involution,1/10,22 March 2009,"This is my first comment on IMDb and i am making it because this movie it really sucks. For all the fans (or those who like DB series or you just know about DB world ): Please do not watch it on the big screens just wait for it to came for free on the internet, please do not pay for this crap so they can loose money and never make another trash like this. Now i will explain why this movie deserve to be hated!!!!First of all because they put the name Dragonball in the movie name (DragonBall Evolution)so we all expect that this movie will be a live adaptation of the manga and the series of Dragonball( not DBZ=Dragonball Z) and is not man, they say that this movie is something new ( because they have changed to much the original story) Now what happened: First they have changed the place of the action from the real story, in the manga all is happening in a fantastic future (or past) but in the movie all is happening in our world and time but a little futuristic . IS like making the action from Lord of the rings to happen in our time and bring Star Wars to Earth.Why they couldn't keep the place i don't get it.From the beginning they are making one of the most stupid mistakes saying that the Dragonballs where made by some bald ancient priest guys WTF?.( They where made by namekian so don't screw this guys)Of course some say that this is an adaptation and we should think of this movie like a new Dragonball but that is just a lame excuse for this movie. Most of us want to see the real Dragonball story ( with some changes because this is an adaptation)and not a sick adaption teen high school movie. Only the names of the characters are from Dragonball the rest is just pure American high school movie plus some prophecy plot thing that has nothing to do with Dragonball , the characters have nothing to do with the ones from the manga or the animated series :Goku is a weak high school kid and he don't have the innocence and the real trust in his powers (and he goes to school) and we do not have Krillin who is the best friend of Goku , how can u miss that, Tien Shinhan is missing to , Bulma and CHi CHi are somehow OK and Master Roshi ( with the exception that hi's not bald and don't have the turtle shell on his back and those super glasses) but then again we (the ones who know the DB manga and series)want to see those characters from the series brought to life , and what about King Piccolo ( if that is King Piccolo, i hope it is and not the Piccolo from DBZ) damn he was f***** up real bad man, hi's turned in to a weakling. OK they couldn't kept a lot of stuff from the manga and animated series but the acting was week and the actors seemed to have trouble identifying themselves with the characters (that happened probably because they worked with a stupid scenario or maybe they didn't read any volume from manga or watched any Dragonball episode). The visual effects are weak and lame. All dialogs are very superficial like they where saying those lines for the first time with no rehearsal. And for all those who say that this movie rocks please go f*** yourselves . And by the way in Dragonball world the tournament was a very important motive for the characters to improve they'r fighting skills and abilities ,in the movie DragonBall Evolution the tournament is almost nonexistent.Because this movie contains the name of Dragonball and the names of the characters from Dragonball it cannot be seen like a stand alone movie or just a simple action movie, so stop saying stupid things like:"" give it a chance because it's Dragonball after all and u are a true fan"" - is not man , this is not Dragonball, if u are a fan of Dragonball then u will hate this crap and those who made this movie. or "" if u watch this like a simple action movie then it will be OK""- this is not a simple action movie this contains the name Dragonball in it so is not that simple man, this should be a Dragonball movie not a simple action movie.There are many others things to say about this movie but i don't have the space to write them here.In conclusion i hope they don't make to much money with this one so they not attempt to make a part2 for this movie. 1 out 10 from me and many others who are angry because of this crap!!!!!Best watch Kung Fu Hustle then this crap!!!"
dallasrbriggs,"If this is evolution, Darwin was so so so wrong.",1/10,10 May 2012,"Blegh. Even if you haven't seen Dragonball before this isn't a good movie. It's just awful. The energy blasts should have been like Iron Man's. These ""air bending"" things they do are just terrible. It's not energy, it's stupid. And I don't recall Goku being a highschooler, or Chi Chi throwing parties, or either of them being really stupid. The characters don't act anything like their anime counterparts. Master Roshi is young, clean shaven, and has hair. It's weird. And Piccolo's antennae? They have receded into his head. He's not a namekian, another thing the movie got wrong. He's not a ""namek"", he's a namekian. A namek is a planet. I hate everyone involved with this film."
ashleymalpas,Hollywood destroys another classic,1/10,29 April 2009,"It is not possible in 1,000 words to explain just how bad this film is, it seems they've completely not bothered to actually do any research into Dragonball (or its sequels Z and GT). This film completely ignores the source material, and is Dragonball in name only (apart from character names as well).Whoever wrote the story for this film deserves less respect than Uwe Boll, and thats saying something.If you're a fan of Dragonball, Z or GT, I recommend not to see this horrendous steaming pile of crap. Next time Hollywood, instead of a cheap unrelated cash in, try making something decent and stay true to its roots.

Renji206-1,What i think of this movie,1/10,21 March 2009,"Where do i start with the problems with this...I'm a hardcore Dragonball Z fan.1.When Goku is 18 he's fighting Raditz and Grandpa Gohan has been dead for 10 Years.2. Goku has always enjoyed fighting strong opponents.3.Goku never went to school, he knew nothing of the outside world before meeting Bulma.4. Piccolo didn't kill Grandpa Gohan, Grandpa Gohan didn't even know who he was.5. Goku needed a tail to transform to the Ozaru during a full moon, not during an eclipse.6. The Ozaru was Huge not twice the size of man.7. Master Roshi lived on an island as a turtle hermit...hence the name.WHERE WAS KRILLIN.8. Goku was such a happy person, but in this movie he seemed so angry.9.Piccolo didn't wanna destroy the world he wanted to rule it.I'm sorry to say this but I love Dragonball Z it was a good movie but your ruined the story"
locust47,An insult to fans,2/10,29 April 2009,"Let me begin by saying that I am a Dragonball fan. It got me into watching anime and it's my favorite one to this day.Now when I heard that there was a Dragonball live action movie in production, I was pretty skeptic, knowing that it would be pretty hard to stay true to Torayama's vision. I had numerous discussions with friends that were also fans on how much of what was in the manga and in the anime could be done using real actors and sets. All my doubts disappeared as soon as the movie started. To put it in short, Dragonball Evolution is the reason that America should never try to do anything based on an anime.I mean I can understand that recreating the Dragonball universe isn't easy, but they didn't even try. In this ''americanized'' vision, Goku is the awkward emo-guy that gets picked on by bullies only to discover his true strentght by trying to impress a chick. And he isn't the only one to get the ''pussy'' treatment. The kame-hame-ha is now ''air bending'' and is apparently used for blowing out candles and other household chores, Piccolo looks like a green Frankenstein, Goku's great ape transformation is reduced to a werewolf-like thing, and generally, the battles feel weak(especially the final battle), done with second hand CGI.The least the screenwriter cold have done is stick to the story, but no. Goku is some sort of demon crash-landed on a meteor working for Piccolo in a clichéd spiritual inner fight to find his good self.The only good(and I use the term lightly) thing about this movie is the casting of Bulma, which both looks and sounds like her anime counterpart. Chow-Yun Fat is also mildly amusing as master Roshi, but you have to wonder if he isn't thinking ''what the hell am I doing in this movie''.In conclusion, Dragonball Evolution is a film apparently made for television, a disgrace to the anime and manga and an insult to the fans. As for casual moviegoers, it's mildly entertaining, but you could definitely find something better. A lot better..."
ESPAlexi600,Wow..... Just...Wow.,1/10,12 April 2009,"I finished watching this movie... I must admit i didn't legally watch this movie. This is a mockery to every single aspect of what is probably the most influential manga/anime series ever. This is NOT Dragonball. It's Spider man with Dragon ball characters... scratch that characters with dragonball names in it. The story is incredibly simple. It's the type of script where nothing but a piece of paper on a desk and someone just took a dump on it and BAM you have DBE. The Director seemed to put less effort in this movie than a fart and the acting was so weird. It's not that the acting was bad (it wasn't good either) it's just they weren't portraying the characters they where supposed to.Goku, the strongest character in any series and the most happy-go-lucky man-child into a teen aged idiot who seems to be more awkward that the one kid in the corner with a pocket protector, glasses and a inhaler with no friends. This is just sad. I saw the preview and I knew Goku wasn't going to be like Goku but a Gohan but i was wrong... He's a Peter Parker only even more awkward and even less interesting. Bulma is TRYING to be smart and pulls really crappy Puns. It's just not funny. Just stay away from this Movie. Enough sequels Get someone new that knows how to direct, and PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't pay to watch this movie. I don't want fox to earn a dime off of butchering my favorite childhood show."
bcrain,My boy and his friends loved it!,10/10,22 April 2009,"I know this is probably heresy to some of you who have seen this movie and were hoping for the ultimate Dragonball epic and were hacked off when you didn't get it, but I recommend it highly to anyone who has young boys. I took two nine year old boys, a 7 year old boy, and a 5 year old boy, and they had a great time. They talked about it non-stop for hours that evening. I went to see the movie because of the great Chow Yun-Fat, and I was able to somewhat enjoy the movie on its own terms. I wouldn't recommend thinking about it too much on the way home. I do admit that it's probably best that I didn't know much about Dragonball heading into the theater and thus I didn't have very high expectations going in. Therefore, in summary, I would personally give the movie about a 5 or 6 out of 10, but as entertainment for my boy and his friends, I give it an enthusiastic 10 out of 10.

mssobieski,A Fan of the Series Upset with Direction.,3/10,15 September 2009,"Well, First off, lets see... Goku's first encounter with piccolo was when he was like 7, and he started changing to monkey boy at a much younger age. Also, he wasn't hidden there to awaken at eighteen, oh, and he had a tail, what happened with the tail man? Not to mention, he lived in the future where things were all mostly capsule. I think the best series that could have been put into a movie was NOT with piccolo, although I think he should've been involved as a MINOR character, but with Vegeta. Who, by the way, would have had a much more interesting storyline, being that hes the last prince of the saiyans and one of the only surviving members of that race besides Goku, and they could have had Goku change to the monkey middle of the movie, and super saiyen later in the movie. That would've been so much better.The special effects were SEVERELY lacking, but I think that is because this must've been a lower budget movie (especially when looking at piccolo whoever designed that costume for piccolo must've NEVER watched the series, the dragon ball character never looked like that, ever, he looked like a cheap green knockoff of piccolo). Master Roshi was okay, but I don't like the casting for the part, it would've been much better handled in the hands of someone older.The guy that played Goku was actually pretty decent. Chi-Chi was decent as well, although Goku usually let her beat his butt and let her have his way cause he loved her so much. Bulma falling for Yamicha was almost comical and WHERE WAS KRILLEN!!!!!!@! Krillen was one of my favorite characters by far and he was no where to be found.All in all, I think this movie had potential, but unfortunately they let the script be written by screenwriters instead of fan boy screenwriters."
twanmul,Dragonball Devolution,2/10,28 March 2009,"By watching this, you are either ruining your fond memories of the Dragonball series or just confusing yourself with this shoddy excuse for a story. Some people here seem to think that there is a justification for the changes to; time line, characters, ages, story, facts and everything else you knew and loved in the dragonball world. These people however are wrong as the Saiyan Saga from Dragonball Z would have made a much better adaptation than this total mash of different parts of Dragonball.It is such a disappointment to the degree of computer game adaptations (Remember Dead or Alive or Streetfighter? This is worse), seeing Ben Affleck cast as Daredevil or Rogue not being a hot Texan woman who can fly and kick ass in X-men!If you are at all interested in DB, then please watch the TV series or even better, read the manga which is free online and nothing like this rubbish.I will be calling BBC rogue traders on James Wong for ripping off every person who pays even a penny to see this film. Whilst you wait for the undoubtedly better sequel (it CAN'T get any worse), hope that a better, more accurate cast is put in place.The only saving grace of this film and the only reason I gave it a '2' is due to the SFX, which are amazing. The only fall back of these were the design of shenglong who was a 'western fantasy style dragon,' therefore not long enough and the ki blast effects which were weak fire at best and not really anything to do with the SFX dept. directly, but the designers of the film."
Calaboss,I Love It When Children Rate Movies,5/10,28 December 2011,"The rating and reviews for this movie are too funny. When children decide to become movie critics, they really emote the STUPID, with no concept of what qualities comprise good or bad. Just check the reviewers that rate this movie with one star and see how many of them have only reviewed ONE movie; this one. Apparently the kiddies really like some Japanese comics called manga, or cartoons called anime, that this movie was based on. And since the movie didn't adhere to the version they like, they all got their little panties in a bunch.I've never read or seen another version, and having never seen anything this movie was based on, I can give you a clean review from an adult perspective.This movie was a fair watch. The action was good and there was lots of it. The writing was about what you'd expect for a movie of this nature; neither good nor bad. The CGI was pretty decent, and the actors playing the characters were all very likable and charismatic. And I must say, Jamie Chung is so good looking she makes me wish I was in my 20's again. I'd never seen her before and I had to look her up, but she's a real eye-popper. Faces like that always make me enjoy a movie more. Make no mistake, this isn't Casablanca or The Godfather, but rating it as average is certainly fair.And as for you kids that will give a thumbs down to my review just because this movie didn't match some cartoon version, you obviously have never seen a REALLY bad movie. If you think this was bad, you might look on-line and watch Night Train to Mundo Fine, Monster a-Go Go, or The Wild World of Batwoman (I think they are all available for free viewing, as nobody cares about copyrights on them). Those movies are truly BAD. Plots you can't follow, lack of continuity, microphones in frame, horrible acting, bad lighting and sound, and more clichés than you can name. Seeing movies like those can really give you some perspective on what's bad.Dragonball: Evolution just doesn't even come close to being as horrible as you make it sound. Sorry, but just because you throw a temper tantrum on-line doesn't make this a bad movie."
cheeseman-82883,I'd rather take a crap on my iPad and smear it all over my eyes than watch DragonballEvolution,1/10,19 July 2015,"Not only does son goku look like my arsewhole on a bad day, but his dialog throughout the whole movie was written by a 6 year old girl who recently visited Disneyland.Also, everything else is bad. Waste of my life I feel sorry for anyone who watched this movie by accident The fact that the director wasn't burned alive for making a movie out of play dough disgusts me deeply. Holy cow. And what a dense stab at the franchise of dragonball. Jesus would stab himself in his eyes.Jaws revenge should win an Oscar compared to this crap, I feel as if the leading actors in this film should quit now before they totally destroy anyone's else's idea of a good move. Peace"
Floated2,It wasn't that bad,6/10,10 August 2009,"I know this movie is getting a lot of hate from GB fans because many things were different from the movie and TV/comics series. But this movie wasn't really trying to be exactly like the show. For one thing, in the show Goku never went to school. In the movie he goes to school and thats where he meets Chi-Chi. Thats way off but not that bad. The movie is about Goku who who is set out upon his grandpa dying request to find the great Master Roshi and find all 7 of the dragonballs (he already has one). Upon his journey, he meets Bulma, Master Roshi, and Yamcha. They need to find the dragonballs before Picolo does or else bad things happen.The acting is kinda bad and very noticeable. The fight scenes aren't that great but its alright. The movie is entertaining and thats why its pretty good. So overall the movie passed my liking, being greater than that cheesy Street Fighter movie that came out this past February.Dragonball Evolution 6/10"
Emphinix,Us fans were right,2/10,9 August 2009,"First of all, I knew this was a very bad idea to make this movie in the first place. James Wong is terrible directing this movie, I knew he would screw this up since directing ""The One"" which was a very bad movie as well.I remember watching the Taiwanese movie ""Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins"", and to tell the truth, they respected and stuck to the plot as well. I've been watching the Dragon Ball series in my childhood and my teens as well. And I really enjoyed watching the anime, I saw it from Dragon Ball to DBGT.Here is a list of things of how this movie was screwed up by ""Americanizing"" it, like they did with Japanese owned shows like the Super Sentai aka Power Rangers, and so on.1. Goku was never Bulma's age 2. Grandpa Gohan was already dead at the time of the King Piccolo saga 3. Goku was never a high school reject 4. Mai was never a part of Piccolo's group since she was with Pilaf 5. I hated how they took off Master Roshi's comical and perverted side6. Goku cannot turn unless he has a tail.So you see, that is why I believed that making this movie was a very bad idea in the first place, and now, they're making a sequel. My question is; ""How can you make a sequel, when the first movie was not a success?"" My overall score is a 2 out of 10."
Jangobadass,"Not for everyone, but still entertaining",6/10,14 April 2009,"Back in 2002 or 3, Fox Studios announced it would be making a live action, theatrical version of the popular anime series, DRAGON BALL Z. But I thought ""They should make a DRAGON BALL"" movie first to introduce audiences to the world of the seven mystical, wish granting orbs and the heroic Goku and his super powered friends and enemies before diving into the fairly dense DBZ.Well, they did. Unfortunately, Fox had little interest in properly supporting the project and the final result is something that certainly won't appeal to everyone. But I found myself liking it.You'll find many negative reviews of DBE around here and they have some valid points against it, but if you watch a movie just to have a good time and to be entertained, then it's good to kill some time. It's not a great movie by any means, but far from being one of the worst or even THE worst, as some have been (unfairly) calling it.The hate comes from the fact that DB is one of the all time classic anime shows, which set some rules and a standard that many a anime ""shonen"" action show still follow to this day. It was funny, exciting, intriguing, and some times a little moving as Goku made new friends and fought strange bad guys while hunting the Dragon Balls. DBZ was an even bigger hit (though I don't quite understand why), with epic, slam-bang, over the top battles between super beings that tore up the landscape around them. This is also part of the hate, as many fans associate the two shows as one and think of DBZ more than DB, meaning they were expecting some pretty big knock downs, forgetting that many of the fights in DB were shorter, yet with more variety as everyone had his or own special moves.Fox also dug themselves a hole by releasing it in Asia nearly a month before it came to America, and several countries in between along the way, causing it to suffer from much piracy. So by the time it got to America, many fans had already passed judgment from watching the bootleg and causing a very bad word of mouth.I wanted to give final judgment when I saw it for myself. And truth be told, I kinda like it.I'll admit it's flawed. There is little here that hasn't been done before and nothing that hasn't been down better in other movies and even TV shows. A lot of them. You'll see better fights, better special effects, better pacing and certainly better acting than you will here. However, you could also do a lot worse, which puts poor DBE in an uncomfortable grey area of mediocrity. How you enjoy it will depend on your individual tastes and standards.The story combines the first Dragon Ball Hunt from the early episodes of the show with the ""King Piccolo"" arc that came later in the series. This alone is part of the problem, as the two story lines are very different in style and tone: early DB had a lot of crude humor and silliness while the King Piccolo story was when things started getting more serious and action packed. Combining the two makes for a strange mix, as DBE keeps shifting in tone from comedic to dramatic every few scenes.It has young Goku (Justin Chatwin) going on a hunt for the 7 Dragon Balls at the last request of his adoptive grandfather (Randall Duk Kim) to protect them from the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) with help from techno-wiz Bulma (Emmy Rossum), martial arts master Roshi (Chow Yun Fat) and bandit Yamcha (Joon Park).It's supposed to be an epic, rich and eventful story and as a comic and animated show it was fairly deep. But DBE rushes through it in eighty five minutes, with short explanations that don't really explain much, even when repeated to help the audience keep up. In particular, Piccolo makes sporadic appearances that make him a better plot device than villain until the movie's climax. And there's a BIG plot hole I won't bring up here because it would give a big twist away, but I will say it'll cause shouts of ""WTF?!"" Rumor has it that screen writer Ben Ramsey originally wrote a more eventful, action packed script, but it was rewritten and simplified when the film's budget turned out to be smaller than they'd originally hoped for.Despite its flaws, I found myself liking it. There were many moments that amused me, some scenes I found genuinely entertaining, and even some performances I liked. For example, I found Chatwin likable much of the time, while I found his bad moments quite funny. And I thought Kim, Marsters, and Jamie Chung (as Goku's love interest Chi-Chi) gave solid performances even though they weren't given much to work with. I even enjoyed Park's cheesy ""surfer dude"" like take on Yamcha, finding it pretty amusing. The earlier fights actually felt like something from DB to me, and the final battle looked an awful lot like something from DBZ.In the end, how you feel about DRAGON BALL EVOLUTION all depends. It's far from great, but I think a lot people will still find it entertaining on some level. It's no masterpiece by any means, but it'll provide some solid entertainment if you give it a chance."
BA_Harrison,"If you think this is bad, try watching Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.",5/10,19 April 2017,"Justin Chatwin stars as teenager Goku, who must use his special fighting skills to prevent the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) from collecting all seven Dragonballs and using them for evil purposes. Goku is aided in his quest by master Roshi (Hong Kong action legend Chow Yun-Fat), school-friend and object of Goku's affection Chi Chi (Jamie Chung), gun-toting babe Bulma (Emmy Rossum), and thieving rascal Yamcha (Joon Park). As the group locate the dragonballs using Bulma's tracking device, they are attacked by Piccolo's sexy henchwoman Mai (Eriko Tamura).The plot for this live-action manga movie is all over the place, the acting is wooden and the special effects not so special, but I still managed to have some fun with the whole sorry mess, possibly because I had my expectations set extremely low after recently watching the lousy Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, partly down to the fact that I had no prior knowledge of the Dragonball graphic novels (and so wouldn't be disappointed by inaccuracies), but mostly because I was clearly in the mood for some mindless martial arts fantasy nonsense with several babes in cleavage enhancing costumes.And that's precisely what I got lots of silly kung fu action aided by wire-work and CGI and three hotties with their bosoms making up for their poor performances. Can't say that it has forever changed the way I look at film, or that it will even stay with me until the week is out, but I wasn't bored by its banality, miffed by its mediocrity, or angry at its inanity, which must count for something.4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for Chow Yun-Fat chewing up the scenery."
diac228,"Dragonball fans, you can cry now. But don't say they didn't try.",3/10,12 April 2009,"Before even reading this review, you knew that the film was going to fail. You knew that there was no way that a modernized version of a brilliant anime that didn't even have the entire cast of characters (in the first episodes that is) was going to disappoint and deliver garbage. However, the difference between this remake/re-imagining of the animated cartoon and the typical Hollywood remake is the amount of effort. This was not some half-arsed production or cheap attempt to sell more toys and make quick money. This was an actual futile attempt to create a new storyline for the franchise that has been around since the 80s and jump-started the anime craze that eventually hit the United States in the late 90s. But yes the movie is bad. Yes the movie is muddled with clichés, over-blown special effects, wooden writing, and a weak ending. Yet, the energy and flair throughout the production stood out, and the potential for an evolving franchise that jumps from miserably bad to good is there. There is some bit of hope; you just have to deal with the fact that they aren't going to follow the original storyline at all. Maybe it's the fanboyism talking that if they listen; they can deliver a superior work of Dragonball. That or I might be utterly crazy. In the meantime, we shall gripe. 1) Oolong, Vegeta, Turtle, Ox King, Puar, Krillin are not in the film 2) There are no extremely lengthy fights like in the television show 3) Bulma is a gun-wielding feminine cowgal 4) Yamcha has blonde hair 5) Master Roshi was not living in a very secluded island with a palm tree next to it 6) There is only one signature move mentioned in the film 7) Piccolo wasn't green 8) The Great Ape is reduced to angry Donkey KongIf you are not at all ruffled at the previous complaints, then you aren't a fanboy, and can continue reading this so you know why the film fails. If you did get upset, stop reading, because odds are you are already protesting. Dragonball Evolution is most certainly not going to appeal to any of the true-blue fans of the show; those that saw Goku's travels from child to multiple deaths to wonderful memory. As for those who want to know what Dragonball is all about, skip this as well. If you are willing to accept a new vision of Dragonball, read on. To make the plot synopsis simple: Goku must recover 7 dragonballs in order to prevent Piccolo from creating apocalyptic havoc across the planet. With the help of Bulma, Master Roshi and Yamcha, he sets off to try to rid the world of evil using the dragonballs. This film has all the nods to other ""young lad must rise up to overcome challenges despite incredible odds."" The clichés are fired so often, you can predict the next one. It's pretty clear that the writers knew about the anime and the characters, but didn't study about it deeply at all. Its one thing to know the show, it's another thing to truly know the show. Example: makers of Twilight Zone Tower of Terror saw every Twilight Zone episode 3 times. End result is an attraction that literally looks like a Twilight Zone episode. In the case of Dragonball Evolution, it has the characters, some of the familiar characterizations, but that's about it. Blaming the acting would be wrong, since they provided well with the material they had. Justin Chatwin as Goku is a mixed bag; he can play the role, but doesn't resemble Goku that much. Chi-Chi herself doesn't look like Chi-Chi, but Jamie Chung plays the role with a nice dosage of beauty and feistiness. Same goes with Bulma, portrayed by Emmy Rossum. Last but not least, the best performance comes from Yun-Fat Chow, who plays Master Roshi perfectly. Too bad the turtle sidekick from the cartoon was missing. Bottom Line: Let's just wrap the review simply with this: It sucks, but could have been halfway decent if the clichés weren't flying and there was more research plastered into the production. While a Dragonball movie outside the manga series actually following the franchise plot lines is inevitable (there have been two live-action films already) the effort placed in this installment was actually uplifting, even if the quality of the movie itself destroyed any positive feelings. Dragonball itself is an amazingly charming story full of rich characters, why not do a highly accurate adaptation? The only reason to see this movie is the only reason I went to see it: for nostalgia sakes, to reminisce the good times of Toonami. Don't expect miserable utter failure, but expect a bad movie with a few good moments and elements."
donjayallen,Utter crap!,1/10,23 March 2009,"Im a 1st time writer on here but due to some BS reviews I had to give my 2cents, What a load of CRAP!!!@!!!!! My son could make a better movie than this and I don't even have a son! I mean common man none of the characters looked like the anime characters, I wish they could hit all the people who watched this crap with that lost memory gun they used on MIB and sacked the whole film crew that made this garbage and started from scratch, and maybe get a director that has actually watched the series not some guy with a Asian name just to sit more bums at the theater's, I'm so glad I didn't waste money watching this crap at a cinema!!!! But I still feel ripped off! I'm so angry at the moment because DB is one of the all time great anime's! And to be f#$#d like that really pisses me off! And too all those people saying that this is a GREAT movie..we all know who u work forfox must be paying u well because it must be hard sleeping at night with the smell of BS coming out of your mouths! REBOOT THIS MOVIE PLSSSSS

yolibarvueswag,Even Worse Than The Last Airbender,1/10,4 October 2019,"Good lord, this movie is garbage. I didn't even know it was a DBZ movie and I thought it was some crappy parody or something. This doesn't feel like a Dragon Ball movie at all. It feels like a rushed middle school project.To be fair, the writer of Evolution has admitted he never watched Dragon Ball, but I didn't think it would be this bad.The characters look nothing like they did in the source material, and they don't even act the same. Krillin is not in the movie, Roshi looked like a some 60 year old man wanting to be hip with kids, Bulma is now a bounty hunter? Since when? It's kinda sad how the only characters that were almost accurate were Gohan and Mai.But let's talk about the biggest thing they got wrong. Goku. He's nothing like the one we all know, he's apparently this socially awkward, teen womanizer that goes to school....You know the movie's bad when Toriyama himself also hated the movie."
celesmoon,"The Movie that shouldn't have been called ""Dragonball"".",1/10,3 April 2009,"OK that it is inspired on Dragonball, but the only thing that it has in common with the manga is - the Dragonballs; - the evil guy.All was totally changed, so much that it seems another Karate Kid movie: - the surroundings resemble 3/4 of the screen time a typical American neighborhood; - Goku is a pacifist-socially clumsy American-like teenager that wants to fit,'be normal'and know girls, but he is bullied at school by the super-clichéd group of tough & cool bad boys; - All the characters, minus the bad evil guy, are dressed and act like they have been taken from a typical American High School movie.Helloo film-makers, Dragonball is basically a Fantasy-Martial arts story!!! That's the least fans expect to see, not a covered up high-school story of a social loser that becomes cool.Yes, I'm a fan that is complaining, irked and disappointed for the waste of such potential plot. Even if I saw the movie mentally prepared to accept a deep change of the story (that usually is not per se a bad thing, because it gives a different 'what-if' development that gives new life to the merchandise), I was appalled by the common clichés and lack of creativity.So to sum it up: Unwatchable for the fan, poorly entertaining for the casual watcher, because of its unoriginality. Special effects and battles do not save the movie as they are mediocre and we've already used to see so much better."
the_holiday_song,Why is Goku in the stupid high school?,1/10,30 March 2009,"I don't have seen the movie and i will not.This is not a movie about the Dragon Ball saga, is just another waste of money by 20 century fox. Is a offense to the fans of the comic. Why? why is Goku in the stupid high school??? Does the person who wrote the screenplay knows something about Dragon Ball?? I really don't understand why is too hard trying to keep the characters as they are, instead of do meaningless copies. Why the hair of Bulma isn't blue? Was too much expensive hire the right hair stylist for the task? Why is Goku in the high school??? Also why is Goku so old if when he meets Bulma is just a kid? Why is Goku in the high school??? Where is Krillin? Why is Roshy so young? And why is Goku so skinny, pale and in the stupid high school???? My God! I can't believe the ability of the Fox to make crap of diamonds, they're absolutely very talented on that; the only skills of the producer is in taking bad choices, a stupid writer, the worst cast, and the worst make up. That was one of the comics that i wanted to see in the big screen since i was child, but this piece of crap just too far to be Dragon Ball. Stupid high school. Stupid Fox... Sigh... now i'm sad."
victorflietstra,extremely bad flick,1/10,15 September 2009,"It was awful, I was prepared for the worsed and I think that you should rate movies on the category in which they are made. So you can't say Transformers 1 was bad, because it wasn't all bad it was okay in it's own category. But Dragonball Evolution was just all bad, acting was terrible, special effects were okay but not something for a manga spin off, more something for a action movie and this shouldn't have been an action movie but more a manga. I can understand that the story had to be modified, but in this case the totally murdered it, add extremely bad directing, bad acting and semi good effects(which are extremely bad if you reckon they had a 100 million budget) and this movie goes into my worsed movies ever right alongside 'A View From The Top'. Movies after which you get the urge to kill yourself. Go watch it but keep in mind you will waste 100 minutes of your life.

melipp,why did you go and screw up dragon ball z!?,1/10,10 April 2009,"the already ruined the movie by not sticking with the original... come on now, i' am not being a racist or anything like that but stick with the program! why didn't you place an Asian guy as Goku Mr. director?! i have watched dragon ball z anime religiously since i was a kid and for you to add that small little feature to it just ruined it! i wonder what the Asian's think of this... even my friends who are American thinks this was ridiculous and i hope that if there is another dragon ball z project that someone else'll pick it up and stick with the original!!! Why do you cast agents/directors feel the need to change everything just because you need to ""americanize"" it? Everyone loves the original so please stick to it. stop ruining the great quality of the film/anime please.

KaderoC,Just as bad as you've heard.,1/10,10 November 2009,"Don't waste your time. Seriously.I wouldn't even bother to call this an 'adaptation'. It's more like a badly written fanfic: you know, one of those really bad 'DB characters in high school' ones.It was very fast paced and rushed, and I pretty promptly forgot most of the movie as soon as I was finished watching it (which I can only sum up as good fortune).I won't try and echo what hundreds of way more in-depth reviews written here before me have already said. I'll cut right to the chase: Don't waste perfectly good money on this piece of trash. It's not even one of those bad movies that's good for a laugh. You'll probably just wind up confused and, if you're a fan of the anime, probably more infuriated than anything.But hey. At least Piccolo was green."
geronimo-32,blah blah,1/10,10 April 2009,"i have seen every db/dbz/dbgt etc movie, manga, anime, oav, game, etc. i know almost every little detail of it and am considered a fan boy.simply put, i went into the movie expecting it to only share a few ideas with db. at best it wasn't db at all and i was hoping to enjoy just a decent movie that was completely standalone. i find that this movie lacked in developing a story, lack a good story period. poor character development, lack of clarification of the elements in the story. poor acting. i felt that the acting was rather amateur as if they were trying to remember their lines or reading off cue cards. the fighting choreography was horrible. music was mediocre. i'm not even upset that the story is butchered, look at other anime's or classic comics etc. there is always those extra stories or movies or etc that come along and make no sense with the story and maybe even butcher up the character but its still an awesome read/watch. this movie was not. i'm amazed that they're working on a part 2. i hope the writers will do the right thing and instead of just profiting off the name sake i hope they actually make a good story no matter how much they deviate from it and find better acting talent and directing overall."
ChristianSlater4000,Better than the anime,10/10,4 October 2021,"My name is Nicholas Toste, and when I went to watch this movie (masterpiece) for the first time, I came in expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised to find this excellent piece of cinema not only is nearly a shot for shot remake of the anime, but it in fact surpasses the source material. A truly amazing experience, I highly highly highly recommend. If you dislike this review I'll shut up.

mejgan,Dragonball Failovution,2/10,11 April 2009,"""Dragonball: Evolution. The movie made by Fox as a live action adaptation of the popular anime series Dragonball.Now, I knew what I was getting into when I stepped into the theater earlier today, but that didn't stop me from being enraged at the blasphemy that unfolded in front of me. I know this review will be a little biased, as I am a Dragonball fan, but let me start off by saying that this movie is TERRIBLE. Fox really screwed up on this one. It doesn't even seem like they tried at all. Now, lets review the movie piece by piece.Plot: Fox had an entire wealth of story an characters and everything to go off of t o make this movie. What did they do? They tried to make their own story. they failed. Horribly. Let's address the length. 1 hour and 10 minutes roughly. Movies now adays are usually an hour and a half to 2 hours long, but AN HOUR AND TEN MINUTES. That's not near long enough to get any of the story to Dragonball out.The movie went way too fast. There was virtually no time for character development. Scenes moved way too fast, the story went too fast, and overall the movie was too fast (which could be a good or a bad thing).The story itself. It just doesn't seem like Dragonball. the plot just seemed like generic action movie. You could've replaced all the characters and it would've made just as much sense. There were so many flaws and inconsistencies with the actual Dragonball story (way too many to write about right now). Any Dragonball fan will just be asking Why? the entire time. Also, Goku going to high school. WTF?! Let's just move onCharacters: Let me just get this off my chest, JUSTIN CHATWIN IS NOT GOKU, AND HE NEVER WILL BE. Now, Goku's character, if you've never seen the series, is basically happy, dumb, and doesn't know the ways of the world. In the movie, however, he is typical anxiety, smart-ass teenager. The character is nothing like Goku in any way shape or form, physically, or in behavior.Next character: Bulma. Again physically looks nothing like Bluma. They put one streak of blue in her hair I guess to make people tell that she's Bulma. Since when can we not give characters colored hair? Seriously, what the hell? She seems like much more of a bitch than she does in the series. Not much character development there.Master Roshi: Master Roshi is supposed to be a perverted old man who teaches Goku the Kamehameha. He teaches Goku the Kamehameha, but he is in no way the Master Roshi I knew.Chi Chi: Goku's love interest. Since when is Chi Chi the popular chick? Other than that she just seems like a generic love interest.Yamcha: First of all, he's blond. WTF? Second of all, they actually got this character pretty good, voice and all. It just doesn't match the look of the character. Also, WHERE'S THE WOLF FANG FIST?!King Piccolo: All I can say is, Space Voldemort.Mai: Just a random villain character because I guess they couldn't pick out any of the other various villains of Dragonball.Overall, the characters just have no uniqueness to them, none of that special Dragonball flavor that they're supposed to have. None of the characters seem like themselves, with the exception of Yamcha, and there's virtually no character development.Special effects: The special effects are very low grade in this film. The ki blasts look okay. The Kamehameha does not look like a Kamehameha. Piccolo looks like Voldemort. Shenlong looks like a generic dragon, and doesn't speak. Oozaru looked horrible (too small, and Goku didn't have a tail in which to transform).I'm sure I left out a lot, but I just don't feel like typing about this anymore. If you're a Dragonball, fan do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Watch it online if you just HAVE to see it. This movie is NOT Dragonball, only in names (which they surprisingly got right). Overall, terrible movie, and will never see it again. Also, they are actually making a SEQUEL!! WHY?!?!?! No......just no. Fox, you've already ruined it. Stop beating the already dead, burned, chopped up, and run over, horse."""
cohmasta,"A total screwup of a great anime, i just cant believe it. :(",1/10,14 April 2009,"All i can say to this is, what a DISASTER, i loved the anime series (DB/DBZ/DBGT)and consider myself a die-hard fan but with this movie they have screwed up, i do not get how could Akira ever agree with this movie, it totally sucks, is not true to its story and it feels to me like they just wanted to make some quick bucks over this legendary anime, and i recommend any die-hard fans of this great anime to NOT watch this piece of crap and not support this by buying the DVD or give em money of this Evo Crap.I am so disappointed in this movie, i watch the full movie and when it was done i was like, NOOOOOO you are shitting me, is this it?!!!!!. its a disgrace to the Dragonball legend as its a awesome anime and i loved it and i recommend everyone to see Dragonball Z/GT Anime and you will understand why this movie sucks.i made a account just to comment on this Evolution Crap(sorry this gets me angry, a total fuckup of a great anime) Shame i cant give it a vote of 0 else it would get that, so a 1(awfull) this gets from me.Mind you this comes from a 27(soon 28) year die-hard dbz/gt fan."
dleet-930-249422,"Terrible Movie, Bad Casting, Even Worse Plot",1/10,3 January 2011,"Hey, I have an Idea, lets take one of the most popular animes of all time, and change the storyline entirely, because even though that plot line brought millions of fans from Japan and America together in loving one character Goku together. Hey even better, lets cast Goku, as this Skinny white dude that looks like a total douche the whole movie, in fact, lets change ENTIRE PLOT SEQUENCES and things from the original movie, cause who wants to watch a a small 8 year old kid beat the living hell out of aliens from another planet.... I was so disappointed in this movie I cannot even begin to describe it entirely. First off, Piccolo looks terrible, Goku is a complete disaster from the original intent of the character ( a warm adventure loving innocent child who gets into adventures and discovers the inner power within him to defeat evil) somehow gets turned into a 17 year old kid who gets picked on in school and has to ""play it down"" and let the bigger kids whomp on him to be normal, but yet still has no problem showing off even while having almost no real saiyan power.... The sequencing of events was just terrible, and a joke. I think the thing I have to say out of all of this the most is that I was so sad about this movie, I literally burned my copy and told all my friends to never watch it as it was a travesty of the original story.They should have stuck a little closer to the original story, and had some awesome cgi effects (which there were VERY little of) and kept Goku as a child to have that awesomeness factor of watching a kid beat the crap out of adults.In the end, I wouldn't recommend my worse enemy to watch this movie if they were in any way shape or form a fan of the original dragon ball series."
jerkar,Worst movie ever.,1/10,5 April 2011,"Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of Dragonball (the entire series, yes including GT) and I went to this movie not expecting to much due to the trailers and actors involved. I came out with tears in my eyes and it's not because the movie was emotional. I was crying because this was the worst possible destruction of a classic series. This abomination takes only names of the show and adds it's own story, which it wouldn't be so bad if the characters stayed the way they were in the show but the problem with it is that the story that is was replaced with is unholy.In fact, let me type whats wrong with this uneven mess: ---Horrendous, god awful, wooden, terrible acting coming from everyone involved in the production (Especially coming from Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung) and the characters in the movie are so shallow and dumb and not in any way heroic.---A story so short, underdeveloped, inconsistent, filled with plot holes and not the least bit similar to Dragonball.---A frankly sad and ridiculous attempt at fighting is show in the film and all the fights lack emotion, last under 2 minutes and they're monstrously choreographed, fights in any other action film are way better.---Fake looking sets that have nothing in common on what is was based on and were to futuristic for my taste.---Cheap special effects that looked hideous.---An uninspired soundtrack accompanied the movie.---The direction by James Wong is the worst ever, if all that was mentioned above was any indication. I mean seriously Wong brought nothing out of the actors, took a very loose script of the show and made even more changes making it seem shallow, pathetic and bland, took away the spirit what made Dragonball great and inserted bad morals, made the characters nothing like show, directed the ''action scenes'' so badly, edited nothing that fits. He made a downright titanic clusterfck of a movie! Before I forget, everybody involved in the making of this turd claimed that they were fans when in fact later they come out and said the movie is better than what is was based off and called the original show childish and stupid. So much for the statement that the actors were fans.As you can see nothing good comes out of this film.It gets nothing/10"
jose_andres200853,Didn't expect it to be THIS bad!,1/10,15 February 2012,"I thought I was going to watch the awesome and superb series I used to watch as a little kid. No! I was expecting to stand up and cheer, because Im a true Dragon Ball Z fan. Yet being one, I exited the movies and left with my mouth opened: Hell No! This couldn't happen. The thing is that I had seen one of the top 3 shittiest movies of my life, on top Alvin and the Chipmunks and Super 8. It was horrible! The graphics were cheapy, the Kamehameha scene was just too fast and less expansive and the story lines weren't well desrcibed. And One more thing: Why would you want to name a bad guy by Piccolo?! It's a kiddie name is you tell me. The movie reveives and truly is honored to deserve an F-! :)"
blackopg,They destroyed my dream !,1/10,12 April 2009,"When I first found out that it's going to be a D-ball movie (finaly) it was the happiest day of my life! But now i'm facing the worst day! When I saw the trailer I realized the only connection with D-ball was the characters names and after the movie I saw some of them are missing. They forgot about Krilin, this is like making South Park without Butters or Harry Potter without Ron Weasley and you get the idea.The dragon balls were made by 7 mystics ... were did this come from? ( - D-ball anime spoiler - they were made by ""god"", who you later find out it's the good left from a alien who banished his evil inside him, that evil is Piccolo - D-ball anime spoiler - ) None of the homework for this movie were made! If they would have used different names/titles I don't know if i could've made the connection with D-ball !!!"
yues_woman,Would be great if it were a practical joke.,3/10,6 April 2009,"This was the funniest film I've seen all year. Don't tell me it wasn't a comedy! I know Dragonball, and that WASN'T it! I was just waiting for the director to pop up at the end, laughing, and say ""Nah, just kidding. The real Dragonball movie comes out next year! Fooled you!"". We'd all let out a sigh of relief and rejoice.Worst line:Goku: ""I must become one with two!"".No Goku! No you mustn't! You need to have someone cut your tail off. What, you don't have a tail? Well then, I guess we're all screwed! Honestly, just watch the anime. It's a million times better than this, and it doesn't have any of these stupid clichés."
j_jubb,"85 minutes of my life gone, thanks Fox",1/10,23 April 2009,"OMG, not since Mega-Force (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084316/) has such an abomination hit the big screen.It's obvious that no though went into any continuity between the animated characters compared to their respective (ha!) actors. Perhaps it was just me, but each characters direction seemed to be that of watching a colony of ants at work. In other words, you see that they were all doing something, but to the untrained eye you're not able to define their exact role. This was nothing more than 85 minutes of random events taking place. All I kept thinking was a quote from Peter Griffin ""my God! why don't somebody throw a pie!"". When the lights finally came on in the theater, the disappointed reaction from everyone (Dragon Ball fan or first time novice) was the same... PLEASE LORD, DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL.And why was Ernie Hudson in this spectacle? I'm just glad that he wasn't cased as Mr. Po-Po, or I would've really been offended!"
eccentrically_introverte,An Insult to DBZ,1/10,26 November 2019,"This movie is not just horrible, it makes any true fan of the actual series rage. Plot is absolutely atrocious, characters are ridiculous and stupid, and doesn't follow the cannon what so ever! It makes no sense and gives you a pain in the pit of your stomach. This movie is trash, mind-numbing shite that doesn't deserve to exist. Any true fan will hate this movie, so watch it only if you plan on wanting to die. 1/10, 0/10 if I could. Waste of my life and yours, don't watch it.

buttwhacker,Probably one of the worse movie adaption from an anime/comic ever,3/10,4 April 2009,"This is horrible. To all DB fans, I apologize on behalf for the entire cast and crew. The directing is amateurish, the cast is totally wrong, the acting is miserable, the special effects were made for children and don't even let me get started on the storyline.There's so much I want to say but let me just summarise in point for you:1. Where are Piccolo's feelers? 2. Goku's Oozaru form looks like an escaped over-sized gorilla from a zoo. Or a bonsai version of King Kong. 3. Why is the Eternal Dragon white (emitting a white glow) and why doesn't it speak? 4. The Eternal Dragon is puny and looks horrible just like Oozaru. 5. Why is a temple needed to summon the dragon? 6. Goku had been training long before the Piccolo saga. He did not cram everything in 24 hours. 7. My time-line may be off here but if I recall correctly, didn't Goku beat Piccolo as a kid? 8. Why is Piccolo's blood dark red/black? 9. Pathetic script lines throughout the movie.Shame on all of you especially James Wong and Stephen Chow. I think Ang Lee did a better job with The Incredible Hulk.Please do not make a sequel until a respectable remake has been produced. Fat hope but could you please take over Michael Bay? Pretty please?"
salontajmiroslav-857-471185,"Dragon Ball Evolution,worst movie ever",1/10,5 December 2013,"This is a total butchering of what I had held great hopes of seeing. The movies attempts to follow the dragon ball story line, meanwhile adding a ""modern"" spin on it (ie. chi chi's castle, and Master Roshi lives in a regular semi whats up with that?). What the viewers want to see is a storyline that follows the cartoon series without any changes, and additions. Overall, the plot is weak, the characters do not look like the cartoons (ie. Yamcha, Master Roshi), the 2D cartoon series had better special effects than the movie (and the series had NO special effects, thats how terrible it was). I created an IMDb account JUST to comment on how they butchered Dragonball for me and I hope that Hollywood is smarter next time as to when they bring such a strong fan based series onto the big screens or they will only infuriate more of the audience.Hollywood is ruining my childhood memories!he creators of this horrible, horrible adaption should take a good long think about what they have done and why they should have just followed the source material instead of taken it for granted. Do they really think that the entire Dragonball fan-base is this stupid? Akira Toriyama probably has a noose around his neck right about now.Parts that are supposed to be taken out are not. you can not deny how bad the script was .. I mean Potentially Changing the original story that much i was OK with it because DB-Franchise is very airy so you can revamp characters and situations. However The way the story was presented SUCKED BIG TIME ..Its Amazing Cheeziness for 2009 .. But then again thats James Wong for you ."
alishadabsyed,Childhood Ruined!!!,1/10,1 October 2015,"If you are a true DBZ fan, avoid ''even thinking'' about watching this garbage..... Its a shame too see such slaughtering of the original... This so called DBZ Action, Adventure, Fantasy film offers the following:-Lame action scenes... -Cheesy dialogues... -CGI from the 70's (for the power blasts).... -Unbelievable weak plots -Reincarnated Piccolo (''yeah'') -Inappropriate casting -laughable costumes -Filled with all the clichés you can imagine... And you know what the list stretches... But I am going to stop right here, and urge you all to watch DBZ series than waisting time and money on this Sh*T....

photo-28409,Even worst than a 1 star review,1/10,29 July 2022,"Of all my time as a movie goer I have never seen a movie as bad as this movie and I've seen nights adaptations of avatar the last air bender. In my opinion this movie should deserve a negative 10 on stars but unfortunately there isn't that option and the only reason it gets 1 stars is the commitment James marster and some of the other actors put in for their roles. James marster which probably made this movie better than it originally was I consider him the true hero of this film. As for the movie itself the story is awe full, the characters except for piccolo are no where near as how they are portrayed in the series, the fight scene are incredibly cringe worthy. The writer only read a short plot line from IMDb before writing this movie because he was only doing it for the paycheck. A movie that can have the greatest potential in Hollywood is reduced to one of the worst movie ever made and probably the worst although birdemic is a close call for the worst movie ever made. When the actors says it's a bad movie and the director knows this movie is doomed to fail from the beginning than you know it's bad beyond reason.

Nootered,We'll need dragon balls to revive all the characters killed in this atrocity!,1/10,7 November 2015,"NO NO NO NO NO! Unbelievable! How could anyone think this was a good idea. I don't even want to go into the plot. So I'm just going to try and get off this crappy film and try and review it as fast as possible for people thinking of watching this.The acting is god awful. Wrong casting everywhere. Bulma doesn't have blue hair and acts NOTHING like she did in the original. Nobody is right in this atrocity. A fact: The director didn't watch dragon ball z at all. It's always a good idea to give a director who doesn't know anything about the franchise to direct the film. Bloody brilliant. The effects. Oh those low budget effects. Two words: Hand Fart. Kamehameha looks like a freaking blue air pulse thing, and nothing about the moves had their explosive effect as they did in the original. The cgi sweat is plain embarrassing and I'm sure I could do better by inserting spheres in blender and covering them with stock footage textures.I'm not sure what they were thinking, but for the love of god: DO NOT MAKE A ANIME A LIVE ACTION FILM!"
rivertam26,???,7/10,18 July 2009,"I don't understand why everyone has such a problem with this movie. It's far from being the disaster that the Street Fighter movie was. I mean I have no idea what the anime is about or how close it sticks to it but I had a hell of a lotta fun watching this. It really felt like a live action anime. It featured a good looking cast, good special effects and pretty good fight scenes. Sure the film was silly and even less sillier than most animes are. It look a lot of getting used to to see what they were going for and truth be told somethings just work better animated. But all in all a very entertaining film not very deserving of the unfortunate rep its getting.

syrroch,Horrible and stinks of Hollywood racism.,1/10,4 May 2009,"This movie does DBZ series no justice. First off, you know how they cast a white guy in an obvious Asian role. Sure, he is an alien you say, but that's no excuse. He also has super powers to blow up an entire planet... what i'm trying to say is that Goku has black hair, eats Asian food, is married to an Asian woman, lives in an Asian country.. so on and so forth.. Let racist Hollywood put a white dude with his Asian wife.. I'm boycotting this movie and have advised all my friends not to watch it.. Let them lose their money on this flick. If you want to watch this crap.. do it for free using bit torrent or something.

FromWonderland,"Awful Dragonball movie, great Dragonball parody",1/10,27 July 2009,"It is obvious for any fan of the manga Dragon Ball that the minds behind this movie where not also fan of the series, and if they were they never understood what made it special, unique and good. I'm not against change and I can imagine you need to modify a story to carry it to big screen. But still if you're going to adapt a series with such a big fan community, you need to keep it's essence.What ruined the movie for me was that Goku's background was raped and transformed him in something he is not. The hero we knew lived alone in the forest with his grandfather and had no contact with civilization, which made him goofy, unadapted to the world and funny. In Dragonball Evolution, we got a teen Goku who's worried about bullies, girls, etc. The protagonist we loved was completely inverted 15 minutes through the movie.Basically, the makers of this movie couldn't create an interesting DB universe because they didn't have the guts to capture the essence of Dragon Ball, making a movie we can only call a parody. As a fan you will feel insulted while watching this movie. First because it has absolutely no respect for the original manga. Second because you will notice a few details (Goku eating this big chunk of meat or running next to the car with a gigantic package on his back) that were good and have you think this movie could have actually been awesome done with more effort from the entire crew.Anyway, watch it with humor or do not watch it at all."
jacqueskleynhans,"Dragon""balls"" :(",1/10,17 May 2009,"Lets start-off by saying, I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS NO ZERO RATING. This must be the worst movie ever. The fact that they are grabbing bits and pieces from all the old DB movies/series is a joke, this movie doesn't even make sense. I mean the best thing in this movie was probably the yellow dodge charger, can't think of anything else. O well thanks DB you knocked starship troopers 2 of my no.1 baddest movie ever list. I have been waiting so long for this movie that any mention of it I though yea another release date in a year or so, but when It finally arrived I nearly cried, and then after the movie I wanted to chew my ow wrist off. But yea thanks, I hope the $500 you made from this movie makes you happy. Can't someone with a Matrix budget remake this movie please!!!!!!!

death_too,Don't watch this film :S,1/10,1 October 2010,"Okay, so I knew this film was gonna be bad, but I didn't think they could actually screw something up quite so badly. I bought this from ASDA for £3, and I think I might take it back and say it was faulty, see if I can't spend that money on something a bit better.If you've no idea what Dragonball is (well, shame on you for one thing) or if you just wanna shove your kids in front of the TV or if you ever get given this DVD (in which case have nothing to do with the person who gave it you again), then I suppose it's one way to pass an hour and a bit. Another way would be to remove your teeth with a pair of pliers or maybe stick hot needles under your fingernails-both of which are less painful than watching this film.Firstly, it's awful. Characters, storyline, everything...just *shudders*...terrible is the only way to describe it. It's not like there's even a massive fight scene or anything, or that the movie goes anywhere-it just plods along at it's own pace and does it's own thing, and then ends. Goku is portrayed as your typical high-school loser who wants the girl etc (wrong) and then realises he's destined to save the world etc etc. Your basic crappy plot etc. Basically, don't watch this film. If you want to see it, e-mail me and I'll post mine to you for free, gladly, as it's a stain on my otherwise immaculate DVD collection.On a final note, why the hell was Mai working with Piccolo? She's one of Pilaf's people for shittings sake. And she kicked ass-that's not the Mai from the manga/anime!! And how awful was the casting of Yamcha who suddenly has shortish blonde highlighted hair and a face that'd been hit by a shitty shovel?!Any way, there you have it. This film sucks ass majorly. Don't buy it, don't even waste time downloading it. In fact, for a film like this, I'm all for piracy, maybe then they'll finally stop making crap."
dvalent,Its Just that bad,1/10,12 June 2009,"I really have no words to describe the major fail that this production, director and screenplay have made.I grew up reading the mangas of DB and DBZ and watching the cartoon series. I seriously cannot believe that the DB franchise have sold this name to produce this?! who said 'yes' to this!?I SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS MOVIE WILL BE ERASED FROM THE DB HISTORY AND IN NO FORM OR WAY TO BE CONSIDERED NOR RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL DRAGONBALL SERIES.Apart from that if u want to watch a mediocre action movie go see it(For free Though) BTW a dragonball MOVIE made by SQUARE STUDIOS???? just an idea...

MovieZoo,Dragonball - a cartoon in real life,6/10,11 April 2009,"Having seen only a couple episodes of Dragonball cartoons, I was not going to expect much. But I was able to see how the characters in the movie and action connected to the cartoon. While it clearly was not a great movie, it was not bad. Moving sometimes too slowly, we get a chance to familiarize with the characters and adapt to the strange humor. The action was so similar to the cartoon, it became obvious the movie was intended to be like the cartoon. So because of that, the movie-making team accomplished its goal.Yun-Fat Chow(Chow Yun-Fat to some) was by far the brightest star. He carried out the cartoonish characterizations of Roshi well enough, that he was so easy to love for his performance. Impish and strong, devilish and charming, I wanted to see more of him. Emmy Rossum was great to watch as Bulma. She truly brought Bulma out of the proverbial inkwell. She was the least cartoonish but I am sure it is because her character was the most respected by the other characters. Sure Roshi, Piccolo and Gohan were highly revered, but in a different way from Bulma. Just ask Roshi who he feared most besides Piccolo. I really enjoyed the chemistry between Bulma and Roshi for the comic sexual tension. Chatwin was good as Goku. I liked his sly, shy and quick sense of humor.The story was not bad. But I think the movie could have been shot a little differently so that special effects in the darker moments would appear more realistic. But then that might have affected the continuity.It appears a lot of the cartoon fans did not like the movie for one reason or another, but I say give it a chance. While the fans deserve to complain, they should also understand how hard it must be to bring cartoons to life. As far as I am concerned Bugs Bunny couldn't do it and Fred Flintstone couldn't do it. But Dragonball succeeded where others have failed.I hear there may be a sequel. If characters are not changed, I'll see it too. Dragonball drags a 6/10 from me."
bearygood9999,really?,1/10,6 April 2009,"I have watched this series all the way from beginning to end, and I like to think of myself as a pretty big fan of Dragonball Z. Unfortunately, my excitement over the fact that they are making this sham of a movie turned quickly to disappointment when I watched the first trailer. Nothing is faithful to the original series. Instead of trying to just put the show onto the big screen for fans and others to enjoy, they have warped it into something that doesn't even closely resemble Dragonball. For the many people out there who don't know what Dragonall is, I feel like this movie is just going to turn them against the franchise In just those few minutes of the preview, there are so many inaccuracies that I almost wanted to cry. Unfortunately, I probably will not go see this movie. Maybe in a few years, after this movie has tanked spectacularly, they will make another that people will actually want to see.

duderoach1229,No merciful God would allow this to happen,1/10,10 April 2009,"I tried to count the many, MANY canonical errors this movie made and I lost count at about ten minutes in. It got to be very concerning for me, as if not a single person in the cast or crew had ever seen a Dragonball episode in their lives. The script is so far gone from the original plot that I can not even imagine what must have gone through the writer's head as he composed this garbage. Surely he did not intend to further the gripping tale so timeless and successful that it sparked a decades-old franchise, so what might have been the reason behind this movie? It is a question that has offered up another question that I can not answer: how different can a licensed piece of work be from the original and still claim to be related?In the original series Goku was just a little kid with a monkey tail having all kinds of wacky adventures searching for the Dragon Balls. Bulma had hair the color of a robin's egg, Roshi was older than the hills, and Chi-Chi was the princess daughter of an enormous beast of a man appropriately named ""The Ox King"". Apparently my inferior Earth logic can not comprehend the neural paths required to transform this series into a teenage high school drama. Teenagers should not even be watching this program anymore! The first episodes to premier in America were in early 1996. Even if you were six years old when you got hooked on this show, where are you now? You are in college, still drinking illegally but well past living with your parents and trying to ""fit in"" with the ""normal crowd"". Even if you ARE in high school, you are five to ten years past watching anything decent on Cartoon Network, much less an episode of Dragonball.My point is that the apparent target audience of this movie is Dragonball fans first and teenage drama fans second. The plot being as far removed from the original story as my car is from the moon, Dragonball fans will hate this movie. They will hate it and everyone associated with it. I am genuinely surprised that in the 8.5 hours (as of this writing) the movie has been out, someone has not been murdered because of the rage it creates among its rabid fan base.If you have never seen Dragonball and have no expectations for this movie, go ahead and see it. You are the only people I could possibly recommend this movie to. However, you will be sorely disappointed by its lack of a driving plot, stunted length, numerous unanswered questions, and the fact that you will see no naked breasts on the screen. As a movie alone, it is still worthless. At no point did I find myself asking, ""I wonder what will happen next,"" but again I might be biased, the aforementioned rabid Dragonball fan that I am.See this movie for yourself if you do not believe me, but please, do not see it in the movie. Download it illegally, for I will not live with myself knowing I furthered the popularity of such a disgraceful piece of trash."
hbarber-80894,Too good for our eyes,10/10,23 December 2019,"Amazing movie, stuck close to the original manga and anime source material (I watched 2 episodes of Dragon Ball GT so I know what I'm talking about). A one of a kind perfect movie with no clear problems in my eyes. Perfect cast and very very accurate representations of the characters in Dragon Balls Z. Amazing CGI and amazing costume work. Deserves best picture and best costume design along with hundreds of other awards. I would give it an 11/10 if I could

treyb389,This is just a shame.,3/10,31 March 2009,"First off, I was not one of the automatic pessimist's that tackled this board at the first sight of the film being produced. I had very high hopes for this movie, and well, it just didn't deliver. Being a huge fan of Dragonball ever since I was 10 years old, I was extremely excited to watch this. At the beginning of the movie, Goku cracks a lot of corny jokes, which really gave me the feel of the anime. Dragonball the anime was always full of terrible jokes so I thought maybe Wong did this on purpose. However, after venturing farther into this movie, I think it was an accident. James Chatwin may be the worst actor in the business after this movie. In some parts he reminded me of William Shatner when he was Captain Kirk on Star Trek. Also, the fight scenes maybe lasted around 2 minutes tops. I mean really Mr. Wong, what the hell were you thinking? It hurts me to say this movie sucked, but there's no better word to describe it. If this movie got a new director and script, then a sequel is very possible. Character development is key in Dragonball, and this movie had none whatsoever. So don't go into this movie with your hopes up. Instead, be optimistic that someone else will pick this script up and re-vamp it for a better, clever, and more violent sequel. It is possible, but right after seeing this horrible adaptation, my hopes are not high."
neil-476,Adequate,6/10,17 April 2009,"I'm not familiar with the manga/anime original source of this movie, but it all seems straightforward enough - seven dragonballs, whatever they are, appear to serve the dual purpose of both facilitating or preventing the end of the world, depending on whether they are in the possession of evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters, Spike from Buffy, slumming it in preposterous green facial prosthetics) or the forces of good - in this case 18-year old High School student Goku (baby faced Justin Chatwin, looking somewhat older than 18). Nobody seems to have spotted that Goku, a white American, has a Japanese grandfather and a Japanese name. Hooray for multiculturalism says I. What follows are assorted martial arts and fantasy sci-fi shenanigans with a dollop of high school romance chucked in, leavened with a comedy martial arts mentor.I like Chow Yun Fat, but his performance here is somewhat extreme - it makes Bulletproof Monk look restrained. He gurns his way through the movie, rolling his eyes, grimacing, pulling faces etc. I'm all in favour of broad comedy, but this isn't so much broad as bloated. Justin Chatwin is personable if forgettable. Emmy Rossum didn't register as the girl I knew from Phantom of the Opera and Day After Tomorrow which, I suppose, is a good thing. James Marsters plainly did it for the money. No-one else registered.Thing is, you don't go to this sort of movie expecting it to be anything other than special effects and martial arts fighting nailed onto some sort of storyline, and that's exactly what you get here. It is functional - no more, no less, and it passes 90 minutes amiably enough and leaves no aftertaste whatsoever."
coach_bef,What a Disappointment !!!,1/10,30 March 2009,"If you think that i am gonna start ranting about how god awful this movie is and why you should not watch it in a theatre then you are wrong because that comes after i tell you why that it sucks so much.This movie is based on the adventures of Son Goku in the world of DragonBall. Toriyama Sama created this epic. he said that this was a manga (Graphic Novel or comic book) that he had been waiting to write for some time. He had already enjoyed success with the popular series Doctor Slump and Aralie Chan. It took 3000 plates(boxes in pages) and 6 years to complete. the series had 148 fights and more than 1 hundred characters.DragonBall was loyal to the fans, in its Anime Master Toriyama himself drew the characters. Even in the Video games the talented Toriyama Sama himself designed the 3D characters which stand true to the source. DragonBall has set a standard of quality that its fans have come to expect from it and when DragonBall Evolution was announced most had a mixed reaction as the previous 2 adaptations had not been very good perhaps due to the budget. FOX put a lot of money into this project that could put Dragonball on the big screen for the world to see but which it did the only problem is that apart from the name Dragonball and its characters at FOX's disposal there is no resemblance to the original series.I had a bad feeling in my gut 9 months ago when we found out that Toriyama Sama has been left out of the project for some ""plot changes"" that was when things started getting ugly and as we found out more about it and now its finally here. Despite of amazing DragonBall concept of Toriyama we get a washed up cliché based typical American teen highschool crap that has been done like a million times and done better. This movie does not satisfy the DragonBall fans or typical movie fans because all FOX wanted was to cash up on the sifi superhero thing that is popular these days. To them DragonBall and all other such manga are just labels that attract an audience they feed off the financial value of it and then just move on. DragonBall has a strong fanbase consisting of people from all ages and parts of the world. FOX has let us all down by giving us this mockery of a classic, alas they could have earned millions if they had done it right but they still can if it is remade with improvements such as a BETTER DIRECTOR and Triyama back on the team so that FOX can really make money off of it which is fine if would just stop this trilogy from happening to us. I score it 1 out of 10"
Edvis-1997,7,7/10,12 December 2020,"Well, I understand it doesn't have amazing graphic and etc. but content(yes, I've watched original dragonball series and loved them) was kind of interesting. I'm not sure why it has such low rating on imdb, it's not a masterpiece but it really deserves more.

Nix_writer867,The beggining of live action remakes,1/10,9 October 2022,"This movie is the reason as to why live action anime are failing. It fails to potray the characters as seen to the priginal anime, and i hated it, because how they potrayed Goku. In the original Dragom ball, Goku was techinically this enthusiatic, funny, charmin and determined worrior, but in this i dont see any charms that made Goku shine in the original Dragon ball. The biggest problem also, as to why live action animes fail is that animes are special as they are, it's more visually pleasing than watching a fricking pain in the a** cosplay so people, stop these live action remakes. It's bad and is betraying the anime it tries to potray."
christophertoddsears,I hate this movie,1/10,3 July 2015,"This movie should have never been made. Thank god Akria Toryimia agreed with us and made Battle of Gods and Resurrection F. Hollywood needs to stop screwing up stuff that is better as it is. Heck this movie should be banned worldwide. Just so everyone knows I love the Dragon Ball series minus this god awful movie. This movie is worse then a lot of remakes I have seen. To me and a lot of other anime fans who love DB/Z/GT this movie makes us want to die or puke it doesn't matter which. I really hate this movie. I would wither watch Barney the dinosaur over this movie. I hate this movie because they messed up Goku. Also because they messed up all the characters and the events.

Maybe that movie did not come out as the best for fans, but it was more than okay and watchable for the rest of us who barely seen 1 or 2 series of the dragonball anime series. The reason that movies like that don't come in 2nd parts coz of those stupid dummies that call themselves ""fans""!

capricorn_darkness,Recast and Remake.,4/10,21 March 2009,"Well, have anybody watch Dragonball Evolution yet? They already show at Malaysia. So I have watch. One thing you should know is Dragonball live-action is not what you guys will expert. Well, it not worth watching at all. Well, who idea to hired James Wong to direct the biggest Japanesse TV/anime/comic of all time.James Wong only good on direct Final Destination series, I love all his Final Destination series, not doubt about that but this Dragonball Evolution. ""Evolution"" I don't know what ""Evolution"" mean in this film. Maybe they just said to make people excited. This cartoon-to-live-action adaptation is a disaster and disappointment.Talk about the cast, well I agree with Fox to cast Emmy Rossum to play Bulma, I know some people will not agree with me, but I think she play that well. Emma got some pretty unic and she totally talented actress out there. The first scene when Bulma(Emmy Rossum) meet Goku(Justin Chatwin), I though she was good, but a little bit... not Bulma in Dragonball character. I'm a bit disappointed that Goku isn't Goku at all and the film so far, it not like the manga at all.The CG in DragonBall Evolution, well that I love. The whole idea was brilliant only when Goku (Justin Chatwin) is battling with Master Roshi (Chow Yun-Fat) and his energy flow inadvertently target Bulma (Emmy Rossum). The punch that Goku make (try to make like TV/manga/anime) well it just rubbish. Hate that scene. The martial arts choreography is a little a bit disappointed to me.This whole movie should put a new title, this movie just have a DragonBall title, plot and character name but it could really be a different movies because I don't know see a similar with Dragonball anime or cartoon."
xyoojfong,Worst movie ever made rate,1/10,23 May 2022,"Worst freaking movie ever! Everything about this movie is wrong and not right! This movie shouldn't even exist!

Kamurai25,Kame-hame-hahahahahahahahahahahaha,4/10,10 June 2020,"Decent enough watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend if you're a fan of ""Dragon Ball"".I was so conflicted after watching this that I binged all 5 seasons of ""Dragon Ball"" (subtitled) just to compare it to the source material, and this movie is full of (message redacted).If I had never heard of anime, then this would actually stand on its own just fine. It has a stellar cast (Yun-Fat Chow, Justin Chatwin, Emmy Rossum, and Jamie Chung), good production value (energy attacks and action), and a relatively good story line.However, being a fan of the anime, this comes dangerously close to being ""Avatar"" in its level of infidelity. This would have been a great story to put into the Dragon Ball universe, but you have to use different characters.I'll avoid going on, in great detail, about everything it left out, and just say that its a problem in the design of the movie: it wasn't meant to be condensed into one movie, its a series for a reason.Give it a watch, it'll either be a good time, or it'll at least get your blood pumping a bit."

Hilbertvankampen,Exceeds the Sipderman-syndrome,1/10,2 May 2009,"Not only did this movie neglect the potential of the comic by casting low level batties to play Hero's (a.k.a the spiderman-syndrome), they went beyond that with this movie, reading a 10 line summary of what dragonball is all about, giving a dude spiky hair and call him ""Goku"" (as if a human could ever bear the weight of the name ""Goku"" and breath during the shoot), painting someone green and call him Piccolo, throw in a couple of droganballs and let them ""fight"" in a way that is a straight disgrace for the dragonball-series. Not only did this movie miss the ""porn-effect"" (think ur watching an intense porn when only listening to the audio during power-ups and actual battle, which should account for 90% of the movie) no, Goku hasn't even been hit in the face or kicked in the stomach grasping for air, i haven't seen anyone being beat to pulp, followed by a series of bonebreaking slams to the ground. The only thing Goky has recovered from.... is a gunshot in the back..... sigh...not to mention the the size of Oozaru, the missing tail and so forth.. When i heard dragonball was going to Hollywood, i made sure i tempered my expectations, but they even made me do a review on IMDb seeing this movie, first time i rated a movie 1 out of 10 and i have seen Krrish and Amazones and Gladiators"
Elvis-Del-Valle,A failed and disappointing attempt for such a popular anime,5/10,26 March 2023,"The film tries to be a summary of what has already been seen in the first series of Dragon Ball, making several changes. Starting from Goku's training with Gohan's grandfather, continuing with the meeting with Bulma, Roshi and Yamcha, until the confrontation with Piccolo. The only good things that stood out are the design of the dragon balls that are good, some action scenes, some effects, Goku's suit that at least looks a bit like the original and at least Piccolo's design does make it look like an alien. Bulma's actress didn't seem too bad to me and Chow Yun-Fat is remarkable, but he falls short in his role as Roshi. There have simply been a lot of changes that make this movie very much derived from Dragon Ball. It had a chance to be something good, since it was produced by Akira Toriyama and Shaolin Soccer's Stephen Chow, but the director chosen was not the one. James Wong is a good filmmaker for having been responsible for The One with Jet Li and the Final Destination saga, but even so, he was not the ideal person to direct this film, since he declared that he had never seen or read anything from Dragon Ball, so I didn't know I was adapting. Unfortunately, this movie is undoubtedly a failed adaptation and a tragedy for an anime as emblematic as Dragon Ball. My rating for this movie is 5/10."
Snootz,It's Dragonball- kinda. What did we expect?,3/10,10 December 2021,"To start, this film suffers from the pox of many such films:Why would the bad guy want to totally destroy Earth in the first place? What, is it in the way of his intergalactic highway construction company? Even if it was ""revenge"", destroy the enemy but keep the very, very valuable planet.Of course, no one ever accused bad guys of sanity. Still, this is a very old, overused, and trite plot line that started the film off on the wrong foot.The second problem is that it's Dragonball. Simplisic-minded fighter video games are not likely to translate to a good story on the main screen. It certainly didn't on this one. The only thing this has going for it is pretty girls... and those can be found in any film. (They likely spent a significant portion of the film's budget on push-up bras.)Beyond that... the goofy and highly-predictable story, the 2D characters, poorly-written script, and barely-there humor only lead to the extremely-predictable during-credits ending. The first 3/4 of the movie were at least somewhat entertaining in a ""solid action adventure without depth"" sort of way... but the final 15 minutes were a significant letdown, with a lazy and juvenile ending.But what did we expect? When we go into a film with ""Dragonball"" or ""Transformers"" in the title, we shouldn't be expecting cerebral. It's going to be pretty much casting fireballs all the way through.Three stars for not making a totally abominable film. No more than that due to the formulaic, predictable and cliche story line. Nothing new here folks."
reedthereaper,Why would someone make this,1/10,9 January 2023,"This has to be one of the worst movies EVER to be made.1.why is goku white
2. Whys his hair looks like that?3. I don't think that's bulma OR roshi
4. Piccolo looks like a poorly designed 90s movie alien
5. Worst plot everIt spits in the face of every DBZ, DBGT,DB and DBS fan.It ruined my childhood and it's an insult to the Saiyan race, martial arts, the turtle school, ACTING, these actors careers, my ears, eyes, brain and my memoryI'd choose the to watch or experience the James Bond Casino Royale Chair scene over and over before I'd EVER watch this movie againWhy'd they make this broWho thought this would be a good movie when they were making it how didn't they know?Don't watch save yourself."
brookenichole-98054,Amazing Action!,4/10,16 January 2021,"Dragonball Evolution is a comical movie. Surprisingly, it made me laugh a lot. The acting was alright, and the story was so messy. A lot of the time I was completely confused at what was happening. Plus, I was not expecting to see Emmy Rossum. The only thing that kept me watching was the action. It was so amazing! I loved the fight scene with Jamie Chung and herself. It was choreographed really well. Yet, this movie in no way reminds me of Dragonball. I have never watched it, but I've seen pictures and some videos.
If the story wasn't so sloppy, this movie could've been great.

VietChu,- 10/10,1/10,26 January 2023,"Dragonball Evolution is a cinematic masterpiece that exceeded all of my expectations. From the stunning special effects to the incredible performances by the entire cast, this film truly captures the spirit of the beloved anime and manga series. The action scenes are intense and exhilarating, and the story is both emotionally powerful and thought-provoking. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and left the theater feeling completely satisfied. If you are a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise, you will not be disappointed. This is a must-see film for anyone who loves action, adventure, and a great story.

danipombo,Dragon Ball Evolution? More like Dragon Ball Degradation.,1/10,9 November 2013,"This movie is based on Dragon Ball, a manga by Akira Toriyama. What they makers of the movie basically did was create a totally new story using the same characters of Dragon Ball ruining all the greatness of what Dragon Ball really was. They even modified the original characters changing their appearance, their background, and the way they originally behaved. Example: The original Goku is Cheerful, courageous, adventurous, wild, naive, loving, caring, strong. His grandpa raised him when he was a baby but died before Goku was't even a teenager, so Goku had to raise himself pretty much, in the middle of the jungle where he lived, very far from civilization. In the movie however, Goku, is not cheerful, lives in civilization, goes to school, and gets bullied by kids. This is only one of the many examples of derangement from the original story. Here are more Examples. Original: Goku throws energy blasts. Movie: Goku uses air bending techniques. Original: Master Roshi is old and bald, powerful, perverted, lives in a house in the middle of an island with his companion turtle. Movie: Master Roshi is young, not perverted, lives in the middle of New York, the turtle doesn't exist. Original: Goku travels through the air with the ""Flying Nimbus"", a yellow cloud he sits on and flies with. Movie: The ""Flying Nimbus"" doesn't exist. Original: There are Wild Dinosaurs. Movie: Dynos are extinct.The point is, watch the original if you haven't, because it's awesome and totally different. And then judge for yourself."
opticuscro,the disaster of all disasters,1/10,7 October 2022,"Oh yes, I remember this highly anticipated film. Everyone was impatiently waiting for this, especially Dragonball fans. When it came out and when I looked at it, the disappointment I felt was something indescribable. Acting at the amateur level tis very below average. All characters are generic without personality without enthusiasm. Visible attempts to insert some funny scenes that are not funny at all, forced commedy. A romantic relationship, if we can call it that, was inserted purely to exist in the story. The plot is characterless, uninterestingly complicated and moves too quickly without explanation every now and then, lots of unexplained things, sketchy with lots of holes in the story. The only good thing in this movie is the visual effects, I must to admit, but that's not nearly enough to save the rest of the film.

djaligator13,One big think is here,1/10,14 January 2010,"First I want to say. Where is the evolution in this movie? Goku is already in a city at school and wanted girls not martial arts. This is very stupid they made character awful ""Goku and girls"" :)). Kame->Master Roshi is in center of ""lake"" in a big city and in a awful house. Then all movie was talk searcing and so on when at final with Picolo fight that was just an not a big effect then movie is finish and 85 min | 100 min (uncut version) of your life for nothing. To bad they done this to the Dragon Ball anime that was amazing anime and it is today. We hope that it will be another movie that is will be a very good one as the anime.

kmanion1470,worst interpretation ever,1/10,28 May 2009,"I just finished watching the anime version of both dragon ball and dragon ball z. I loved them. They both were imaginative and interesting. I figured before I would watch this movie I should finish the series. I think I was wrong. The movie didn't follow any of the original ideas. I only got about 20 minutes in before I finally turned it off. None of the characters were what I expected either. Ridiculous if you ask me. I hope if the make another db movie they follow the anime series and not add or change anything. They have ruined a good thing. Spoiler...Why is Goku eighteen when Piccolo arrives. What is with the solar eclipse too? And Goku didn't know a thing about the dragon balls, Bulma told him. They met when he was like 11 too. None of the movie follows what the creators of the series wrote. It's stupid. Oh and another thing, why is Gohan alive?!?!"
The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,So bad it's ALMOST good...sort of.,3/10,11 April 2009,"Well, if there were two movies I was worried about as far as ruining my childhood, it would be ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" and this bad boy, which, while it's much, MUCH better than the aforementioned abomination, is still pretty tough to watch in a serious way, as it's barely passable as unintentional camp fun. I don't even know if that's a compliment or not.I can honestly say that I wasn't disappointed by this 'film', but I can't decide if it's because my expectations were so low, or because I actually liked the campy feel of it, versus the ""Street Fighter"" blowup that tried WAY too hard to be serious. Thankfully, there at least appears to be some effort put into this one, as the special effects aren't laughably bad (nor are they good, especially the creature effects *gags*), and the characters are as endearing as they are cheesy.Justin Chatwin is probably one of my least favorite actors, and I found his Goku to be rather bland with only flashes of the geeky hero he really is. Chatwin plays the role by the book, never letting go of the script pages enough to make the character his own. Emmy Rossum gives the cheesiest performance in the film after Chow Yun Fat (though he was supposed to be like that), and it's kind of stunning considering the wonderful talent this young actress possesses. James Marsters is stereotypically bad as Piccolo, who is so absent from the film that it's kind of sad. I don't blame Marsters for the failure of Piccolo, however, as he is horribly written.The film features numerous special effects, but doesn't overdo it, as they aren't that great. It wasn't a distraction or anything though, so it doesn't get any points off here. The film also has a very rushed, compact, and empty finale. Another point I want to make is that there weren't really any scenes that stood out to me besides the Goku/Chi Chi scenes (which were actually kind of sad, because Jamie Chung was trying so hard to make them work, and Justin Chatwin just...wasn't).""Dragonball Evolution"" definitely falls into the category I made for the ""Twilight"" film: so bad, it's almost good. It's decent campy fun that retains a little bit of the spirit of the television show in the transition to modern times (though not enough to make a big impact), and I didn't feel like I wasted my time. However, I'd go ahead and wait for the DVD or catch it online. I'm not upset because I didn't have to pay...Oh the joys of working at a movie theater..."
dominicdanielewicz,Why you should NOT read reviews until after seeing a film...,7/10,8 May 2009,"OK, hands up, I love the Dragon Ball series, I have practically all the episodes and can pretty much say I know it like the back of my hand. Does this mean I am a hard-core fan who wants to see an EXACT replica? Maybe but then again, the only reason we tend to watch a thing again is because there is always something new to experience Let's put it this way, I have watched the series about three times over, (that's a lot of episodes and films) and in a break of about four years each. The only reason I have done this is because of ""nostalgia"" the good old days when I was in secondary school and had nothing to worry about, and/or because something on Wikipedia or god knows where else tell me to look of for this or that in an episode. I wouldn't watch the series over and over because I would get BORED if it was the same thing over and over. And so would you. You know that's true, even if it comes down to the Matrix trilogy, spaghetti westerns and so on. You would just ruin your love of those films, sort of when you get addicted to a certain type of food only to feel sick of it for the rest of your life.This is why, there HAD to be something different about this film. There would be NO POINT in just green lighting something that has already been done, because I guarantee you even hardcore fans would turn around and say ""ZOMG that's soooo boring I've seen that already"" – you just can't win these days.Oh, on the side note, it's not the Director you should be having a go at if you don't like the plot, hairdo's or set, it should really be the Producers – these are the ones who have FULL control of the project and who have the final say about how the film looks, feels and tells. The Director's job is really to just do what they say and make sure everything runs smoothly. It's as sad as that on a Hollywood set, unless you're Mr. Coppolla on the set of ""Tetro"" where you DO have control (read the latest edition of Empire magazine if you have no idea what I mean).Right so, kinda went of on a rant there but anyway, you now know who you should be having a go at and why things are different, though there is more to say about that. The plot could be different because the producers might have decided they wanted to target a wider audience and in order to do that, some things had to be changed. It's a business at the end of the day. And MOST importantly because this is an ADAPTATION. That means the film is LOOSELY based on the original series and so the studio can do what the hell they want with it. Sad fact, but yes, they can. Harry Potter anyone? Remember all those complaints? And yet it still rolls in the millions ANYWAY onto the film now, and why you should NOT read reviews before watching it. Simply put, it's because people who have no grasp of the term ""critical analysis"" convince everyone that the film is really bad, and then this spreads around the globe until it's ""cool and hip"" to be a hater. And if you love the film you should be sentenced to death by rocks. That's how ridiculous it is. Nobody knows why they hate the film (Even those who haven't watched it) and its people like me who suffer. The cast was pretty good I think. Chatwin played Goku really well I believe so hats of to him, Reminded me of the teenage Gohan when he was at school Master Roshi, and Chi Chi were also pretty well cast however something felt jarring with Emmy Rossum (who I love) as Bulma and Joon Park as Yamcha. I felt as if Emmy Rossum had never seen the original series and as if Joon Park was trying too hard, though this could be the language barrier. Piccolo seemed a bit too pretentious for my liking, but then again I feared that ever since James Masters compared him to something from Shakespeare's writings The sets were pretty cool, and the special effects were quite nice, although the gorilla bit made me cringe slightly.Overall, the story wasn't that much different from the originals. I mean, come on, it's not like Piccolo was now a white boy fighting against a robot called Goketa who married a blade of grass with fart bending techniques. It was rather close I would say, and so I have to congratulate the producers on not changing things too drastically. The reason for the seven is because the film was enjoyable, I really enjoyed it for what it was supposed to be, a fun quirky action film. It made me smile and I really hope there is another one (which looks like that isn't going to happen, but then again, look at HellBoy II – there's always hope). If there special effects were better and the acting was a bit better in parts I mentioned, I'm sure this could have done really well.So yeah, don't read reviews from people on here who have titles such as ""Dnt watch dis film"" or even from newspapers, because those reporters tend to be snobby. Go watch a film for yourself first with a fresh mind, and I guarantee you will enjoy it more, or at least come out with your own, ORGANIC opinion. It would save me having to write such long reviews as this one Thanks for readingIf you did!"
TheHande,A good but rushed adaptation,7/10,13 September 2009,"Dragonball Evolution attempts to bring the cartoony and over-the-top martial arts/fantasy/sci-fi manga to the big screen. Mostly the transition has been handled well. The film takes considerable liberties with the source material but considering the over-all length of the original manga this is to be expected and the changes work on their own.Characters are given adequate introductions and the film also features plenty of comedy to even out the fighting and action. However, the film suffers from scenes rushing by way too quickly and the villains for one are not given many character moments. It really feels like the film makers could have taken the time and textured the film's plot better before the inevitable CG-heavy final fight sequence which was thankfully handled very well.Despite some rather sharp contrasts with the original characters' appearances all the actors seem to fit their roles well, especially Justin Chatwin who is finally allowed to channel the bad ass towards the end of the film. The only character whose transition wasn't perhaps done as well as I hoped was Shen Long who pops up only near the very end.Between the comedy and action, the inherent entertainment value of the piece Dragonball Evolution is well done adaptation of the world famous manga. If the sequel ever materializes I hope they take time to work on the film's pacing rather than just slapping on some more characters from the manga."
richardblake314,Richard Blake should've had a larger role,10/10,28 April 2018,"Some of the most talented actors are supporting roles in this film. I met Mr. Blake in Japan at the premiere of this film and have followed his career ever since! Also, Justin Chatwin is the most perfectly cast Goku there could be.

soagg,Good but not great!!,6/10,12 March 2009,"Well I am a huge fan of this franchise growing up with Goku and Gohan. This was really interesting to see the characters come alive.Bad Points: 1. What is with the sets??? Really poor direction and the set decoration is totally weird. You get the feeling of a cheap B grade movie all the time.2. The actors try really hard to save the movie and in the attempt sometimes overdo it. Especially Chow Yun Fat, didn't expect that such a good actor will not be able to handle Roshi's role (which is very funny) but here we get only a few smiles that's all. 3. The end sequence though good ends up pretty soon. Also the transformation does not last much.(You will know once you see the movie)Good Points: 1. The powers and the dragon are cool as usual and with the characters build so well there is no doubt that lot of people will like this movie.2. The flow of the story is true to the Series and there is a hope that the future movies will have more.3. The pace of the movie is good and the ones who are knew will for now be happy with the action and the speed of the movie. 4. The character changes to Goku makes him more real and the acting is surprisingly good from an actor with very less movies under his belt Justin Chatwin did justice to his role for most of the part.I will give it 6 because of the look and feel of the movie.The movie is good overall but do not expect a Peter Jackson's styled masterpiece here :)"
BigGuy,Hilarious!,3/10,11 April 2009,"I was at the movie theater trying to figure out which of the new releases to see. I saw the poster for Dragonball Evolution, and it had Chow Yun-Fat's face on it. That tipped the scales and I paid my money and took my chances.The movie starts with the traditional martial arts theme of an old master beating up on a young student. Actually it started with a slow motion zoomed in picture of a guy sweating, then the old guy beat him up.From there it was kind of downhill, but super funny at the same time. In many ways it reminded me of watching the power rangers shows (which came out when I was in college). A bunch of pretty people, acting incredibly earnestly, but coming across as funny instead.In terms of quality, the high point was the first scene with Chow Yun-Fat. He has the kind of physical charisma that is utterly captivating. Later, at the cinematic denouement, instead of captivating the audience, the audience broke out laughing.The problem with the movie, was there wasn't a clear audience in mind (except obvious fans of Dragonball). There were scenes which clearly had more adult audiences in mind (nothing explicit, but some innuendo), but the overall maturity level of the rest of the script was for elementary school students. With enough high school angst thrown in to try to appeal to the young teens.All that being said, most of the people left the movie in good spirits. Not because the movie was good, but because they had a good laugh."
Damianroroz,worst movie ever,1/10,2 November 2010,"They almost destroyed dragon ball. I can just watch the first 15 minutes... Everything is wrong in the movie... I don't know where the 100 million went to... I've seen better effects in non budget amateur movies. Goku a teenager? Are we crazy? Goku's never been a teenager, Goku never went to school either... And who decided to take out Krillin? Whatever, this could be minor problems if everything else was OK, but is not the case. Boring direction, cinematography and art direction... They just wanted some money and they made the movie without watching or reading anything of dragon ball. Hollywood is having a bad time, that proves it.In conclusion this isn't a movie, is an abortion. We'll just have to wait until Fox takes this project to someone with a brain (this could take 20 years...).

stf92,Oh my god...,1/10,6 September 2009,"Dude, the best thing about this movie was Bulma's cleavage. Goku didn't have a tail, HOW DID HE TURN INTO THE MONKEY!!! It was nothing like the show, which was the most popular anime series ever made. It's like they made up their own story and put Dragonball in the title just so they could make money. They did not follow the story line at all. The acting was absolutely terrible. Kamehameha is not a form of air bending or a way to heal people. It is a form of attack Goku uses. The visuals were ridiculously cheesy. The dialog was kind of bad. Scratch that, VERY bad. I hope someone can make a movie and remake the actual series detail by detail. I mean, like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings did not include every detail, but it follows the story line all the way through, but just left a few details, maybe characters out, so it would not be five hours long. This movie just sucks, don't bother watching unless you just want to complain about how bad it sucks and how it had nothing to do with the anime series. Save your money. Don't watch it."
maxmages,kamehame..... Na,2/10,17 April 2018,"Imagine a completely Mediterranean-winning genetic high school drama movie before the second half wizard introduces.
And this movie is called Harry Potter Evolution: that would not be the worst movie in the world but the biggest disappointment in the world.
The people who know the book feel kicked and sad because they do not get what they expected.
And the people who just wanted to watch a cool movie feel betrayed and bored because they did not get what they expected.
This movie is by far the worst thing Americans have done to Japanese culture in this century.

worldsworstwryter,Wow,1/10,8 March 2022,"This really is as bad as everyone says it is. The story is awful, the characters have no development, the effects are shoddy, and the action is boring, and that's all without mentioning the acting.There's really nothing to redeem it, but even that doesn't get across just how bad this is. If you watch it, your face will be stuck scrunched up in pain and disgust for the entire running time.

titopejaten-1,Just watch it,7/10,3 April 2009,"If you like movies like Mortal Kombat, D.O.A Death or Alive, you should watch this I think is quite entertaining. There are nothing special with this movie but at this time with all good action movie is still waiting to come out this is worth a trip to a theater near you. What else can I say so my comment is pass the minimum lines and can be post. If you have little nephew, or son or brother between ages 7 - 12 they will like this movie, bring them along so you can enjoy more as they comment or pointing to screen. Also on the plus side the fight scene is much much better than Charlie's Angel although that not say much. Chow Yun Fat certainly make the movie more alive but I wish he have more part in it.PS: should there be a sequel, I will watch it

van-kenn,"Awful Movie, Nothing like the anime",1/10,9 April 2009,"I've been watching the cartoon for about 15 years. I have watched all episodes over and over again and never get bored.This movie is boring. Suck. Nothing like the story. Characters are ugly. Goku is not a skinny white American boy! Goku doesn't go to high school. Goku does not chicken out a fight. Goku loves to fight! What the hell is wrong with the director? Anyone can direct a movie and make it suck. He needs to be shot. I'm serious, guy took a good anime and make it hell. Even Power Rangers is better then this movie! Why not have the director of X-men or Spiderman make this movie? They really screwed it up badly on this one. The director needs to get fired!!! badly!!! omg!!! this movie is a complete joke.

Firetears_X,Umm... It had nice fight scenes!,4/10,18 April 2009,"I won't lie. I am a Dragonball fan. I've followed the show from the very beginning right to the end. I remember running home from school everyday just so I can catch DBZ when it aired. That said, my beef with the movie is NOT because it didn't follow the anime closely. I'm not a purist when it comes to these things and I enjoy quality in whichever form I can get it.The movie, for the first half was pretty fun. I liked seeing the modernized version of DB with Goku as a teen, dealing with high school bullies and all. It was pretty entertaining but unfortunately it only lasts for the first 15 or so minutes. After that the movie becomes a chaotic fast track.The movie moved too fast for me. It didn't really take the time to stop and take a whiff of fresh air. The gang is always on the move and it ultimately turns out to be a lot of crazy, inexplicable mess. Not to mention that it was extremely cheesy and too cartoony sometimes. It might've been nice for the little kids but those of us who grew up watching DBZ are grown now.The characters all turn out to be one-dimensional. There's NO character development from anyone's perspective. Goku may have had a tad bit of development but not as much as you'd expect for the main character. Especially when you consider the fact that the movie was all about ""Being who you are inside"" and all that corny mumbo-jumbo.The acting was... god. Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung were the only ones who seemed natural. Emmy Rossum had great facial expressions but her voice seemed too animated for me. She didn't have any chemistry with the rest of the cast and sometimes I thought she may have been too uncomfortable. And DO NOT get me started on Joon Park. He was HORRIBLE. He reminded me of a surfer dude from a 70s movie(you know, when the acting was SUPPOSED to be campy). And as a Buffy fan, I gotta say that James Marsters was upsetting. He obviously didn't put himself into the role.The directing was lazy. Straight and simple. The only time it seems the director put forth the extra effort was during a fight scene. Everything else was... blah. But, you should expect that from a movie where there's no effort in development. Bulma and Yamcha's ""relationship"" came from nowhere. One minute they were arguing and the next minute they were having a one-on-one. Ridiculous.Overall, it was an EPIC fail. It was just a fail."
goddamnit79,It is what it is,10/10,15 February 2020,"Im sorry. But it's Dragonball Z. Never was a fan as a kid. And definitely not now. The movie shows it for what it is. Haters going to hate. Therefore its a solid 10. Perfect adaptation. Hahaha

jebyvyson,And I thought The Last Airbender was blend...,1/10,15 October 2019,"I remember seeing this as a kid and I can see issues with the movie before even knowing what it is. I'm a fan of Dragonball Z, probably my number 1 favorite anime show of all time. Year pass and I came to the realization that this so called ""adaptation film"" is a piece of utter garbage. Heck, maybe worst than The Last Airbender, at least that film has a simple story from the cartoon series. The action is terrible, the visual effects is blend as hell, the only good character in that movie was Master Roshi, everything else is a cliché executed horribly. If The Last Airbender was the cake, this movie is the cherry on top.

bennyhagen,Isn't worth the fuzz.,1/10,22 September 2009,"It is actually quite astonishing that the movie has literally nothing to offer, I mean, after all, it is based on Dragonball, it must have been really hard to eradicate every aspect of it's awesomeness while filling the hole with so much stupid crap. Further on conversation challenges C movie flicks like Comodo vs. Cobra, the story is bogus, unmotivated actors behave like wind-up dolls, the action is totally lame and forget about the rest too.Questions, like how could this happen and so on are probably already answered and in the end this is just one of the worse movies of all time and will be forgotten forever soon.It could have been worse though. It could have been somewhat better, feature one or two elements of the anime, pleasing one or the other kid. It could have been making money, encouraging the producers to do sequels and so on. But now we have the chance, that somewhere in the future someone will come along and do a reboot. And that one will probably be an interesting piece as it will really need to deliver. Maybe the producers will even hire a good director. Let's look forward to that and just not talk about this ever again.0/10"
JimD73,Honestly better than expected (thats not saying much),4/10,14 January 2010,"As a fan of the show in my youth, I once upon a time thought a live-action DragonBall movie would be awesome. I was twelve, please forgive me. Upon seeing the first trailers for this movie, I knew how wrong I was. Fantasy elements such as those in DragonBall just didn't seem to work in a live-action setting. Now that DBE is available for rental, I had to pick it up just to see how bad it came out. I am legitimately astonished. While DBE is certainly a bad movie, it somehow manages to avoid being terrible, which is more credit than I ever thought I'd give it.DragonBall Evolution is far from faithful to the source material, although nostaligia certainly was evoked. The dark lord Piccolo has managed to break out of his seal, and is hunting for the DragonBall's such that he can wish himself back into power. One of these dragonballs belongs to Goku, a geeky teenager who lives with his grandpa and trains in the martial arts, including some wacky airbending stuff and the word ""ki"". When Piccolo kills Goku's grandfather, Goku and fellow dragonball holder Bulma go on the run to find Master Roshi and stop Piccolo. Oh, and for Goku to woo hot fighter chick ChiChi.Certain elements from the old cartoons come across very well with live actors. Bulma's motorcycle-in-a-capsule is certainly quite awesome. But for every plus, there's five problems. Goku in high-school is almost insulting to the fans. The airbending techniques come across as a little too sci-fi since the world is made to look a little more realistic than in the cartoons (we accepted it there in a world where a dog was a police captain).Some of the biggest problems lie in the characters. Chow Yun Fat ostensibly brings some level of respect to the movie, but its one of his worst performances. In one moment where he celebrates a victory, he acts like Roshi straight out of the cartoon, something that doesn't work in live-action. Emmy Rossum really should be getting better roles than Bulma, and Bulma herself is made more action-oriented to fit in with the boys (although she's the only protagonist to play with guns). Joon Park is annoying as all hell as Yamcha, a Korean thief who talks like a surfer. Jamie Chung is definitely the hotter than anyone would have imagined ChiChi, but since when was ChiChi a fighter? Chatwin is decently likable, although the implications of a white Goku are a little unfortunate.Action is of course what the movie is about, seeing as the series prided itself on five-episode long fight sequences. The beginning scenes are quite awful, such as Goku's fight with high school bullies, with overuse of slow-mo. After that, the fights are a little more fluid and enjoyable, although far from memorable. But hey, we get to see Chow Yun Fat beat up the kid from War of the Worlds, which almost makes it worth it.In spite of how easy it is to rip on, DragonBall Evolution was much more enjoyable than I expected. There's a lot of groaners, but less than I expected. Maybe its just low expectations, but I got a lot more out of DBE than I expected. Granted, I expected it to be a zero-star affair, and it managed a whole two. Good for it. But from now on, realise the limitations of adapting cartoons to live action. This movie will be too out-there for non-fans, and the fans will absolutely hate it. Moderate fans looking for nostalgia, such as myself, are really the sole audience for this."
mergatroid-1,I liked it,5/10,1 August 2009,"It's too bad there are so many bad reviews of this movie. I thought it was as good of a representation of the anime as could be jammed into a movie. The original story revolves around a kid (Goku) who's grandfather dies. He meets a girl named Bulma and they go off looking for the dragonballs.For the movie they decided to start with Goku turning 18. The story is similar in that he meets Bulma and they go off searching for the dragonballs. Of course, since the anime takes 50 episodes to give you such a small amount of story, they have to sacrifice quite a lot to fit a complete story into a movie length. They introduce a few characters that, in the anime, don't come along until later in the story.That is also acceptable if only to introduce a few characters that might be around in later movies. They also changed Goku's transformation from being when the moon comes out to occurring during a solar eclipse. This is really no major change, and allows the story to move along. (Rather like having Spiderman shoot webs from his wrists rather than Peter Parker creating webshooters).It's too bad there are so many negative reviews. I thought the acting was very well done. The direction was fine, the story moved along. The script was good, the overall production was on par with what you would expect from a company like 20th Century Fox and the effects were well done.I have to say that I, having seen and enjoyed 99% of all the Dragonball animes that were available in Canada throughout the years, was entertained throughout this entire movie.What do I think they could have done better? Well, I thought the makeup on Piccolo could have been more true to the anime. I didn't see any reason for them to change his looks other than some artist or producer thinking his vision of what Piccolo should look like was better than the original authors, which is nonsense. It would have been nice if they could have stuck more closely to the original story, but then how many adults would have bought a movie about a little kid with amazing martial arts powers? Not very many, that's for sure. They could have just started the movie further along into the story, but that might make them have to spend too much time on introducing all the characters.I think all the people who gave this movie a bad review should go back and watch it again. Only, this time keep in mind all the compromises that had to be made to keep the average viewer watching and interested, and not just the fans of the original show.I can come up with titles of 100 shows that I thought were worse than this movie but received better reviews.I enjoyed watching this movie as much as I enjoyed watching the original series.******EDIT******* Man, I really must have been high when I watched this the first time. I decided to watch it again, and, wow, what a stinker. I mean, I have seen lots worse movies (no, really, lots). Overall the production values here were OK, but the story was pretty screwed up, and the kid they got to play Goku wasn't exactly a great actor. The scene at the end where the climactic battle takes place was not very well done.I hope they give this another try, with a better director and producer, better casting and a story that sticks to the original a little better. The really charming thing about the original Dragon Balls what the little kid, Goku, beating the crud out of so many big evil monsters and people, and how hot Bulma was. They need to capture that charm if they want to make a successful movie."

TheStuffer,Worst movie,1/10,24 April 2009,"This is the worst movie that I've ever seen, watching a dog humping someones leg is even more exciting. I've never seen such a bad anime 2 live-action. It's like Dragonball and some Dragonball Z eps mash-up. This movie gives the anime series a bad name. When I saw the dragon I thought it was a lizard on steroids who fell in a can of gold-paint. And what happened to Goku's best friend Krillin, he wasn't even mentioned in the whole movie. And how the f*ck can Goku transform in Oozaru when he doesn't even have tail and I didn't know that Piccolo could control a Oozaru. The Oozaru in this movie they can use it for a new Wolfman movie because it looked more like a wolf then a ape, and the Oozaru in this movie isn't a GIANT ape, no, it's a TINY ape, Oozaru isn't much bigger then a master Roshi."
jms_girouard,Underrated very faithful adaptation of Manga/comic,10/10,22 March 2009,"The film was a very good book/cartoon/ to Live/action adaptation. Starting off, the point of the name of the film ""evolution"" means basically a step up from it being a straight adaptation of the kids cartoon show towards making it more for a younger/teen audience hence ""Goku in high school"" The beginning of the film has such a Dragonball feel to it when you see Goku with the sweat dropping from his face and then giving the signature ""Goku"" look in the cartoon. The scene also is very ""cartoonish"" too with Grandpa Gohan's lines ""prepare to eat dirt!"" and the fighting is also very impressive even having a very ""dragonball"" feel it to as well. Justin Chatwin has such the face of Goku it's not even funny as does James Marsters with the face of Piccolo hence perfect casting choice for the both of them. I could say more about how they gave tribute to the cartoon and Manga too! (listed below). However there could have been much more fighting with Goku and Piccolo. The most impressive thing to me was the look and feel of the Dragonball world they created for the film that really matched or gave tribute to the cartoon and Manga..There definitely is more and I'll add more when I watch it again. The film even played like watching a full-length episode on the TV!!..The film also had a very beautiful and impressive score that had a feel of ""hope"" and ""faith"" when watching it. Even the film had a great Buddhist message in it too matching the Manga/cartoon.. ""In order to become One, I must be two"" In order to become ""One with your soul"" you must become One with the Divine ""Yin-Yang"" The Divine Mother and Father ""Creator"" of the Universe. By becoming ""ONE"" with them you transcend the opposites of the your soul and are now born again in them as now a ""Buddha child"" of the Divine. The creator of the Manga and cartoon Akira Toriyama created it with this Buddhist principle and message since he really has a great admiration and respect to the religion of Buddhism..Definitely a great message for children to have great faith to overcome all evils of the world and follow God and become ""pure"" and ""holy"" in Him and remain ""ONE"" in Him as His Child of Divine Love..Here are more of things the filmmakers did to tribute to Manga/cartoon1. Master Roshi's home being on an island in the city tributing the cartoon of it being on a island in the ocean2. Piccolo's ship hover-craft 3. The World Martial Arts Tournament4. The signature ""Goku"" look Justin Chatwin makes in the one scene in the beginning5. The fight scene in the beginning having a very Dragonball feel with Goku and Gohan fighting and balancing on two ropes6. Gohan being taught by Roshi7. Roshi teaching Goku about his powers8. Yamcha being a Desert Raider9. Bulma's hair and her working for her father ""Capsule Corporation""10. Capsule Corporation11. Bulma's magic capsule pill device 12. 7 Dragonballs gives the beholder one ""perfect"" wish from Shenron 13. Dragonballs created by 7 Mystics to keep world in balance and at peace symbolizing how ""Kami"" created them for the same purpose14. The look of the Dragonball world created in the film looking very similar to the cartoon and comic 15. Piccolo creating minions to help him get Dragonballs 16. Goku becoming Ozaru when moon is full17. Goku using Kamehameha 18. Piccolo searching for the Dragonball by destroying cities19. Goku having a relationship with Chi-chi 20. Rice-Cooker Evil containment wave21. Goku eating more than regular people22. Goku's hair23. Both Piccolo and Goku (Saiyans) coming from another world who wrecked destruction on Earth and other planets long ago 24. Goku's Supernatural Powers ""Qi"" 25. Bulma's Radar Device 26. Goku's Grandpa teaching him about his powers27. Goku coming from another planet and being raised by his Grandfather28. Sufi Norris ""Master Mutaito"" 1st using Evil Containment Wave to trap Piccolo in Rice cooker ""Master Mutaito"" 29. The end climax scene with Roshi using concealment wave on Piccolo trying to trap him in the rice cooker30. The volcano scene with Goku trying to find one of the Dragonballs tributing how Goku in the Manga searched dangerous places to find it too31. Mai being Piccolo's servant who helps him try to find Dragonballs32. The Dragon Temple to try to summon/awaken Shenron with the 7 Dragonballs33. Gohan speaking to Goku in the Spirit trying to warn him and fight Piccolo using his Qi..tributing Kami and the good gods of the Spirit world guiding Goku and helping him become a warrior throughout DB and DBZ34. Goku in signature uniform fighting Piccolo at the end and defeating him with the most powerful Dragonball move from the Manga/cartoon and using the phrase ""Kamehameha"" 35. Paozu City tributing Mount Paozu where Gohan raised Goku36. 7 Mystics tributing ""Kami"" and Master Mutaito 1st using the Evil Containment Wave ""Mafuba"" to contain/seal Piccolo in rice cookie thousands of years ago37. Roshi liking ""Hot"" girls 38. Roshi dying after using Mafuba on Piccolo39. The Stone Temple tributing Orin Temple40. Goku carrying heavy weight to become stronger while Roshi teaching himIf you think they didn't tribute or weren't faithful to the cartoon ""King Piccolo Saga"" then after reading this hopefully you changed your mind."
asim_ali-101,Not the best movie but not worse either,8/10,19 March 2009,"I have been waiting to watch this movie since I heard that 20th century fox were making this it.I didn't really care about who they cast in the movie or who was directing the movie, all I really cared about was that this movie should not be disappointing and after seeing the movie for myself and not judging it by what other people have said in their reviews I can say it's a wicked movie.There are some points in the movie that I can say need to be redone but overall the story was catchy and the action even if it was short it was good. The most disappointing thing about the film was the misuse of the oozaru and the short timing of the end battle between goku and piccolo.Overall the movie was good and it kept me entertained and still I think it was worth the wait the movie soundtracks and music are excellent and I think the cast did a pretty good job playing their characters, the best performance has to be Chow Yun Fat, he did a awesome job as master roshi and roshi kept me laughing quite a bit and also Joon Park did a wicked job as Yamcha, he sounds just like the cartoon character which was amazing. Justin Chatwin try to do his best as goku and he did make me laugh a bit but he was just too serious and the Goku I know is funny and carefree.Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung were good as Bulma and Chi - Chi and James Marster made a wicked piccolo but his time in the movie was short and kind of reminded me of Vemon's amount of time in spider-man 3 but piccolo was another good thing about the movie.This movie is not going to be the best movie of the year or win any Oscars but it's still fun to watch and enjoyable and I seriously recommend this movie to true dragonball fans who actually know the meaning of adaptation and don't mind a bit of change in something you liked for years.My rating 8 out of 10"
films-22537,Perspective of a non Dragonball Z fan,3/10,16 March 2020,"Full disclosure, I'm not a fan of the comics or cartoon, it's seems like a serial in which you need to know all of it to enjoy any of it. Much like the one episode of the cartoon I tried to watch, with this movie I didn't know if I should take none of it seriously since it feels silly or all of it seriously since the world is at stake? The logic is very farfetched and it's hard to know when you're supposed to turn your brain off or pay attention to what you're watching, so I was lost a few times. Overall though, I could see this fitting into the movie rotation of a 6-8-year-old boy. However, its far too generic, derivative and homogenized to be enjoyable to anyone else, especially fans of the source material.

davidna75,Amazing how Hollywood feels like the main characters have to be Caucasians for originally Asian content,1/10,15 May 2009,"Thinking of a recent example (other than this one) - SpeedRacer.Are there no Asian actors that can speak English? Given a huge sum of money to make a movie, the first thing they should do is find a good group of talent to make the movie, no?Instead, what we got is terrible screen-writing, obnoxious/clichéd wardrobes and on top of that the worst directing job I've seen in recent days. And that's not to mention the terrible CGI/editing throughout the movie.Multi-colored fire = energy? How sad.This movie's producers really need to benchmark successful attempts like (discounting the obvious Batman) X-Men, HellBoy, Matrix, OldBoy for transitioning from anime presentation to live action presentation.And please, change the director (and most of the crew) if there will actually be a sequel/prequel/rework of this."
talarisw,"A live action/adventure film loosely based on the classic dragon-ball magna, where Goku and his friends must stop the evil Piccolo from collecting the 7 magic dragon-balls.",8/10,11 August 2014,"I defiantly think people are way too critical of this movie. I'm a big fan of the original dragon-ball and dragon-ball z stories and I found this film to be enjoyable. I don't think this film is suppose to be an straight up adaption of dragon-ball or dragon-ball z but more of a loosely based on adaption. A movie that's based on dragon-ball but still it's own movie. The visual look and the tone of the movie was good. The only problem I had with the plot is that we saw Goku going to school, which he didn't in the original dragon-ball and I think it would've been better to keep it that way and that Krillin, Goku's best friend didn't appear here. But I found the plot to be pretty good and true to dragon-ball. it begins with Goku living with Grand pa Gohan and he's killed and considering that in a movie we don't have a lot of time so we can't really follow Goku growing up like we did in the original story so I'm fine with them starting with the Piccolo saga. I thought the guy playing Goku, Justin Chatwin did a fine job. Later we meet Bulma, the 2nd most important character in the series. I like the actress who played her, Emmy Rossum and it felt like Bulma from the series. I liked Master Roshie here but it was odd that he looked younger then Grand pa Gohan but Roshie was the one who trained him. And I like the references to him being a pervert but not in a bad way just that he likes nudie magazines and is always trying to get a peek. Yamache fits well into the story and they give us that Bulma, Yamcha relationship. And we get Chichi. The main villain is Piccolo played by James Marsters from Buffy the vampire slayer(who played one of my favorite villains, Spike the vampire). I thought he made for a really good Piccolo. I like how Goku turning into a giant monkey worked well into the story's climax in a way I didn't expect. The dragon-balls looked good but were a little too small for my taste and it was nice seeing the Sheron dragon. Overall I feel like this movie is not a pure adaption of the dragon-ball magna but more of a lose adaption as the title suggest it's something a little different I found this film to be enjoyable I really don't think it's this awful movie people say it is. I don't think it was trying to be dragon-ball or dragon-ball z but a lose adaption of them but I found it be a good(maybe not great) live action film loosely based on my favorite anime."
slyth,Why Would These Evil F**kers Ruin My Favorite Childhood Show? Why God? Why?,1/10,30 March 2009,"I don't need to see it to know I'll hate it.1.

I'm also fairly sure there won't be a flying nimbus or a power pole I may be wrong on some of these points I haven't actually seen the movie and i won't until it comes to DVD, but still the TV trailer and theater trailer looked to be horrible.way to ruin my favorite childhood show (sell-outs)EPIC FAIL!!!

ruffinelli_ro,It was fun.,4/10,2 June 2010,"Everybody seem to hate this title. Well, that's not my case. I am a huge fan of the original series, and I have seen almost everything that came from the universe of Dragon Ball. So when it was announced that there would be a movie I knew it would be a crappy one.With that in mind, I went to the theater with some friends with zero expectations. The result wasn't incredible, but in the end I found this movie watchable. Of course as the big fan I am, I found it awful. They butchered almost every good thing from the anime. They didn't include Krilin, Picoro was ugly (He was ugly in the series as well, but in a different, positive way) and Goku went to school. It is so loosely based on the original series that they can be considered as two unrelated and independent (Except for names) pieces of work.It was so clichéd filled and the acting was terrible. The product is an extremely forgettable movie for casual goers and insult for fans. But I liked it despite its flaws. Perhaps it is because I never thought of this as a serious Dragon Ball project, therefore I exclude this title from Toriyama's work.Before my conclusion I must mention the mighty Kame Hame Ha. What happened to it? It was a pretty decent technique in the series and games. But here is just some laughable thing that only serves to put out some candles, or cure diseases.I am really picky when it comes to movies, but this one might be the exception. I don't recommend this to anyone though."
raiden-16663,It's not the anime..,10/10,31 October 2019,"..and that's a good thing. The anime took what was great from the manga and dragged it out to a filler-slow dump. This movie on the other hand breaths new life into the franchise by re-imagining the story and therefore bringing new fans that probably wouldn't have stumbled upon the manga otherwise.

NJRocker091188,It's just eh!!!,5/10,19 April 2009,"Good things this movie has: 1.) Great action.2.) Excellent Special effects.3.) Excellent matrix. 4.) Cool Hummor.5.) A Few Charioteers that you can relate to. Like our hero know as Goku. In the beginning he shows some interest in trying to fit in, as well as talk to girls. It shows a guy's lack of knowing the right things to say that brings him the friends, n the girl. There is also another charioteer whom seems to be in this for the money, so that makes him like a Hon solo person in a way. But, that is not enough to give this film anything past a 5.It has a lot of plot holes, it does not explain much about what the Dragonball's are, or even what the fighting styles are, or what they are called, n why. I understand that if you already know all about Dragonball, there is no need for explanation. But if you are just the average movie goer you need a little more then Goku n his grandfather. So therefore, I give this movie a 5. To me it was decent."
MovieRat-2,Missed the mark by...a lot,5/10,20 April 2009,"My expectations for this live-action retelling of the one of anime's/manga's most beloved stories were generally mixxed going into the theater.Bad: Son Goku played by an actor of non-Asian descent and without a martial arts background (as far as I could tell); reports that they wanted this film to be more ""realisitc"" as apposed to the mystical-fantasy realm of the original; and the massive amounts of bad reviews and predictions from critics didn't help either.Good: Produced by Stephen Chow (the writer/director/star of SHAOLIN SOCCER and KUNG FU HUSTLE, classics); directed by James Wong (who gave us the action packed JET LI'S THE ONE); and Chow Yun-Fat starring as Master Roshi (a bit young but hey, it's Chow Yun-Fat!).With these ""good"" points, I figured that even if this was a bad film (which most martial arts films are) it would still be enjoyable and relatively faithful to the spirit of the original. What I saw, however, was a film that tried to live up to the original but falling way short of the mark and flat on its face. Not that it wasn't enjoyable, it was...it was that it wasn't Dragonball.I biggest complaint leaving the theater was that the film felt way too short. I know the director wanted to keep the character's to a minimum to build on characterization, but even with the characters present the story felt rushed with little time to truly enjoy them. The action also felt rushed, especially the final battle between Goku and Piccolo, deminishing the one thing that everyone loves about Dragonball: epic martial art battles. The attempt to make the story more ""realistic"" was more detrimental than anything else in this film.5 out of 10 for even attempting to make a live action film out of a story that spans hundreds of anime episodes and manga volumes into the length of an hour and a half. Still an interesting ""retelling"" despite its downfalls. Enjoyable but don't expect anything great."
jremigio2001,Dragon Ball Evolution saw it on Starz,3/10,13 September 2020,Saw this streaming on Amazon Fire Stick. I can see why it wasn't good. It didn't live up to expectations and went into total different directions for Dragon Ball Z fans. Lots of hate and high expectations. Expecting a fight between Goku and Piccolo except he turns into a monster. Pretty short battle. Non memorable scenes in this movie.
robertm-89,How was this approved?,3/10,1 May 2009,This will be a very short comment. I don't like writing a lot.1. Goku here is cocky. In the anime he isn't.2. Goku's hair looks more like his son's.3. Goku doesn't go to high school..Gohan does.4. It looked horribly like power rangers.5. Special effects were ridiculous.6. The Plot was stupid.7. Piccolo was laughable.These are some of the reasons I didn't like the movie. I guess it might be somewhat enjoyable for people who either: A. Like Power Rangers B. Hate Dragonball C. Never have seen Dragonball
PenitentPasser,Only two reasons to watch it...,6/10,20 July 2019,"Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung. Smoking hot! Since my review has to be longer for it to submit, let me say again...watch it for Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung.

dangermous,poor quality cheesy rubbish!,1/10,30 August 2011,"i had to wash my eyes out after watching this, really awful. I admit to being a fan of the cartoon and I've seen every episode but I was looking forward to this film in full knowledge it would not be the same. I have to say as a stand alone film it looked like they were just going through the motions. The dialogue was childish and the story had been squished into such a short space. No time at all had been taken to write a proper story - they just bastardised the original, Goku was a white teenage boy for Christ sake!they should have written a new story that just paid homage to the original coming up with something interesting but instead they ruined an already well developed story. i think they just made some cheap rubbish to see if they could get all the dragon ball fans to rent it!

kenpei,"ehh, hard to say, honestly",1/10,4 April 2009,"from the start of the movie, you can tell were most of the money went. I don't want to say this is an abomination, because there are worse, but, even as a movie I can't say its in any way good. The dialog is a little corny, the names are bad, and things feel a bit rushed and crammed. And if you do know the DB series, your gonna hate it. Honestly, if your going tot he movies, I'd say go see Fast and Furious. But then again, I guess its a matter of taste. The only thing I wish about this movie, is, it was the kind of bad that made it fun to watch, but sadly, the production tried to hard to make it a good movie with all the special effects and stuff they could afford. I think if your gonna cash in on Japanese pop-culture, leave it to the Japanese to do it. But then again, there are some anime/mangas that just cannot be live action. Anyone remember Fist of the North Star? Its a lose-lose situation for live action anime movies not made in japan. Don't believe me, check out Deathnote live action or prince of tennis and compare to the original source material, and then watch DBE and FotNS and compare. But to FotNS credit, it was true to the source, at least somewhat"
AngelFall1n,Dragon Ball Evolution,8/10,31 May 2021,"It's a feel-good movie, maybe not spot on like the original Dragon Ball Z that I grew up with, but it's worth the watch. Goku is portrayed as he should; clever, witty, humble, and humorous. The fight scenes are more realistic to the eyes, rather than being fully edited with CGI and special effects. The storyline and character development is well-paced. The only thing that was unsettling is the fact that Bulma looked exactly like Arianna Grande. Overall, Dragon Ball Evolution is humorous, diverse, and an enjoyable film in our modern times.

Nightopian-Raposa,Possibly the worst movie in my collection so far,1/10,2 March 2020,"I just finished my review of The Invisible, so i thought, yeah, i should review this too.Why is it so hard to adapt something to a movie? There ARE exceptions, a recent case being Sonic the Hedgehog, but others like the '93 Mario film or The Hunger Games just end up being thrashed for often good reasons. Dragonball Evolution is not only the worst movie adaptation ever conceived, but one of the worst movies of ALL TIME. In the history of cinema. Granted, i never watched the anime, but do i really need to see the source material to tell you how bad it is? What makes this horrendous is Justin Chatwin. He can't act in this. It really makes Robbie's mysterious reveal at the end of War of the Worlds seem more logical than HOW IN THE H CAN YOU NOT SAY A LINE LIKE YOU MEAN IT? AND you dragged Emmy Rossum, an actress from decent films like The Day After Tomorrow, into this? How can anybody sign on to a movie like this!? There are times DBE tries way too hard and times where it doesn't try at all.

thang-arsenal,This Movie Sucks!!,1/10,27 April 2009,"This movie sucks ! I bet that there is absolutely no slightly good comment about this movie has been made so far. It's wrong from the very basic - the story - all out of line. Nothing alike to the anime. The only common is the names. that's it. Nothing more... or.. or they are both sth you can watch on your little screen. I have never heard of a Goku going to high school, asking for the way flirting girls, and as far as I know, master Roshi is not that young :)). How disappointed it was for me (I guess it was as well for DBZ fan) when I see how they made our hero up like that... the more powerful Goku look, the more this Goku disappointed us. They have such an awful crew. I think they had never had a chance looking or watching at least an episode of this Dragonball series. EVER! ... They don't know how our characters should look like, don't know how the charateristics of each characters. The Kung-fu is.... way off .... nothing even close to ""real"" Goku... Visual Effect is like a play with painting background...This is .... :("
skullballmovies,They call this Dragonball?,2/10,14 July 2009,"What the hell? What in the holy sanity of the world (even though barely is left) happened here? What the crap? This is beyond repairable. I can't even live this down. The one thing they got right...the names. That's IT! Not even the origin of the Dragonballs was correct. Kami made them, not 7 gods or whatever they heck they wanted to try to pull off. Any huge fan of DBZ will never forgive the people that allowed this movie to happen. If they took everything that was DBZ related and chucked it out (which would have been easy) then it'd be a pretty good movie in itself. Not great, not horrible, just OK. But this...Oh my ******* god. Master Roshi wasn't the right age, Grandpa Gohan shouldn't have been alive to begin with, Bulma has guns? and is hot? Yamcha has weird hair, Goku doesn't have the right hair, not enough blasts, not cool enough fighting, shitty storyline, and what's with the PG rating? Ooh yea, kids totally could handle the show. It was pretty damn violent and it had quite a bit of blood in it. The show was AWESOME. I grew up with it (yes I know, I'm a hypocrite) but I watched every episode, owned TONS of action figures, I mean I was obsessed. I always dreamed one day of having a DBZ movie on the big screen. I was so excited when I heard about this...but I just had my dream destroyed, obliterated, because of this crap. I guess I'll just have to buy all the seasons of DBZ...relive the good days. You guys who made this movie, suck. Hard. Thanks a lot. Bastards."
warriorbornxl,A miss representation of the franchise for kids.,1/10,28 April 2009,"I saw this movie on a bootleg. Best decision, I ever made. I can sum up the movie in 3 words; tacky, corny, and confusing, all in the extreme. The story was sloppy, the characterization absolutely ridiculous. The only thing I liked about the movie was when it ended. I hear 11 year old kids love this movie, and that just appalls me. I do NOT want the next generation watching this movie and thinking that this is what dragon ball is about! What we need now, is a Reboot, like with the Hulk, with a different director, and better writers. I think the cast could have done a good job, it was just the story, script and directing(Not to mention special effects!)That really screwed the movie over. If you want to be original, learn from movies like transformers and especially Casino Royale. Casino Royale, because it is an original story that that is executed in a way that stays faithful to the novel, keeping the characters largely the same, and keeping the basic and important concepts of the novel.

punchdummy,Thanks for ruining a potential blockbuster,1/10,2 August 2009,First off the cast of characters sucked. I like Chow Yun Fat but he is not a martial artist and who thought that having Justin Chatwin play Goku would ever be a good idea. The only good match as far as characters go was Joon Park as Yamcha. And where was Krillin. I understand that the movie is not going to be exactly like the manga or anime but this movie was a joke. The movie itself is a window to the harsh reality that American cinema cannot do Japanese culture any justice. Perhaps this potential blockbuster franchise can be made over in the near future and we can forget this mess. The potential possibilities of a movie featuring upcoming characters such as Vegeta are huge. Please don't disappoint.
ScottJarreau,Another Case of unnecessary re-write,1/10,2 June 2014,"While the film was fun to watch and a great piece of visual that would keep the kids occupied for an hour on a Saturday morning, it was horrible. And not just as an adaptation of a classic story, but as a stand alone film; just bad. I understand that making a film adaptation of a television show, or comic series is difficult because there's usually tons of information that's been introduced throughout numerous episodes and issues. Somehow, the screen-writer has to summarize all of it to fit in to a 1 - 3 hour film. It's not easy. But what I don't get, is why virtually every adaptation of a show, or graphic novel or video game (This film of course being no exception) unnecessarily changes key elements of the original story. It's usually elements such as a character's origins or abilities; things that gave the character charisma to begin with. As a fan of the original anime, i was of course furious at how many idiotic changes were made to the storyline, props and character backgrounds. However, I was able to put aside my loyalty to the show and observe the film as a spectator and critique. And still didn't find very much that was redeeming about it. As a stand alone film, it needed much tweaking to be considered a good movie. And while I'd like to say that a good film doesn't need to follow another storyline regardless of it's basis and can shine on it's own... In the case of Dragonball, it's unfortunately not at all true. I mean, let's face it: Dragonball the series told a good story!! and deviating from that, destroyed the film. So once again like so many other remake films (Such as Last Airbender, Spider-Man, The Hulk, X-Men, etc.) this film tanked because the screen writers tried to ""outcreate"" the original classics. Learn your lesson people!! Don't try to improve upon classics!!"
caidenw-37050,An Insult to Itself and the Show and Manga,2/10,10 December 2016,"Ow* Ow* Ow* Sorry, I was hitting my head on my desk. This movie is terrible! It's not just nothing like the show nor manga, not to mention getting all the characters completely wrong; it has insultingly bad CGI. I know I keep using this word, but it really is insultingly bad!I know I might get some hate for this, but for some reason, some of the characters in this movie are Asian. In the manga and anime, there actually isn't a confirmed continent known as Asia on their version of Earth. Therefore, none of the characters are actually Asian. There's not much difference in skin tone excluding the white ethnicity and black ethnicity, and no, that's not racist. It wouldn't have hurt to make their skin color not look so close to the actual color black, but it's not racist. Mr. Popo isn't even human!Now, back on topic, the acting is...pretty bad. There's awkward pauses at a lot of points, and Goku, for some reason, seems like a Hollywood heartthrob not to mention being in high school for some reason despite never going to grade school in the anime nor manga.Some of the characters are white while some of them are Asian...which again makes so little since. Even worse, ki blasts and energy attacks look a lot more like air bending from The Last Air Bender movie. The CGI is the equivalent of that turd everyone leaves in the toilet each morning.Akira Toriyama reportedly tried to put a lot more of his input into the movie, but he was shut out by the studio producers and/or executives.Master Roshi...I'm sorry. ""Master Roshi"" looks much younger in this movie.There's nothing redeeming about this movie!"
coogeeknights,Kamahama... Dyied,1/10,10 April 2009,"When i first heard about the idea of a dragonball movie i thought it would be a flop to be honest, because you just can't capture what the cartoon could! although as time went on i could see a vision of a great movie if it was on a high budget but i was to learn that it was the opposite.From within the first 5 minutes of the movie i could tell where it was headed and seemed continue going downhill throughout the movie. the first scene is a fighting scene between him and his grandfather gohan. from watching the action displayed in this scene you would understand why it hurts to watch being a dragonball fan (of the cartoon). all of the cartoon series' were high impact, full on, fast paced, heavy and a one of kind martial arts fighting style.. from this first scene.. it was disgraceful. was a terrible sort of elegant slow (when i say slow i mean sooo slow) martial arts fighting action. The matrix seemed fasted when they were in slow-mo. made me sad :(Goku in the movie was an okay performance.. could of been better but also could of been a lot worse. Goku's top characteristics are thirst for battle, his ever always hungry stomach, his childlike personality, his hair and his strength. in the movie they touched on his hair and his strength. Goku was the typical teenager in the movie and this didn't work for me as Goku is always the childlike grown up and in the movie he gets bullied!! I don't think goku should of gone to school in the movie and if he did the school like vision should of been a lot different.Bulma's character had all the right personality traits but bulma with guns??? huh? shouldn't she be smart one as well? she seemed like a twit to me. The only thing i noticed about ChiChi was what was on her chest to be honest!I thought that Yamcha's character personality was probbaly the thickest when it comes to the cartoon but he wasn't even a fighter?! huh?Piccolo's character had potential.. but wrong makeup department! he looked like a tool to be honest. as soon as his face came onto the scene the cinema erupted in laughter.. the funniest bit of the movie was his face. Piccolo's character was never really developed.. he didn't do anything wrong.. well really anything that wrong. Maybe he should of killed more innocent people? He just wasn't seen as a threat or a big bad guy.in a nutshell, poor action, cheesy jokes weren't funny or slightly enjoyable, the romantic teenage love wasn't necessary, Yamcha wasn't ever a fighter! actors didn't seem to understand there roles very well, poor selection of characters, poor storyline and writers.. sorry out there all you fans but that's the absolutely nicest way i could put it.. they left it off for there to be a sequel.. so i don't believe it should continue but perhaps have another shot at doing it from a different director and crew.. perhaps bring in the old writers of the cartoon. try and bring in all those who worked on the cartoon and make a really good film because there is great potential. perhaps tackle on the Z side of dragonball. Vegeta/Raditz Vs Goku main story lines?"
markblumenthal,doesn't deserve a grade.,1/10,19 July 2017,"Nothing in this film makes sense and I cant believe that the people involved had the audacity to release it and charge people for it. The fact that this film exists proves that not anyone can make a movie. I am biased with this film as I am a true DragonBall Z fan. But I feel that majority of the people who paid to watch this film are fans of the anime. Everything about this film is garbage. From the acting to the story to the dialogue. If you want to know what NOT to do when making a film, just watch this. The people who worked on this film clearly had no respect for the fans or the amazing story on which it's based. If you are going to watch it, then please prepare yourself for what I feel is the worst movie ever made. Doesn't deserve a grade of 1.

cool-au,Just WOW,1/10,3 May 2009,"One word ""Sad"" Don't waste your time watching this movie. Chow Yun-Fat was master Master Roshi?. He just ruins his reputation just by being in this movie. He should just stick with being cool and killing people with his guns. The special effect was decent but still a lot of flaw, especially when Bulma drives her vehicle. I'm not being raciest, but Goku should be Asian since in the TV show Guku appears to be Asian. At the end, when Goku changed his cloths into a want a be Asian, what when I turn off the movie. The story line is mess up. I'm still trying to associate the movie and the TV show as we speak. Anyone plan to watch this stupid movie, it better to put in south park instead. Cheer."
matsuringo24,Train Wreck,1/10,10 April 2009,"Let's get this clear, Hollywood butchers stories from books, games and anime like clockwork, but this is something else entirely. I was afraid this movie would not only ruin the Dragon Ball name, but it would misinform people who do not like Dragon Ball. There is a slight relief in the fact that whether or not you are a Dragon Ball fan, you will find that this movie is -terrible-.As the summary states, this is a train wreck; you don't want to watch it, but you can't look away. I expected the Dragon Ball aspects to be changed to the director's whims (which they were from story elements, to character uniforms), however they went one step beyond. This movie was completely converted into something far worse than even the worst 80's low budget kung fu flick.When you remove all the Dragon Ball fan service as WELL as any shred of a credible story, the question posed to the studio is: Who do you think is going to enjoy this?"
quoozlefreak,Absolutely terrible...,7/10,18 April 2009,"So why did I give it a seven? Because it was terrible in a GOOD way, but I really wasn't willing to make the vote any higher either.I went into the movie theater expected an absolutely horrible movie that would make my eyes BLEED. And I got that. I love DragonBall and DBZ, even though the shows really made no sense... I was willing to laugh at that. I was not insulted at all by this movie and I actually enjoyed it, not in a serious way of course. Of course, it's nothing at all like DragonBall... Maybe very loosely but nothing like it at all.I knew it was going to be terrible, and terrible it was. The acting, especially by Yamcha's actor, was horrible. The only exception was for Piccolo's actor - he actually did a pretty good job. Also, the women, all of them, all have very nice views of their boobs, especially ChiChi. I labeled her mostly as Talking Boobs. The whole movie was ridiculous and made no sense at all, and that's saying a lot given how little sense the show made.If you're the type of DragonBall fan who's willing to laugh at your fandom or you hate DragonBall, it's the perfect movie.But take note, if you are DragonBall fan... Do have some DVDs of the actual show waiting for you. You'll need it for healing. I may have enjoyed it, but I still needed to redeem the show in my eyes."
supersaiyian,Dragon Ball Good and Bad all at the same time,1/10,10 April 2009,"I have been waiting for years for this to come out I was so excited when I first heard the first news on dbz.com then I had the misfortune to watch the trailer a few months ago. I just couldn't help it after years and years of watching it on cartoon network and I almost have every DVD anime movie I just have to go see it on opening day. Here is what I found and I am taking this in two directions one from a fan for years and another from some one just going to the movies to see a movie.Fan: They dropped the ball big time. It quickly turned into just another Hollywood story. They didn't keep the story line at all really the bare base line is there I guess but they changed so much that it was really almost nothing left but the names from the show and they even messed some of those up. I may be wrong and I hope I am but I think they called shenron shenlong, and mispronounced namek as nemic I think is what Goku said near the first of the movie. If you are the fan of this show and really want to see a movie devoted to it I am sorry you waited in vain Hollywood has stuck again and butchered this one pretty bad. I understand why they changed some minor things to widen the audience but somethings they changed, and I am making a list up to 20 so far, I just don't see any reason for it.Common Movie Goer: From a general perceptive this really wasn't a bad movie it had a basic story line anyone could catch on too. It had romance, action and big special effects. The basic battle of good verse evil and a good list of good actors like Yun-Fat Chow. If you are looking for a good action movie that will have you ooooooing and ahhhhhing this might be for you.In summary If you are a fan you will want to cry like I did at the end of this movie. If you are a person that doesn't even know what in the world a dragon ball is but like action you might like this movie. ON a 1 out of 10 for a fan this is a 0 nothing for you at all. Just a normal movie goer it is more like a 5 maybe 6."
supernick-3,A true Hollywood adaptation,5/10,2 June 2009,"It's truly amazing to see everybody obliterating this movie. Some first-timers just registered on IMDb to be able to express their disgust about this film adaptation. Of course, most people who react are die-hard fans of the original manga.Look, when I was a kid, I used to read all those Marvel comics, presuming they would be available in my little village in Belgium. On TV I was addicted to all those manga series on the French channels. I am also a die-hard fan! My closet is filled with both comics and manga series.Here's the thing. Let's take the X-Men, Spiderman, Batman, and God knows what other recent film adaptation, and they're in several cases nowhere near the written holder of the name. Let's get to the manga field, and take Fist of the North Star, with several 'big' names. What was up with the guy playing Kenshiro here? Dragonball Evolution is doing basically the same as movies mentioned above: it takes some elements from the original story, usually elements that cover several years of that story. It tries to make a whole. It fails, as expected (the final fighting scene is indeed terrible), but delivers in some way (the main character had potential).What would be good? Some kid with a tail running around naked, turning into King Kong, fighting childish monsters from the Red Ribbon army? No, you need adolescents, but then you must change the story. The whole idea of the dragon balls has to be introduced, so they integrated it in the change. They try to use the relevant characters from the original: a tech girl, a skilled thief, an old pervert martial arts expert, a dead grandfather, a chick that will hold the love interest of the protagonist, and of course a monster to fight with.No, it's not the same as the manga. No, the actors probably didn't all check out what it's all about, which makes them seem sometimes bad. No, the hardcore fans will never be satisfied. But yes, it's entertaining for a clueless crowd, and it can be entertaining for people who keep an open mind. The movie industry is all about commercialization, not so much about tradition. I would take my kids to see this. I'm happy I saw it. I can see myself watching it again.I'm sorry if many will not agree with this point of view. I didn't expect much, and I got more than I expected. That's a passing grade in my book."
TheZoolooMaster,Journey to the East,6/10,13 April 2009,"This is perhaps not so much a review of the film per se, as it is a reflection on the Dragon Ball Evolution phenomenon. For obvious reasons I have abbreviated the title of the Manga and the film in this review: from now on, Dragon Ball Evolution will be referred to as DBE. For those DB fans who know their stuff, who understand the origins of the DB adventure tale, who understand where Toriyama delved for inspiration in inventing the character of Son Goku, appreciating the filmed adaptation of what could now be called a mythic franchise might be a smaller ask than for most. You see, DBE is alien to DBZ; it differs in more than its form of media. What the creators of this odd Hollywood production have done -- and this is perhaps worthy of some praise -- is searched at the core and heart of what DB is about. They understood, at least in part, the importance of the themes of initiation and innocence which pervade the early tomes of the DB saga. DBE tries to reflect this atmosphere and open the DB universe to the ignorant public. It is often interesting to thoroughly study the popular reception of an adaptation of this kind, especially when the subject matter for the film is not already in a linear form. When novels or plays are transposed onto the big screen, the eagerly anticipating fan can expect something specific – he already has an outline of the movie in his mind. I suppose that, in such a situation, the fan's expectations are justified, and his opinion of the final product is based on more than thin air. But as far as DB is concerned, thisexcuse is no more. No doubt each fan had his own personal idea and opinion of what the DB film should be. Some people would have envisaged an intricate original plot, others would have imagined their favourite characters acting out in their best light, a few would have hoped for a transposition of cult scenes from the Anime or Manga. Each individual would have, safely and comfortably, established in their own mind a perfect idea of what the ideal adaptation would be, catered to himself. Obviously, no two people can share the exact same ideas. Moreover, no one really has the right to expect anything from such an adaptation; unless someone were to have invented and planned on paper an adaptation of his own, and that his version of DB were to have been met more warmly by an objective public – indeed, unless that person were to have been proved more clever than the whole production crew –, he really has no right to say: --They made a mess of it!One could even call it foolish to criticise a film for not following a very personal and intimate ideal or fantasy. To exacerbate this problem, more often than not, most of the childish complaints directed towards the film issue from minds unprepared to present their own examples of the perfect adaptation.It would be too easy to string out a web of accusations without putting these very views into question. No doubt DBE has its faults, but the mistake would be to selfishly assume that they consist mainly of details that are not in accordance with one's personal ideal.The Hollywood machine turned DBE into a strange specimen of marketing combined with the influence of the popular DB franchise. What resulted is a kind of crossbred mutant, half Japanese, half American. The directors saw the need to bring it back to home, thus drastically changing the DB universe; Son Goku suddenly resembles a close to ordinary American college student who goes to school every day. In addition, a large portion of the cast is American, including Bulma, although she seems to be hiding behind a strange culture camouflage. It's hard to say what she's supposed to be. In fact, this lack of consistency and logic plagues most areas of the movie. While it primarily concentrates on martial arts and various Asian traits and traditions, the environment and attitudes of most of the characters are strikingly Western. Why is Son Goku Caucasian? Why is Bulma dressed up like a cos-play aficionado? Why is Roshi younger than Son Gohan? Why does he live in the middle of the city for that matter? Many of these questions are hard to justify, but one underlying aspect of DB seems to be neglected whenever such accusations against the film crop up. If one looks back, closely, at the original Manga, the lack of sense and grounding in reality is far more evident. Some characters are Asian, others Caucasian; some are not even human; giants and dinosaurs roam the land; everyone speaks the same language; Goku is 14 yet looks like a baby, etc. Nonetheless, because it is a cartoon, such details areforgiven. It seems like the directors were slightly carried away when transferring such diverse elements onto the big screen. Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten that motion pictures demand an extra layer of subtlety.DBE had to face seemingly insurmountable obstacles, perhaps the same ones that warranted why few people three years ago could have hoped, in their wildest dreams, that a live action feature film could be made. DB is a story that was written and designed to be told through drawings. The film medium simply is not suited for it. The wholesoul, the very identity of DB would have had to be discarded. Well, it seems the producers went half-way in that respect; but the soul is still there. Because, in fact, DBE is an adventure and it carries much of the magic and mystery of the original tale with it."
defilethearcane,"bad, bad, bad!!!!!!!!!!!!",1/10,10 April 2009,"This is just an all out disgrace. I can't believe they did this to something that I loved to watch as a kid. Listen, this movie is so bad I'd rather watch the Ben 10 made-for-t.v. movie with my son 10 times straight before I watch this movie again, and that's saying something. Not only is it a disgrace to Akira Toriyama and his wonderful Dragonball universe, it's a really bad movie. Everything about it was off. It shouldn't even have been called Dragonball. These dragonballs sure do stink real bad, and collecting em all couldn't create a wish big or good enough to fix this.... Unless they remade this movie with A LOT MORE MONEY, at least 3-4 hours long, good director, better casting, rated-R or at least pg-13 rating, better fighting, better storyline, better dialog.... Effin' everything that would make a movie stand out, there's no way Hollywood should ever touch this or any other classic anime'. If Gatchaman, or Ninja Scroll are anything like this movie when they come out, I will definitely blow.

jazzyboo87,I actually HOPE there is a sequel!,10/10,14 April 2009,"I don't know what the big deal is. I saw the movie and I didn't think it was bad at all. And you know what? I HOPE there will be a sequel. Because I LOVE Vegeta! And I think that it actually had the potential to be a good movie if people weren't ragging on it before they even saw it! I mean look at the Death Note and Sailor Moon live actions. They were WAAAAAAAY worse than this movie! So I think it deserves a LOT more credit than it's being gived. LOL Obviously it doesn't follow the story line very well but for what it does bring cheesy humor that I think all Dragonball fans can appreciate. Call me crazy or stupid all you want. But as a die-hard DB and DBZ fan I went, I saw and I am buying the DVD. ^O^

SilverKiento,An Entertaining Abomination,5/10,5 April 2009,"The summary says it all, this film is an entertaining abomination. Let's start with the bad... Most of the acting is awful, the writing is even worse, and the story is the original story only it's been ripped to shreds, which makes it become incoherent, especially near the end. A lot of things just don't make sense and there is no explanation for them. And this here is the major fail point of the movie... there are NOT ENOUGH FIGHT SCENES. There are like 2 or 3 fight scenes in the entire movie, and the best one is the very first one, if you've seen any Dragonball series you know that the main focus is the fighting, so why make a movie that lacks the main element of the original series? Even so.. I found the movie to be entertaining. Though the lack of fight scenes is heavily disappointing, the writers/director did manage to capture a little bit of that anime-type comedy charm. At some points you feel like you're watching a badly made anime.. but in live action.. which is pretty much exactly what you're watching, and that's funny for some reason.The special effects in this movie are actually fairly decent, though the ki blasts seem too.. ""gentle"".. almost like smoke, when in the anime and the games they are definite balls of energy, not just wisps. The kamehameha at the end IS kind of disappointing, but it could have been worse.My advice to anyone that wants to see this movie... if you are a die hard Dragonball fan.. don't see it. Or if you do go to see it, don't go with the expectation of seeing your beloved Dragonball remade into an action packed live action film of awesome or you WILL be disappointed and you'll probably want to burn the theater down. I watched this movie with extremely low expectations and I got some pleasant surprises here and there, but the movie was still bad. Even so, I'd watch it again.. even if only to make fun of it with friends. It really could have been worse."
basoekha,Even the Middle East is angry about this movie!,1/10,11 April 2009,"I knew it! I knew it! The first time I heard that Hollywood was going to make a live-action version of one the most popular Japanese action animation series I was very sceptic. Because I know how most of the big film companies work. They want to make something that appeals to a large audience so they can cash in on the profits. In doing that they always destroy the purity of the original story. I know that sacrifices have to be made. Not everything from the DBZ world can be put in a live action movie, but common. Why did have to make such a dumb movie with so much clichés? Goku a high school teenager with teenage problems. He get's trained by his grandfather in martial arts? Uuuhm...Karate Kid anyone??This movie sucks so much that I can write pages full of bad comments about it. Instead of that I'll urge everyone to watch the following youtubeclip, which expresses precisely what my feeling are about this movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVnIRfYJWX0Watch it and spread this clip if your are also disappointed in this movie adaption."

Fillask,Guess what?,1/10,11 April 2009,"It indeed sucks ^^ I went to the cinema 2 days ago knowing it would be like this but ah hell, I saw every single episode of the DragonBall series in English and Japanese and I just had to see this.Even though it was horrible, it was funny ^^ Especially since I went with my friend and we're both great fans of the DragonBall Z Abridged series made by TeamFourStar (Youtube it, it's awesome :P) And we could made some comments on the movie to pass the time.And once again I am happy I'm a guy, 'cause the only real things that caught my attention were Bulma and that Piccolo henchman chick. ^^ Well, all in all, it's funny, but you should only go to the cinema knowing you're gonna pay 9 euros for a waste of time. But with that thought it can be fun :) Btw, that Goku guy makes a lot of the same expressions as the Chosen One from Kung Pow.. Kung Pow's acting and humor is way better tho :P"
stinger01,a good film with loads of potential,6/10,18 April 2009,i really liked this film like most others who have reviewed this film i went in there with no expectations especially after hearing so many bad reviews about it but i decided to give it a go and you no what i really liked it I thought all the characters where cast perfect ally and yes that includes goku i thought the effects were top notch and they really helped me think that i was in that universe the story was grate it felt like a dragon ball story to be proud off. There was one thing that really annoyed me about the movie and that was Yamaha's server accent i mean what the hell was up with that i thought that roshi had all the best lines but i loved goku's end speech before he fights piccolo that was just grate
smashayre,Not as bad as some would have you believe.,9/10,12 April 2009,"I must admit that these boards leading up to the release of this film seem to be very much biased against this project. And jaded at best about the original attempt an a live action rendition of Dragon Ball entitled Dragonball: The Magic Begins. If you're looking for it then you might want to try Youtube or some other online video site. I think everyone should watch that movie first if not at least as much of it as you can stand before you see this one.So where do I stand then? Is this an abomination on celluloid like the rater(s) before me would have you believe? Not necessarily. But I will say this its not the same exact dragon ball as the animation. I think if you go into this with the mindset that its more like one of those standalone spin off movies like they did with the animated series? It would work a lot better than viewed as a straight up adaptation.For those who say its nothing even remotely like the original dragonball animation let's do a point by point comparison to Dragonball and not just Draginball Z( but we'll get to that later).In the first season of the animation entitled The Emperor Pilaf Saga?1. Bulma has completely blue hair. (In the movie its just a single streak of blue and she looks more like an extra from Tank Girl the movie. There's no denying that Tank Girl was a bad movie but it has a cult following nonetheless as does the comic...)2. Bulma has a tracking device she used to track down the locations of Dragon Balls. (In the movie? She has one too)3. Bulma has these capsules that she uses to make different things. One of which is a motorcycle. (In the movie she has one too)4. Bulma and Goku rode the motorcycle to make most of their way to the dragonballs. (In the movie they do too although there was a slight change where they have him running behind it while she rides with Master Roshi. In the animation Master Roshi didn't ride with them in the first season if I recall correctly. In fact I don't recall him ever leaving his place of residence much at all.)5. Goku became Oozaru (that giant monkey monster with a tail)near the end of the saga. (In the movie there's no tail on him when he becomes Oozaru but he does still become him near the end of the movie.)6. Goku first met Bulma when she confronts him over his dragonball which he said he received from his grandfather.(The movie took some creative liberties with this. Instead just having them talk they fought a little bit while they talked.)7. Goku learned the Kamehameha attack from Master Roshi. (He learns it from him in the movie as well but once again they took some creative liberties by turning it into a romantic prelude to his time spent with Chichi.)8.When Goku first meets Chichi she's wearing a helmet of some sort and they fight. (In the movie she never wears a helmet but they do fight but not during their first meeting. In fact he doesn't even learn that she's a fighter till a little later into the film.)9. Its reveal that Master Roshi's a pervert (yes even more so than the pervey sage from Naruto) because one of his skin mags is found. (In the movie one of his skin mags is found by Bulma but for some reason it just doesn't feel the same.)For these 9 reasons? I'm giving it a 9. Its not perfect but its not that bad either. Oh an Yamcha is met by them as well as the Great Dragon being summoned to grant a wish and the Dragonballs being scattered after said wish is made.The thing they've changed the most is they took out a lot of the bodily function humor. There is no farting Emperor Pilaf. Bulma doesn't accidentally pee off Goku's magical extending staff. Oh yes there is no magical extending staff.I'm not sure if James Wong and company were aware of the source of inspiration for DragonBall? But I'm almost certain that ""The Journey to the West"" was the source to some extent. In particular the Monkey King who has Goku as one of his many names and a magical extending staff were most likely the basis for Goku.Also there are no dinosaurs in the movie so don't bother looking for them."
sidekicknick43,"Mor like ""Dragons**t Evolution""",4/10,13 April 2009,"I'm gonna get straight to the point. This movie is stupid, poorly made, and... okay. It sucks.First, the acting is terrible. A line in the film is ""I will avenge him"" and it's painfully hollow. I was expecting them to reveal that everybody was robots at the end. The only good actors in the movie are Yun-Chow-Fat, or however you say his name, and James Marsters. By the way, James Marsters- Piccolo- the villain- with the best dialog in the movie- is barely in the film. I mean it. On that subject, there are so many underdeveloped plots in the film. Especially the love subplots. Apparently, all i need to do to get a girl is open her locker for her. And what was up with Yamcha and Bulma? They immediately hit on each other, even after Yamcha traps them in a hole/cave. Next, the effects. Awful. The Oozaru. I'm shocked that that thing got past the editing room. That and those monsters that piccolo sends after the heroes. Oh, I almost forgot to question why, when these people meet each other- they automatically say ""Oh. I've got to help you."" What the heck is that? On the good side, I enjoyed the last twenty minutes of the movie despite the effects. Like I said, James Marsters and Chow-Yun-Fat are good and Roshi was funny. But, there is just nothing to offer here. The movie's biggest problem is that it's stupid and the jerks at Fox clearly didn't care at all about Dragonball.4/10REBOOT PLEASE"
dnnsmoyo,"No, just no",1/10,7 September 2018,"Delete this. This is not DBZ. This movie is not even close to anything related to DBZ. The only similarities are the names, nothing else. This movie had potential to be a different sci-fi movie though not DragonBall. Movie is bad.

SAOking,Hollywood did it again!,1/10,22 May 2019,"I really advise the dragonball fans and even the ones who aren't to NOT SEE this sort of movie.I mean a sort of movie because this i cant rate this as a movie in respect to the movie industry.We all have reasons to be scared each time a live action movie sets to be released, and this one is the perfect example of why.I dont even have words to describe what went wrong because...well, it all went wrong.Storyline is a joke compared to our beloved anime series, the cast did an awfull job, it like they didnt want to be there, and i can understand why, the CGI was laughable to say the least.Even the DB Evolution writer came to apologize to the DB fans (it doesnt give me back the wasted time but at least he recognized the crap that was done in the first place)I can only see this movie as a barrier to not cross for future references."

logeesp,Guilty Pleasure,6/10,21 May 2019,"Dragonball Evolution was a movie I hated when I went to go see it in theaters, but I was 8 years old when I watched it. I just recently saw the movie and my opinions about the movie somewhat changed. The fight scenes are silly some of the time, yet entertaining. The acting is tolerable and the special effects are okay. James Wan gave us a HORRIBLE adaptation to the manga, if not the anime. I felt that if someone who actually watched the damn anime or bothered to do the movie justice at all would direct this movie a whole lot better. However, this movie holds a place in my heart like The Last Airbender did, and I'll always enjoy it.

MovieVanguard,Airbender or Evolution( Which adaptaion did it worse),1/10,22 July 2022,"I have not been a dragon ball fan for very long, during the covid19 lockdown I had a lot of downtime so I watched the entire dragon ball lineup of anime, and Eversince I would call myself a casual fan of the franchise. When I learned that this film inspired the resurrection of the dragon ball franchise, mainly because of how the creator( Akira Toriyama) of the manga was so mad at this film and what it did to his creation he brought back the series by spearheading the production of Dragon Ball Battle Of gods which at the time of release had been the first film released in 17 years. I also heard about this film from a few movie reviewers like Chris Stuckmmen. I knew that I had to watch the film because of its reputation and my newfound interest in the dragon ball franchise.After finding it on Disney plus I decided to give it a watch to see for myself just how bad it was..... that was a mistake. This film pays zero respect to the material and is a complete utter mess from characters to the story, action effects, acting, and having zero to do with the anime/manga it is trying to adapt.It reminds me som much of M. Night Shyamalan's Last air bender movie and how it went out of its way to shame the source material and throw out everything that made their original properties so beloved.There is little more I can say that hasn't already been said. But I am grateful somewhat because this film lead to the creation of Battle of Gods my first exposure to the dragon ball property and led to the creation of my favorite character of the franchise Beerus. So at least there's my justification for the one star."
qasnazrul1234,"Better than ""Citizen Kane""",1/10,1 August 2009,"I was really enjoying the comments and was laughing my heart out at some point in time. I thought of leaving this website fully satisfied. But during the end I saw some comments and they made me to write this. When I first heard about the movie, I decided not to watch it because I thought DB is way beyond any live-action adaptation (all the fans know why). When I saw the trailer I was however surprised by the movie makers' creativity when I saw a Master Roshi with silky hair fit for any convincing shampoo ad. I knew instantly that the movie team is gonna surpass 'Citizen Kane', 'Shawshank Redemption', etc. easily. I knew that the movie would be too intellectual and too realistic for a stupid idiotic DB fan fool like me. Some coveted jury members of Academy Awards even said that they wanted a realistic movie so that they could relate themselves with Goku (just like Batman i guess). I am a hardcore DB fan and I too, like any other DB fan, would like to meet these 'beings' from Planet Vegeta (although I like DB but I am sane enough to accept the fact that Goku is an alien unlike the ones who want to relate themselves with Goku). Apart from these, 'Citizen Kane', hah, way too inferior than this masterpiece of this century. Right now I am waiting for at least 10 sequels so that I can send them to Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. They can make millions of copies, give them different names and drop them from air in countries like US and UK. People would watch them without suspicion and would definitely kill each other or commit suicide after watching such noble creations for they would think how worms like them dared to adore modern day ""MONALISA"" called sequels of DRAGONBALL EVOLUTION. Finally, terrorist organizations can enjoy a result far more devastating than 9/11."
leagz,It's funny but I actually enjoyed this movie!,10/10,14 April 2009,"Everybody is so negative about this movie so of course I had to be stubborn and go see it for myself.I think everybody was (and is) expecting a 'Dragonball Z' movie instead of just Dragonball (without the Z that is). If you want to see a whole lot of rapid fire balls, instant transmissions, gallic guns, Neo vs Agent Smith kind of fighting and Super Sayins ...maybe DBE 2 and this movie is not (not yet I hope) what you're waiting for.This movie is based on Dragonball. The early years. ...A whole other story line but it's still based on Dragonball. And it wasn't bad. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. I enjoyed it. (maybe because I had no expectations, but still.)If this movie wasn't called Dragonball and had nothing to do with Dragonball, this same movie would have been rated 6 instead of 3. I'm sure of that.And of course some scene's seemed a bit rushed, and Piccolo's outfit looks like Batman vs The Matrix, and Brian Singer/Michael Bay would have directed the **** out of this movie. ...Ah well! Maybe DBE 2.So if this movie was an attempt to be like Dragonball Z then yes it's rated 3. But assuming it's based on Dragonball, call me crazy I give it a 6 because I enjoyed it."
joeanythinggoes,This movie sucked Dragon Balls,2/10,12 July 2009,"Awful ,but i'm giving it a 2 because it was not as bad as street fighter the legend of chun li. There is no doubt about it, this movie sucked but it is so bad it's good. If you want to enjoy the movie do not think of it as a DBZ movie make believe this movie has nothing to do with Dragon B all Z and only then would you enjoy it.Watching this movie with high expectations is the worst thing to can do. The only thing this movie has in common with DBZ is the names they use in the movie so, don't expected anything you were use to seeing in the cartoon show. In conclusion, the movie was not that bad when you don't think of it as a DBZ movie but more of a normal action movie.

Bardok82000,Unexceptional waste of a movie,2/10,15 December 2020,"Like most, i was hyped when this was released, but my god what a load of rubbish this was. It gained notoriety in the last few years purely because of how awful it is, James Wong should be embarrassed, and as others have said, the story and character changes were unnecessary. I'll be fair and say Emmy Rossum was convincing as Bulma with American sass, along with Chow Yun-Fat who added a touch of that famously eccentric East-Asian humor, it's just a pity nothing worked too well outside of that. There was so much material to work with, and so many story arcs to choose from, and the best they could do was make Goku a highschool kid, and turn Piccolo into a generic villain of the week. I really hope if ever the remake comes into fruition, the movie does a better job and utilizes the source material a bit more

Diego_Crazy_Dark,It Wasn't That Bad,10/10,24 April 2009,"Let me start by saying am 14 years old and since i was like five i starting watching dragonball, i really liked the show and when they announced 20th century fox was making a movie i got really excited because i liked the cast, (No i wasn't mad because Goku wasn't Asian because Goku is an alien not a Japanese guy) the posters and the director but when the trailer was released i was laughing my ass off at how bad it was and i noticed krillin wasn't there(i liked the cast but the main characters were in it so i thought krillin was in the cast too) so i lost my interest in watching it but finally i bought it yesterday for like 2 bucks so i didn't have good expectations but really the movie wasn't that bad in fact it was OK i mean everybody tried their best the acting was good, the director did a good job i had that feel like i was watching dragonball, the effects were OK, sheng long and the dragon balls looked awesome and piccolo looked really good but the dialogue was horrible it felt like a was watching a street fighter movie and the major changes weren't good like krillin and the oozaru (that was the worst part of the movie the oozaru wasn't even big it was just like a really big chimp) but really this movie deserves more that it gets and also i gived this a 10 because i wanted the movie to have a higher score common this should have at least a 5 or a 6 not a 3.2 (so i would of give this a 6)"
aalroth,It's a disgrace,1/10,16 August 2019,"This is like the 1998 Godzilla movie. This is NOT dragon ball at all. They ruined all the characters. They made goku go to school to appeal to the younger audience. The cgi is awful. Just everything about this movie is a disgrace to dragon ball

wyattjordan-10527,Oozaru? More like snoozaru. I'm sleep.,1/10,12 March 2020,"I was really tired when I watched this movie, and lost the plot, but that doesn't matter because everyone on this website is leaving bad reviews anyway. I wish Texas Battle would have lived up to his roles in Sexy Urban Legends, and Richard Blake should have had more screen time. I would give it a zero, but I'm giving it a 1 because the dragon balls look cool.

fridlejf,Some Decent Points But Ultimately Falls Short,5/10,11 April 2009,"I've been a fan of both Dragonball and Dragonball Z for years. While it was not the first anime I ever saw it did get me interested in the genre. However, when I watched the film I tried to see it from a non-fan's eyes. Sadly to say even with my blinders on the movie did not live up to my expectations for an entertaining film.The Good: In consideration of special effects the film did a decent job. The fight sequences were smooth. The make-up effects decent. Some of the stylized issues done with the film were interesting as well. I understood trying to make the film appear modern and at times this idea worked.Some of the actors did a decent job as well. Chow Yun-Fat played a decent Master Roshi and Justin Chatwin managed to capture the innocence of Goku. James Marsters did a decent job of Piccolo even if his screen time was relatively short. And Emmy Rossum crafted an interesting, but believable Bulma.The Bad: If your fan of the anime you will be annoyed to say the least, so I will leave that discussion there. If you are looking for decent movie you may be upset. The film is campy and reminds me of the old Street Fighter, Double Dragon, and Super Mario movies, but without the charm. The plot is convoluted and uneven. I understand that the world of Dragonball is not our world. Yet, I still could not suspend disbelief. the multiple types of creatures and characters in the film, an aspect understood in the show, is never fully explained in my opinion. The acting for some the characters is over the top. Yamcha's appearance and acting in the movie is particularly random. I guess to sum up the main issue, the film does not know where it is going. It has an idea, and even some of the skills necessary but falls short before it can fully explore those ideas. I'm not surprised considering how epic the show was.Overall: I think children will enjoy this movie. I think the lowering of the rating to PG will garner it some decent amount of attention for kids. The film may one day be a cult hit but I doubt it. Overall, I again think the film reeks of those films we liked as kids and as adults for childhood nostalgia, but will fall short for anyone over 13 years of age. Hopefully, the sequel will take the grown up route that the Dragonball Z series took. In other words: more action, simpler story, and less thoughtful points."
donaramu,This movie should have never been made. The world would be a better place without it.,4/10,2 December 2021,"Everything about this is bad. I just finished watching it again because I was bored. It was so lame I couldn't focus on the movie. And as somebody who watched the show on and off for 20 years, I am not basing my views on the movie on how different it is from the show.This movie should have never been made. The world would be a better place without it.

OK..maybe the special effects but duh...common u guys..don't u ever watch dragon ball? i didn't expect the movie would be exactly the same as the anime but this is totally screwed..this is the list of the EVOLUTION's on the dragon ball the movie1.grandpa gohan supposed to die when goku turns into an ape and kill him -movie>grandpa gohan died because piccolo kill him and guess what,master roshi died coz ape goku kill him2.goku supoosed to ride on flying nimbus(yellow cloud)instead of a bike bought on e-bay3.this is the best part..goku turns into an ape when he sees the full moon but they make him turn into an ape when the eclipse.4.Goku didn't go to school..he is supposed to be very null.5.the girl with piccolo can shape shift??never knew that6.why did goku wear blue pants instead of macthing yellow costume?7.why did some black guy is bald and have a white beard instead of mater roshi?i can list a lot more of the things that are different but i should stop rite now..though,i do find some similarities of the voice of yamcha in the movie and in the anime remastered..i give u that..overall...not good..hey,why don't u give steven Spielberg make the 2nd sequel huh?maybe it'll work out"

espunier,"Flag waving ignorant geeks, waving their hate flags around",8/10,28 March 2009,"When the first notice was heard that a movie was going to be made based on the DragonBall franchise, everybody started saying things like their childhood was going to be destroyed, that there couldn't be a good movie based on it, that oh my god Gokuh is not Asian, etc. And when the first images and info were leaked, people just couldn't believe their eyes, that Gokuh was on High School when he was supposed to be a child, that he has no tail, that casting was plain wrong, and that Gokuh's hair was a failure if compared to the manga/anime's, therefore movie was faeces.Seriously, how can ANYBODY dare post a comment like that based on the hair of character of a movie that has no had any kind of official nothing released? (If you don't know what I am talking about, I am talking about the picture of Gokuh with a backpack in a parking lot, the first image leaked)I am saying this because I have read MANY comments like this, and I don't mean written by any stupid basement dweller blogging around, I have read these on truthful, reliable movie blogs (spanish blogs, I have to say), sources of information that are not supposed to take a side on anything, just inform with a little degree of subjectivity.And yet, people do not stop bashing their heads on the keyboard and see that the original DB manga/anime was not that good. We deem it good because we saw it through a child's eyes, we saw people flying around, shouting, throwing energy balls with their bare hands, GOD (which was a green alien) and those things that fit so well in the real world we live in.Anyway, there cannot be such a thing as a faithful DB movie. The original manga tells the story of an alien kid with a tail that becomes a huge monkey when full moon shines,rides a cloud and waves a stick that can become longer or shorter at command, is taught martial arts by an old man, has a friend with no nose, a friend who is afraid of women, a flying blue shape-shifting ¿cat?, a talking pig, and has to find 7 dragon balls to summon a dragon that will grant him one wish. I have to remind you geeks around the world who hate this movie, that the talking pig asks the dragon for some knickers, and oh my,the dragon gives him those knickers.Now imagine this on a cinema screen with real people. OH MY GOD it cannot be made, leave my childhood alone. Cluck you. Cinema is a business that can and does earn MILLIONS of dollars basing the scripts of their movies on things that already exist, whether these things are anime, manga, TV series, books, short stories, other movies. So if there can be a DB movie, there will be a DB movie.They had to change things from the original, of course they had, everything would have looked plain stupid otherwise.Gokuh is on HighSchool as his son was in high school in DBZ (right before the BuBu saga). And he is older because if you don't have a GOOD script(and I am thinking about AI, by Steven Spielberg) and the main character is a kid, your movie will be FOR kids. Who the cluck wants to see a kid doing stuff anyway?I have seen all the videos that there are around on the internet, and of course, people complain about action and humor and acting and everything, without regarding the original source, which was and is full of slapstick humor, and they complain about this very fact, arguing that if they change something, they should change it for good, this is, if they try to give it a more familiar and ""adult"" look, they should completely reject humor parts.I will make a FULL review WHEN I SEE THE MOVIE, I don't have my expectations high because I know EXACTLY what I am going to see, that is, a good dose of action, kicks, energy balls and entertainment. Yes, entertainment. Because entertainment is what the movies are for.And to finish, I have to say I grew up watching Dragon Ball and DBZ, and I was a really big fan, but hey, I grew out of it. I didn't like at all the first DB, I preferred DBZ much much better. And for those people that say that the final confrontation in the movie should be like the one between Neo and Agent Smith on MAtrix Revolutions...I simply have to say that in the Manga Gokuh cannot fly YET, mostly because he has not trained enough (why would he move around on a cloud if he could fly?). And I don't think that in the introduction movie of a saga (oh yes, I do hope they do more, usually sequels of ""hero"" movies are better than the first installments, suck on that) the main character will learn how to pull Kame Hame's, fly and fight, since all these three things are supposed to take a little training."
EdnaWelthorpe,amazing...unbelievable really,1/10,8 June 2010,"I saw the film for the first time recently on television and since I refused to see the film in theaters because the trailers showed what looked a godawful cash in of an adaptation, I thought ""I'll give it a shot, how bad can it be?"" For the first time, I can honestly say that it hurt to watch a movie. Seriously, watching this movie left me in physical pain, that's how bad it was.Like many, I grew up following Dragonball Z. Actually I had seen Dragonball first but only a few episodes and then it was years before I found DBZ and I was hooked. Sure in hindsight the stories were flimsy and contained more padding than a junior high school student but I was drawn in by characters like Gohan and Krillin as well as the fighting scenes when they did happen.Enough happy times, time for the plot of this movie. Goku is a young, happy boy living by himself in the woods, he is freakishly strong and has a tail and completely ignorant to the outside world until -- oh I'm sorry, that's actually the original storyline from Akira Toriyama. No, instead we have Goku in high school.GOKU IN HIGH SCHOOL!? Not even 15 minutes and already this film is ruined but wait, it gets even WORSE! Not only is Goku in high school but Goku is, as one youtube critic put it: ""a whining little crapsack who never smiles."" Did I also mention that they took away his tail? Then we have Bulma, played Emma Rossum doing a fantastic impression of a wooden cutout...oh and they also screwed up her character. Yes in the anime she was shallow, cowardly and selfish but you know what, she was actually the most normal character in the anime, aside from being a super-genius that is. DBE's Bulma seemed more like a Bond-girl reject, a gun toting Jean-Claude Van Damme wannabe. Oh and I love how she doesn't have blue hair because the creative ""talents"" thought it would be unrealistic...THE SHOW HAS DINOSAURS, SPACE ALIENS THAT CAN DESTROY PLANETS WITH A FINGER, TALKING ANIMALS, HOUSES COMING FROM CAPSULES AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST MACGUFFIN'S THERE IS AND THEY THINK BULMA HAVING BLUE HAIR IS UNREALISTIC!? And then there's Master Roshi...they just didn't even try to be faithful. Not even a beard, just Chow Yun-Fat waiting for his hopefully massive pay check.And don't me started on Chi-Chi, Yamcha or Piccolo. I'm actually amazed they found a way to make Yamcha's character even more useless than Toriyama did in DBZ.This film is awful! Just a complete and utter neutering of a flagship franchise. Yes changes are expected BUT TO BASICALLY GIVE A GIANT MIDDLE FINGER TO WHAT AKIRA TORIYAMA PRODUCED IS UNFORGIVABLE!"
galaxia6,This movie was rushed !!,2/10,23 September 2009,"OK the concept of the Idea was good I see the director is very good the storyline could have been good however why was this picture squezed it could have been great if the movie took time to look at some aspects deeply (also Goku wished Back Master Roshi but he knew he could also wish back his grandfather ?? no moral dilemma ""granpa ill do that next time sorry"" thats the least he could say and yes the deadth scene ? reminded me of the Batman of The Future WTF was it necessary even for him to die ???Goku for the first time went to a party and Picollo just had to attack now XD:)...I laughed really) To much characters kicked out the main Antagonist wonderful its the first movie I seen when the Antagonist was how do you put it not present (guys it actually only worked for the Lord of The Rings) Picollo had the right for some screen time most viewers expect to know something about the bad guy yes we want to see him listen to him understand his chain of thoughts come on people don't get bad ass just like that ! There's no such thing as absolutely good person and absolutely evil person the battle of the characters is the aspects of to conflicting truths the good guy dosen't only kill the bad guy he should lecture the bad guy where that bad guy made his errors thats what most of the heroes do not only in anime look at Dark Knight !!! I think it would be to long for this form of comunication to point out all the errors of this (could have been) fantastic movie and thanks to some ignorance of the PRODUCERS we have a crap as ussual"
ani_mystik,This movie was Excellent,10/10,28 March 2009,"The story was definitely mixed up a bit, fusing some elements of certain points of the actual story so that they could be DONE with Dragonball and Work on with DBZFor all of you Whiney boo hoo babies out there that are mad about the changes...don't watch the movie because you simply will not like itit stays completely true to the series and adds a more realistic touch to it. and thats that. If you haven't already seen this movie and you know that you aren't expecting DragonBall 100% then go see it, if you want 100% Dragonball with all the goods then go make one and then lets have a chat. but as for me i loved the movie, and im a HUGE fan of the series, i can tell all the changes that they've made but hey heres the thing, WATCH the movie 1 time, then compare and contrast the 2nd time don't walk in all OMG this is gonna suck big time they spoiled DB for life"
giddeo,"Its Dragon BALL! not Dragon Ball Z, remember how that used to look",10/10,6 April 2009,"Let me just explain, the animation on the original Dragon Ball cartoon was so bad that they used to take one shot of scenery and scroll it endlessly whenever people were ether driving, flying or running. It was sketchy to say the least. You don't get the same characters, the whole thing was aimed at children, I personally could not watch more then a few episodes. It was terrible. Dragon Ball Z was awesome, Dragon Ball was poor.NOW! This film is nowhere near as bad as everyone is making out. I liked the original Mortal Kombat and to say this movie is as bad as that is a bit harsh. I liked Goku's character, he had the same sort of cheekiness I think and I don't know I entered the thing with an open mind. I don't mind if the effects aren't that great because for me its just nice to see these characters brought to life.The smartest move they made was to start with Dragon Ball, not Dragon Ball Z, because they still have that target audience.Yes this could have been done better, but look at the costumes and the casting. Does this film look as though it had a block buster budget?I think the actors did the best job they could with what they had, I think the effects were pretty good and chow yung fat was pretty cool. Go back and watch a handful of episodes from Dragon Ball, not Dragon Ball Z and you might just appreciate what they've done.I've given this film a 10 purely to kick it out of that 3 star status which I feel is a bit harsh.Look at it this way, you have people familiar with Dragon Ball Z who are drawing direct comparisons, when the two series are drastically different and you have die hard fans who are never going to be satisfied with the movie because you can't squeeze ten years of characters and story line into one movie.In reality I would give this a 7 because the money just wasn't spent on this movie and the graphics could have been better. There are also some pretty big plot holes, for examples the Oozaru is not gargantuan as it is in the series and Goku is able to tame his Oozaru transformation using sheer will power... That's a pretty big plot hole because the whole point is that he shouldn't be able to do that and when he finally is able to tame the Oozaru power in the series it allows him to become super saiyan 4 I think, something like that. So making GT might be a stretch perhaps.I don't know I'm a pretty big DBZ fan and I didn't feel overly let down. I liked the characters and the way they were played out.See it, draw your own conclusions"
jacawol,Definitely worth watching,8/10,21 May 2010,"Having never been exposed to the Dragonball franchise, this film could not ruin any preconceptions that I may have had were I a fan of the original series. Coming into this film with a blank slate, I was impressed and entertained throughout. The action scenes were good, Goku's character progression was well done and I even liked the song at the end during the credits. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to see a light-hearted action movie. Obviously fans seem to universally hate this film, but that must be because it is roughly based in the Dragonball universe, not a direct adaptation. As a stand alone product there is very little wrong with this movie.

dechong,its okay as a movie but as an dragon ball adaption it sucks,5/10,26 May 2009,"I watched this movie tonight because i was bored and because i am a great fan of the dragon ball franchise. 5 out of 10 is not much but it is more than the average ratings for this movie and i wanna explain why. Two reasons. The first is that it is still a good movie. it is not great but it is okay. The Dragonball Adaption part in it sucks as hell... Well the second reason for 5 points is that i am an optimistic Person. Now that everything is presented in an awful American way the second Movie could bring us to the real dragon ball story. And now its time to complain about the adaption. Well it simply isn't one. It is loosely based on the great stuff Toriyama created decades ago. Lets begin with the characters: Well Bulma loves fighting and guns... SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AFRAID OF EVERYTHING! Goku is a normal kid... HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE NAIVE WITH A REALGOOD HEART (and so its ridiculous that he has sex before killing piccolo) Roshi... at first i found Roshi well presented. He loves erotic stuff, behaves like he is the best fighter on earth... but that changes and he behaves like any other master in any other fantasy world rescue story. Chi Chi... what the hell is this? she is supposed to be very strict and naive but...hey a hot chick sells tickets. Yamchu is pretty cool but he has got no woman-phobia - big minus here. And right now for Piccolo: nothing to complain about him. Masters shows that he is someone who knows Dragonball (maybe the only one involved in this movie) and so he simply does a great Job. Now for the little things: There are many things a Fan is concerned about: no colored hair, normal non flying cars, MAi as piccolos helper (why no scene in which pilaf resurrects him?) but my biggest concern is this: why the F*** is Gokus ""giant ape"" Form Piccolos puppet and why is it not even Giant? And why on earth should Goku kill Roshi? Well, he killed Gohan but thats in the real Dragonball story and not in this thing. Why all the changes? Compare it to any other martial arts Fantasy action stuff and you will find no differences. Biggest mistake of the makers! Dragonball never claimed to be as any others Dragonball was something special. No normal kid in high school (Goku in a high school? he probably would have kicked the teachers right in their faces... by accident ^^)no normal love story (goku is supposed to be ""forced"" into loving chi chi) Well lets hope for better days and a better sequelP.S.: By the way: no balded monk as an companion for Goku"
TyLee896,Flawless!,10/10,22 September 2012,"Dragonball is a great adaptation to a great anime series. I'm a true fan of the show and I absolutely loved this film. I really liked how the characters were portrayed, Goku was great, he plays a high schooler with chi chi. Throughout the entire film they both have a love connection between each other. My favorite character was Piccolo, The actor portraying him did a great job. Bulma plays a tough fearless character, really well too. Yamcha was good, master Roshi was great, and so was Gohan. The story is basic, Goku comes home only to find that his grandpa was killed, Goku then realises he must collect all 7 dragonballs before the eclipse. But in order to do that, he must defeat Oozaru and then defeat Piccolo. The effects were really good, the acting is phenomenal, the story was great, and the character development was really good. I hope we will see a sequel, I highly recommend this to die hard dragonball fans.-You have the power levels of a Boy Scout troop!- Freiza

ModKuraika,Even worse than anticipated?,3/10,14 October 2010,"Dragonball Evolution... Where do I begin? First off, I am a huge Dragon Ball fan, I own all the episodes for the original series, Z, and GT, seen them in both English and Japanese, viewed every movie, special, and OVA. Now that I've probably diminished my online reputation by that statement, let's talk about this terrible film.First off, when I heard that a film adaptation of my favorite anime/manga was going to be live-action, I had low expectations, the only way DB (especially Z) could be pulled off is a completely CG feature. And then... came the casting, much more displeased. Nothing more Dragon Ball-esquire than Goku going to high school, eh? Of course we do have the optimists, actually believing in some way that this film could be good. And then, the trailer. Oh, that trailer. When Ki looks like airbending, we have a problem. Seven mystics created the Dragonballs, eh? Oh, not the Nameks? Alright. Bulma using dual guns, with only one blue bang. Tomb Raider joke, anyone? Capsules now use Cybertronian technology apparently, and of course, the most epic line Goku could say, something we absolutely know Son Goku himself would say, ""I'm not ready for this"".Then came the movie, which astounded me. I had such low expectations for the film, it really surprised me when the film was worse than I had initially expected it would be. If not succeeding as an adaptation, I thought it would have at least served as a mindless action flick, and even at that it fails. The acting is horrid, the script is flimsy, the screenplay is corny, the effects look 8-10 years old, the music is easily forgettable, and the climax is so short and unsatisfying that you might need to watch Street Fighter and Super Mario Bros. to get the bad taste out of your mouth. I had hoped for little things, like the Kamehameha being at least somewhat cool, fail. Piccolo being interesting to watch, fail. Well, they probably at least make the Oozaru and Shenron look epic! ...Oh. Are you serious? Hulk is bigger than the Oozaru! Shenron is... speechless... and brown... and small... and with rejuvenating red breath... Big Red product placement, maybe? But the worst part of the film was Yamcha, no contest. What is he doing there? Where's Krillin, for one? And I cannot believe the film hints at a sequel, oh its there, people. Dragonball 2: Reborn. Excited? Exhilirated? I'm looking forward to having my childhood sodomized with a rusty spear. I hope other Dragon Ball fans out there are too."
Firemerk2001-1,Better than the Bootleg...but that's not saying much.,2/10,11 April 2009,"After seeing the bootleg and screaming as my eyes burned...I felt that Dragonball was dead. After seeing the bootleg, I felt a little raped as some of you have felt as well.So I decided that I still needed to see the film on the big screen for a couple of reasons. One-felt like I had to since Dragonball was by far my favorite cartoon and had to pay respect to the creator who also was an executive producer of this film. Two-there were some extra minutes in this version than the bootleg...and yes, it's very obvious where the cuts are in the bootleg. It was really bad.So I took my girlfriend who had no idea what Dragonball was about. Before the film started, I gave her a summary of the cartoon so she would at least have some idea of what the film was going to be about. She looked confused about some things, but that is understandable.So when the film started, they gave a brief summary about what happened to Piccolo. There were some things I liked about the intro to the film, but there were some things that I did not like. It seemed a little to short for an intro in my opinion. Seemed like the people that had no idea about dragonball, or the characters, were a little cheated in a way. It was poor character development for Piccolo.It then goes on and we meet Goku as a teenager. Now a lot of people have been complaining about Justin Chatwin (I have been to) and I must say....I take back some of things I have said about the dude. A lot of people wanted an Asian Goku...maybe to show respect...or simply because they thought he was more Asian than white. In my opinion...I don't really care. Some of his facial expressions were great.I'm not going to go through every single scene and break it down...so let's just go to what I didn't like and what I did like.Things I liked: The composed music is amazing. It brings the movie alone up a few ratings. Good job Brian Tyler, you have done it again. The extra minutes in the film made the film better without a doubt compared to the bootleg. There wasn't any hardcore cutting to where you are like ""wait, what just happened?"" A specific scene I am talking to is when the bully runs over Goku bikes. To those who have seen the bootleg and the U.S version, you know what I'm talking about. I thought the special effects were just OK. The big fight scene at the end was actually better to watch in the theatre.Things I didn't like: I understand that the cartoon had a lot of cheesy dialogue, but I feel it didn't work in this film. They tried to go for a more realistic sense and the dialogue just didn't work in a lot of places...especially with Goku at the end. The fighting needed to be better. I think the best fight scene in the entire film had to be at the beginning with Grandpa Gohan and Goku.I think everyone will agree with me on this one...Goku in high school is the main thing I did not like in this film. Goku asking how to get girls? No.....*shakes head*....just no. Why? Why not just have him at his grandpa's house? He didn't need to go to school...he could have just met chi chi...I don't know, I just think that part of the story should have been different.OK...If anyone who wants to see the film...but is just afraid...if you have any questions...go ahead and ask...but i will say this...it's better than the bootleg...So my official review of the film...bootleg version: 3/10 Official Version: 5/10 If there is a sequel...then I will say this...have better choreography fights. And the direction was not as bad as I thought it was going to be...but man oh man...get a better story and a bigger budget for the effects. PLEASE GET A BETTER STORY!! THAT'S ALL I ASK FOR OUT OF ANYTHING!"
kenny-242,"Poor, but not a catastrophe",4/10,3 June 2018,"Dragonball Evolution a motion picture that tells the story of Goku, adopted and trained Gohan. In a race to save the world from annihilation frin the evil Piccolo, he teams up with motion picture equivalents of Bulma, Roshi and Yamcha. Chi Chi also makes a nice appearance. The script tries to narrow down volumes of Dragonball comic books into a cinematic movie. Considering this movie lasts less than 2 hours, its an honest try. If you watch the movie trying to cover all the gimicks, characters and details out of the comic books, you will be disappointed. If not angry. This is a motion picture, and no way will it ever be able to encompass all of the details and love from the comics books. Keep that in mind, when you sit down and press play.In retrospective, the script writer and special effects team could have done themselves a few easy favors. Details that could have been added to make a poor movie a bit more credible and a lot more loyal to the comic books and animated series:When Gokus Reverts to his Saiyan self, he turns into an angry looking werewolf rather than a monstrous ape. I recommend the team study the incredible Hulk, either in the 00's movies or in Avengers. -The Lookout (Kami-sama no Shinden) has been reduced to a semi sized hindenburg space wessel rather than the religious outpost I recall.The cosmetics team could've done a lot more to make Piccolo look properly. Instead of the dark body armor, a proper Namekian atire would've made it much easier to link the movie character to the books. Apart from his clothing, his demeanor and expressions are still very far from the Picolo I know. To me the movie character resembled darth maul more than my favorite green alien.Evil Piccolos defeat also marks the birth of Piccolo Jr. The Namek we all love so dearly. A small happy ending detail that could've added a nice touch.Wheres the tournament? We get a brief glimpse of the worlds martial arts tournament. Nothing builds up suspense and drama like martial arts tournaments. The tournament would've made such an easy and dramatic way to introduce the many chararcters in the Dragon Ball universe. The movie misses out on a perfect opportunity to turn a youthful pervy master Roshi into the old funny fart we all love. In the movie he completes the Mafu Ba, trying to capture evil King Piccolo. In the proces he is derived of his life force. Rather than dying from it, the movie could have let him age considerably. That would twist the movie script onto tha tof the comic books.Those are just a few details, that would've helped convince me a bit more."
amy101802,what the ??!!,1/10,21 May 2009,"I have close to a 100 friends and we all at one time went to go see the movie. We all left with in an hour time. We though the movie was going to like the anime serious. That was the worst film in my life, Dragon ball is a young child from another planet. That was sent to earth to destroy it, then came a old man name Gohan that found the child and the rest is history. Whats next Dragon ball z the return of piccolo, come on man you basically destroyed the dragon ball world with that movie. I think if you want to redeem yourself need to count this one as a loss and start over, go back to movie people and say with all the negative feed back we need to start over. And call this movie DRAGON BALL ""THE Beginning"" start the movie off with Frieza destroying planet veg eta. Do it the right way and the 90 million fans will love you for it.

warakalabot,Is there such a thing as Movie Rape?,1/10,26 May 2009,"Five minutes into the movie, i already started picturing James Wong's face and imagining how good it would feel like to put my hands around his neck and slowly squeeze the air around his tiny little head. that, in that moment, would have felt really, really satisfying. compared to the trauma i felt as i watched the anime i grew up with, woke up to everyday, begged my mom to stay up five minutes more to watch, and literally the pinnacle of my childhood, get raped and ravaged beyond any form of repair.i couldn't bear to watch the movie. if you are any loyal fan to the series, you'd know perfectly well what i'm talking about. it hurt so bad just watching it. words can't even begin to explain the absolute horror this movie made me feel. i felt disgusted as i walked out the theater. barely felt like myself for the whole week.what happened? why did they such a thing? why? the movie is beyond awful. the story was not a DragonBall-worthy one. i'd rather watch the Japanese version of Spiderman rather than watch this. the lead actor was a douche. why they chose him, i really don't know. thy could have casted anyone else and it would have been way better acting. heck, they could have signed the fat guy from LOST and it would have been a far better choice. all the elements from the legendary DB series were distastefully mutilated and crapped on. yes. crapped on. with matching flies and what not.i could go on and on and on about how this movie made me want to commit homicide and systemic annihilation of the cast and crew, but it would take me years to actually finish. bottom line is, if you've seen even just single episode of DB, stay as far away from this movie as possible. for those who have not heard of DB and want to watch this, please don't. Dragon Ball is nowhere near as lame as this movie. my heart goes out to all of us who felt like Goku was raped. i just wish the people who thought this up would suffer a similar fate.am i angry? yes i am. what am i gonna do about it? nothing. Hollywood will forever be Hollywood. uncaring. irresponsible. and inhuman. no thing will ever change."

remijohannessen,About This,1/10,22 May 2009,"The problem here is making a movie with no feelings for the fans or even try to make it resemble the original story from the anime. The fact that Goku is white is the worst.I expect a small cute Chinese guy with wild hair and a monkey tale being picked up by an old Chinese man. This should be the introduction of a great movie. (then they release another half a year/year later) Then they can skip some story and start some action on the next movie. Make some more movies.Go back with a flashback story in each movie,making people understand more and more of the story until it can just go on with the fighting and fun.I wish they could withdraw this movie,apologize.And start over. Find a freak of nature that knows everything about Dragonball,mix it with some matrix effects,and top it with characters that resembles.Believe ""Frodo"" in LOTR be black? or terminator without Arnold? I sure hell can not. They are based on the true story and the characters had to be them. Search china.Gotta be at least one out of billions and Remake this.If they made this cause they wanted to make a better one right after,I will laugh of the joke and wait for it.When you have the script you don't change it, you read it!

chocky005,Movie is OK for what I expected,9/10,4 April 2009,"I have just seen the Movie in Aus and I found the movie OK. From everything I heard I went in thinking this would be a movie as if Disney made it. Whether or not you think the movie should have been made this way dose not really matter it's the way it is so deal with it. It's a silly fun kid's movie, however bad some people may say the movie is most will agree the CGI in a lot of the movie is pretty good and shows promise. Sometimes the Acting was silly I did not like it when Goku started talking slow at a few points in the movie it made him sound stupid. Before you go to this movie please remember a few things. 1. Its PG not M or R so there is not a lot of strong violence in it. 2. it's taken from Dragon Ball not Dragon ball Z. Also to add it's not a copy of the comic it a different version with similar characters from the Cartoon. Like the first Xmen movie. I suggest you see the movie if only to bring up the figures so we can get a second movie and get to the good part of Dragon ball Vegeta.REMEMBER!! This movie is a ""silly fun kid's movie"" not a copy of the comic, books and some TV shows are always better than movies as movies are restricted on time and you can't not develop the story as much. Go to the movie and have fun, don't worry about how good or bad you think the movie may be."
bobbytzeyanglee,I want those seven dragonball...,1/10,24 May 2009,"... because I have a wish. I wish I haven't paid 888 Taiwan Dollars to watch this absolute waste of a film!!! What a screw up!!! Its the worst film ever!!!Justin Chatwin sucks at his acting. For once, even 2 sexy girls (Emmy ROssum and the sexy Japanese chick who plays Picolo's henchwoman, forgot her name's spelling) cannot save me from foul mouthing this goddamn waste of a film. A literal waste of talent, money, time, etc. Only thing that keeps me from walking outta the theatre is Chow Yun Fatt, he is as cool as he is since his performance in The Killer (1989)I wouldn't ela borate much on how much this film sucked... other users have already mentioned on that. But here's my verdict...Words possible to describe Dragonball Evo4 words - Absolute Waste of Time 3 words - Don't Watch It 2 words - Rip Off 1 word - suckedBye bye :)"
shastar,"I really, really wanted to hate this movie...",6/10,11 April 2009,"But, for the life of my, I can't understand why I actually let myself be entertained by this. Yes, they took extensive liberties with the plot and characterizations, but for them to compress all of Dragonball down into an 86 minute long movie, some changes needed to be made, and in all, they really weren't that bad. What came out after all the Hollywood meddling was an actually fairly decent little action movie. Inoffensive, mildly entertaining, and with enough of the source material in it to make it recognizable. Justin Chatwin was serviceable as Goku, Emmy Rossum made a very good Bulma, and I don't think I could have picked anyone better that Chow Yun-Fat as Master Roshi. All the rest of the characters fall into the ""good enough"" level. It was actually refreshing to see him go back to his comedy roots a bit for this film. I am really perplexed at the people screaming, ""No Plot! OMG!!!"" this movie had just as much plot as the entire rest of the series of DB at any given time. DB isn't complex political intrigue or multi-layered character study. It's about people that fight. Period. The plot that was presented in this movie serviced that well enough. Another complaint is that this wasn't epic enough. What people seen to forget is that Dragonball, in it's very early days, started just as small as this movie. People didn't get thrown through mountains in the early days. Early Dragonball was more akin to Indiana Jones than the earths crust smashing excess that it became.If you want to hate this movie because of the flaws, fine, go ahead and hate. Just leave those of us that turned our brain off and enjoyed the movie for what it was alone."
stephenboud,master piece,10/10,16 May 2009,"The movie seemed much shorter than it really is because it was constantly moving. There weren't any inappropriate lulls. There was some ""corny"" humor, but definitely not enough to spoil the actual funny parts. Great effects, of course. Bulma did a wonderful job as main character, although it seems odd that she becomes so comfortable with gokus presence in her life in such a short amount of time. There's a lot of parts that are totally unreal, but I guess if you're going to see a movie about machines that turn into rational robots, you can't expect too much reality. For those who tend to pick apart movies, there are a lot of unexplained instances throughout the movie that you can mull over later, but all in all, a must see in the movie theaters. Hopefult they'll be a sequel :)PS. ""did you do that?""""...Yeah I did""

I watched quit a few movies and all I can tell is, there are lots of garbage movies with a rating around 6 to 7. this movie is a solid 6 or 7 if it comes to the movie itself, but unfortunately people are not rating the movie but how bad it is compared to the real deal: dragonball. dragonball is a 20 on the scale. that's how awesome it is and that's why people are so angry.I guess most people expected dragonball evolution to easily become the ""best movie ever made"" since it is based on the most successful anime ever made.and since it failed to be as awesome as the anime, its a 0. what logic...i'm very sorry for ya ""fans"" to not being able to enjoy this movie

dark_scionproductions,What to say that hasn't already been said?,1/10,28 June 2012,"Spoilers ahead here people, but really...do you care? It's Dragonball Evolution...Let's get it out of the way first, eh. I'm a Dragonball Fan, I've got the whole collection on both DVD and Manga, so I was one of 'those' fan-boys who literally went apesh*t when this movie came out-though I'd been dreading it for over a year before hand, so you can guess what my opinion is of this. I've rarely thought that there's a movie out there that can be as bad as DB:E is, if not from a fan of the series, then as a fan of any of the genre's that they tried to stuff in there. It doesn't work as a group hero journey, it doesn't work as a martial arts movie(some of the worst choreography I've ever seen, including TV) it doesn't work as a reluctant hero movie. Nothing works for it, why you might be asking-well I'll try and explain without raging. Where-if you're adapting a movie from ANY other medium, you'll have to make compromises to get the movie to have a realism(as a fan, if I'd seen Goku with his hair from the Manga, I would have hated this more-if that's possible) and understanding the cuts and changes that need to be made shouldn't get the fan-boy/girl rage going on, it does but what can you do about it. Yet if you want the film to succeed, then-at some point, you'll need to acknowledge the success that gave you the green light to make the movie in the first place. And while some movies have chosen to emulate the themes in the original source, most just stick a label of whatever they want and write the worst stories possible( I mean, after the Original Batman, did it 'really' have that much to do with Bruce Wayne being the Dark Knight, or was it just the crazies that he just had to have try to take over his city?) this is the first major flaw with the entire theme of Dragonball.For the uninitiated among you, Dragonball is set in a world that is-at both times, a futuristic fantasy world, and a prehistoric wilderness, where the young boy called Goku lives in the wild, hunting and feeding himself by killing giant monsters like T-Rex's(yes, T-Rex's) he meets up with a young scientist girl called Bulma, who is on a quest to find and collect the seven Dragonball's of the title, she runs into Goku because he has one of them and they decide to travel the world together to find the other five balls. It's a simple premise that has been used many times before and since and probably will continue to for a long, long time, which IMO is one of the reasons of Dragonballs huge success.With the movie we have almost none of that, the whimsical journey is lost almost immediately when we see that the 'evil king piccolo' is also searching for them, so it's basically the plot of Lord of the Rings 1-3 all in one movie with a poorly written script. They took the plethora of story possibilities and just dumped a 'hero v villain' story that didn't make any sense in the context of the story chronology. The acting-well, I'm not in agreement with most here, for what this movie is, the acting is pretty much on-par, nothing spectacular, nothing Uwe Boll worthy. The effects...eh, well with a budget of $30 million, you'd expect some of it to go on getting somewhere near decent effects, I mean District 9 had only that and it's effects were brilliant. Yet nothing about the effects shouts Dragonball-at all, it's terrible, there's better vidoes of Dragonball powers on youtube. The characters, oh the characters...where do I begin with the characters. Y'know, I wouldn't have mind some plot changes, some ideas missing, if there had been at least one part where you see interesting characters that actually seem like there comic/anime counterpart. If there's been-oh, 12 animated shows with four full movies about batman that fit his comic persona along and two movies about superman that fit the story, why not have some of the ideas in Dragonball fit? Well I doubt people will get an answer for that, because there's 'nothing' about these characters that fit the Dragonball counterparts.This is a terrible movie, I don't know whether to say it's the worst that we're ever gonna see-as there's a Death Note and Bleach movie in the works-but if I believed in a God, I would pray to him that this remain the worst thing I ever see(well, apart from The Room)."
akhtarneruda,No. 1 Movie From the Bottom,3/10,21 June 2022,"This is the No. 1 Movie from the bottom. Meaning it's the worst movie, ever.I thought Avatar the Last Airbender was the single most unfaithful adaption in all of movie history, but Dragonball Evolution makes that movie seem like it's the most faithful thing ever.None of the characters looks like their anime counterparts, Piccolo looks like Martian Manhunter in Zack Snyder's Justice League. For some reason, there's both Airbending as well as the Force used in this movie, even though I have never seen those once in the anime. Most of the characters here barely act like their anime counterparts. I swear, if the name ""Dragonball"" wasn't slapped on the title and the characters had different names I would've thought this was just some random action-fantasy movie.But if you're not a fan of the anime, then trust me, this movie would STILL be awful.Its storyline is stupid and is filled with more plot holes than Swiss cheese. The MC and the love interest have absolutely zero chemistry with each other. The acting is either bland or too over-the-top. The CGI is extremely poor, and while I know they're limited with a rather small budget, it's still more terrible than what it should have been.Though, credit where credit is due, the fight scenes are so ridiculous they are funny and Roshi's actor is also extremely silly, which makes him funny. If not for those, I would've rated this a 1 instead of a 3."
jamesrgirouard,I LOVED it but then again I'm not big on DBZ cartoon,10/10,1 July 2021,"I loved this film. It's so good. One of my all time faves. I enjoyed the King Piccolo Saga of Dragonball which is what this movie was adapted from. If you pay close attention they do have some stuff (or pay homage to) from the cartoon. It has a great message ""always have faith in who you are"" for kids and adults alike. I'm not too big on DBZ cartoon but this film I totally love. Cheesy yes. Bad? You could say. But I absolutely love it.

stelmarkou,Second rate effects with second rate actors,7/10,3 December 2010,"I grew up watching Dragonball so I was looking forward to watching this film.I was very surprised that for a cartoon as big as Dragonball they only had Yun-Fat Chow as a well known actor in the film. Unfortunately besides Yun-Fat Chow, Justin Chatwin and Jamie Chung the rest of the cast look like the should be doing low budget Disney TV series.Story line isn't very straight forward and you will probably need to watch it a couple of times to fully understand it.The one thing you can take from this film are the fighting scenes. Better than I expected and well choreographed.

linkkickass,Subjective Report,10/10,10 April 2009,"Evolution develops a well, digested, adaptation to the manga, creating a story that can exist in the cinema and last the length of a movie. Chatwin's acting is deliberate and well controlled, developing Goku's charter into a person and not just an ideal. There are numerous accounts in the film where Justin resembles Goku such as his unsound logic (building a bridge of bodies to cross lava), a saiyan cannot alter his hair, and a thick, head strong personality. But what separates him from the manga character is that he develops into himself, moving from serving others to acting for himself. Overall Justin provides many expressions without being strictly serious or comical. Emmy Rossum gives the new role of Bulma as a workaholic dedicated to her fortune to fame. Yamcha is displayed as a junkie, with a mellow attitude, hustling for quick cash. Roshi is a fallen hero who was selfish and left the world behind for cheap pleasure. His encounter with Goku brings him to realize what he rejected as myth is real, and like a soldier called back into action he is reborn. Piccolo is the least developed character who simply remains as the symbol of aggression without motivation(think John Carpenter's Halloween). Chi-Chi is just as dominant as she was in the manga, giving a feel for control of her destiny when she notices Goku. The movie's settings become mystical and unworldly with Piccolo's presence, the phantom camera used provides a clear image that cannot be compared. There also is a great attention to detail with the costumes and props. The special effects differ, providing a unique element for Piccolo's minions and Oozaru. The styles of fighting is what seems to not be fully developed; while they reflect the basic scenes from the show (punch in the face, fast paced fighting, colliding head-on and shooting off into the sky) they do not seem visually realistic in the film, instead they appear cartoonish. Finally, the movie feels as if each scene was cut to the minimum in order to reduce the length, this may make it confusing when details are overlooked(as when Goku changes outfits). Regardless of the plot, acting, and effects this movie provides a better interpretation of Dragonball over any of the animated films."
RocShemp,A fun time as long as you're expecting an adaptation and not a live-action re-enactment of the comics/cartoon,8/10,10 April 2009,"I just came back from seeing this. It was a lot of fun and, much to my delight, it's truer to the spirit of Dragonball than Dragonball Z.Chow Yun-Fat steals every scene he's in and really got the personality of Roshi 100%. The kid playing Goku was surprisingly good in the role. I like the real world approach to his every day life (all the stuff at the high school) but I also appreciate that they kept that brief so as not to outstay its welcome. I was also surprised to see that Akira Toriyama served as executive producer for the movie.It's basically a fun quest movie that manages not to drag or outstay its welcome. That said, I feel that the film may have gotten cut a lot in order to make the runtime leaner. There are some awkward cuts here and there. The most that stands out in my mind is when Yamcha first meets Roshi. There's a funny misunderstanding when Yamcha offers Roshi a fist bump. While the gag is in full swing, the scene suddenly cuts to Yamcha drilling a hole through a wall so they can reach the next Dragonball.I wouldn't be surprised if there is an extended cut on BD/DVD and I'd be all for it since there are some loose threads/plot holes the film proper never addresses.**SPOILERS** It's never explained how Piccolo escaped his prison. It's never explained how Roshi expected the new Ma Fu Ba seal to work with only his life essence when it took the lives of seven mystics to seal Piccolo in the first place. It is also never addressed why Mai serves Piccolo. **SPOILERS**I would also have liked just a little more time (though not so much time that it would totally veer into Dragonball Z territory) spent in the Toi San tournament.Anyhoo, it's a good movie and I'll gladly watch it again and purchase the eventual BD release.Oh and it's nice to see Ernie Hudson still getting work, even if it was just an extended cameo at best.I'd also like to add that the score by Brian Tyler was very good and anyone who enjoyed it should definitely pick up a copy of soundtrack CD as the music holds up quite well on its own."
andrew_amezcua2,just shut up already!!!!,6/10,21 April 2009,"I am afraid that I am going to be the one that will have to defend this movie, OK OK i understand that the movie was not true to the anime but i feel that the movie was OK. It was not the greatest movie that i have ever seen but its not the worst. I am a REAL Dragonball, Dragonball Z fan. and this is the time where the real fans come out to defend the movie. I know that the movie did not have the greatest script ever and they were missing some characters like Krillin but i feel that you can't have the movie exactly like the cartoon or else its not believable, like Turtle, Oolong and Puar they honestly don't belong in the live action, but as far as it being one movie well I don't like to be one of those people that say ""If i was (blank)"" but If I was the director or writer i would of made the movie into three parts and not try to squish all of it into one movie"

edepedro-08045,It doesn't deserve all that hate.,6/10,19 December 2019,"Honestly, i understand why people usually don't like this film. It has no faithfullness to the manga and anime, and it has a very lame script. But a long time ago, when i was a DB fan, i liked this film. I enjoyed watching it. And i also liked to see the differences between this and the source material.On the technichal level, it was pretty good. The scenarios are good-looking and the fight choreographies are pretty good.What makes me sad about this film, is that people hate it as if it was a second holocaust. As if this film caused any death. And they exaggerate. This film is decent, but honestly, i would watch it if the showed it on TV.

jeroenschoester,"late comment, but still...Bad!",3/10,1 August 2009,"i just saw this movie yesterday because my friends said its awful. so i went watching the anime series of dragon ball again cause i forgot some. the anime was great and funny. uve probably written this a lot of times, but somehow the director managed to screw this one up pretty good.first thing, goku is about 16 years old while in the anime he is about 10 years old, and important, he has a TAIL! Gohan is already dead, but in the movie he's still alive and got killed by piccolo. thats not even that worse, it gives some twist to it thats not to bad. ow, and goku is in school. so far the anime goes, he didn't knew there was more then his grandpa until bulma came.2nd thing, they left out some of the star players in this movie, and made some characters look bad. roshi looks like a complete full. in the anime he is crazy but funny. here he is just and idiot. and where are krillin and tien and tiau zu.also the containment wave, in the movie they needed some sort of special containment box-thingy. in the anime a bottle was good enough, as long as u could close it. and whats with this eclipse? goku could turn into a big ape every full moon what strange enough happened a couple time in this movie. also when he is in the ape form, he can not be controlled what he surprisingly could in this movie.next is that he was in love with chi-chi, what also seemed a bit weird in the beginning, and got worse during the movie. DB(not Z or GT) isn't a love story, with a lot of romance between those 2 until the end where they marry. its also a pity they didn't brought the ox-king in this movie ( the father of chi-chi ), cause that is one of the funniest characters in the anime if he is in.last the Kamehameha-wave and shen long. I'm not sure how a Kamehameha-wave can bring someone back to life with it destructive power, but OK. goku has to live, how ever if was weird that he was almost killed by 1 single gun shot. in the anime bulma shot him between the eyes and all goku had was pain. but OK. and the way to do the wave was also a bit strange.the dragon was just a big disappointment. from all the special effects, which some were still OK, i hoped this would be the movie's big final. but how a complete waste. the dragon was so freaking small, and yellow-gold-like. and he didn't freaking talk. he should have been long, and rolled in a wide circle, and be freaking green with gold-yellow spike-thingy's on the back. and his voice must be also there. he looks impressive in the anime, but here he just doesn't do it.the only reason i gave this movie 3 stars is because some effects were nice, and i liked some fighting scenes.probably a bit late, but don't go to this movie if u haven't done it so far."
falco12351,the 7th worst film adaptation I have ever seen,1/10,16 August 2013,"What do you get when you hire a writer who never watched Dragon ball in his whole life who obviously just goggled dragon ball and started writing a mediocre kids movie with a Dragon ball theme? You get a Disastrous, Disappointing Insult to the franchise, Every actor is miscast the Fiction is completely inaccurate, the story is poorly written, the special effects look dated, there are so many missing characters from the show like: Krillin, Korin, Kami, Mr Popo, Vegeta even the Ox King is nowhere to be seen.Akira Toriyama had input for this movie that Hollywood completely ignored and this is what they get for ignoring the creator, this movie is in the same league as Speed Racer it tries too hard to appeal to the new generations and ignores old generations you know the generations that grew up watching the show. I can't find one positive thing in this movie this movie basically killed the dragon ball franchise, Just watch the show and Avoid this garbage the show is legendary this movie is horrible."
lxmerrifield,"Why, Is What I really want to know",1/10,21 August 2013,"Honestly what were they thinking when they made this i was looking forward to this for some time but to have butchered it this badly, it's like they were making fun of the original series and spitting in it's face I do realize that it's difficult to make an awesome live action film from an awesome anime series but it's like they didn't even try. To turn the KaMeHaMeHa into a complete and utter joke like they did was one thing that got me angry it was like they were doing dance moves to pull of that attack and what came out was something that looked like blue liquid flame rather than a solid attack with good power that can destroy something. the only part I enjoyed was that i thought chi chi was smoking hot that's it everything else was lame. Lets talk about roshi, he want from being a super pervert who read porn magazines to a semi pervert who looked at swimsuit magazines, it's not very funny that way. also Goku's innocence was non existent and he certainly shouldn't have pursued chi chi like he did plus his martial arts sucked and he didn't seem very superhuman. I won't start on how badly they failed with Bulma, but with the part about Goku turning into an ape was really lame the ape was to small and it appeared during an eclipse which was dumb too. Well I've had enough badmouthing this movie lets just hope they don't try this again for years and when they do they need to put more effort into it, and i mean a lot more effort."
toshguy,"Not really Dragon Ball, but not that terrible either",5/10,24 April 2023,"Let's just get it out of the way: this movie isn't really Dragon Ball. If you come into it with preconceptions of what Dragon Ball is and should be, you're obviously bound to be disappointed since Goku and co. Are nothing like their manga/anime progenitors. At several points, just as I was beginning to enjoy it as a camp fest, I'd cringe a bit when hearing names such as Goku and Bulma which reminded me of DB and how disrespectful this movie is of it. But I managed to get over it after the first 30 minutes or so and actually had fun. If it didn't have to live up to its name, the movie definitely wouldn't be highly regarded, but I don't think it would be bottom 14 on IMDb either.I'd say it's alright as a standalone turn-off-your-brain B-movie. Nothing special or memorable, just middle of the road in most respects and below that in some. A lot of reviewers put the effects down, but I'd say that considering the low budget, they're surprisingly good overall. Of course, they ain't Marvel level, but most of them are pretty convincing by 2009 standards and some even rise above B-movie status... Except for the ones in the final 15 minutes or so. The Oozaru and Shenlong are utterly laughable! I guess the budget was running out when they got to that part.The acting is decent overall and has some highlights such as Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi and Joon Park as Yamcha, both of whom are clearly enjoying camping it up. Speaking of camp, that's what this movie should be taken as. The bizarre hodgepodge of cliches from superhero movies, teen dramas/comedies, sci-fi, martial arts and mysticism can be nothing else.If you manage to disassociate it from the Dragon Ball franchise and simply view it as a campy B-movie, you might just enjoy yourself!"
prettypanda19,no justice.,1/10,30 December 2010,"This movie was a slow plane crash from beginning to end.The ANIME in itself was sooo good that I actually watched the entire DBE movie hoping that something would relate to the anime,but that wasn't the case.I apologize to Akira Toriyama for whoever was involved in destroying his world famous masterpiece. The same masterpiece that took America by storm even before the pokemon phenomena.The 3d animation, the actors chosen, the setting, the story, the fight scenes, the kamehameha wave, the anticlimactic ending, the roles, the execution...all wrong, stupid, pathetic.I pictured DBE to be more like The Matrix series mixed with The 5th Element, Final Fantasy Advent Children, and the X-Men series. (remember when they removed Cyclops glasses and his eyes shot this huge beam and blew a massive hole through the building roof? THAT was along the lines of a decent kamehameha wave)But what do I know? I've only been a fan for 17 years. Not 17 minutes."
casey-burrows,NOTHING AS GOOD AS THE CARTOON,2/10,20 November 2021,"For starters it was a shambles this is the only newish db movie out and people need to get together and do a MUCH better adaptation of this film, the only good thing was some of the beams they fire i.e effects, but fan made films have done better with looks, and better action.... hopefully one day they make a reboot...

docThugx,this movie is good for non db fanatics,6/10,7 March 2010,"This was a fine movie. it wasn't great. Before I rented it I read some reviews and after I watched it I thought I should post that it wasn't that bad. Some die hard DB fans wrote they hated it. Wasn't mad that I spent a dollar to watch it or that it took 2 hours of my life. One of my favorite movies was transformers. I am a gamer but not a db fan. This movie is good one to watch on HBO or rent for a dollar at the r box. If there is nothing on then I would watch this by myself late at night. Don't think I would watch it more than 2 or 3 times though. Not one to put in your collection of DVD's. If you have kids they might like it, there is no blood or naked girls. a little violent but nothing we haven't seen in other fight movies or game movies. I liked the special effects. It wasn't too long. You don't need to know the story to like the movie. The acting wasn't too bad and the girls were cute.

drvis-605-344052,Dragonball Evolution a total failure.,2/10,11 December 2009,"I too think the dragon ball evolution movie was a total failure. Nothing like the original anime series which i loved.The storyline was crap, the characters didn't match the personalities and looks of the anime (master roshi with full heir and way younger cmon!),i could go on a lot longer but i wanted to give my view on what could make a dbz movie work.I think they could easily have made a better or at least good storyline for the dragon ball movie.they could just follow the Radditz storyline for example: starting the movie with goku and chichi already married and celebrating the birthday of their son gohan, explaining of the dragon balls and piccolo, Grandpa gohan etc. in short flashbacks.. not like in this movie where goku is a geeky teenager who doesn't know his own capabilities etc! cmon he learned that along time sooner while fighting the red ribbon army and already having joined multiple world martial arts tournaments by that time!~ if they just followed the storyline of radditz/nappa & vegeta saga it would be way better, with a better cast and special effects, this could still make a box office hit wonder, since millions and millions of people in the world love DBZ! which child didn't knew about the series and loved it.. i can tell you as far as i know not a lot of people.and they could make it still so that people who never heard of it still understand it, by for example make a prelude (once upon a time.. etc.) where-after the movie starts."
MasterGokhan,A director could not humiliate a nr1 class anime any worst than this.,1/10,3 November 2010,"I'm sorry but I just cant say anything good about this movie. I watched the db/z/gt episodes for a long time and a lot of my friends just love the anime, but when it comes to this movie, I just wanted to cry, spit on the theater screen and leave the theater. Even I can make zillion times a better movie. The actors were crap, their voices were crap screenplay was crap,storyline was crap, and that Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha was so crappy it looked like a shiny cloud and nothing more. The director should be ashamed of his self for making this movie. Don't watch this movie. Stick with the anime, its the best. I just wish I had the money to make this movie, at least I know what the fans want to see."
majinlr101,Just See the Movie Yourself and Make Your Own Opinion,10/10,16 April 2009,"Let's just cut right to the chase and imagine that everyone knows that the title for the movie, ""Evolution"", isn't just for added syllables and the people behind this project were intentionally setting out to make something different from what we've already seen in the manga and the TV show. So that being said, I'm fine with the changes made to the movie. Goku as a high schooler is a great way to avoid all the tedious time it would've taken to introduce a mountain village child to the real world and him having to learn what everything is. Yamcha being just an odd surfer-dude/bro is fine, because honestly the guy didn't nothing for the series except hinder dragonball gathering and make jokes. Kuririn not in the movie, well his only purpose in the series was to rival Goku and push him to achieve better power, which he (kuririn) pretty much maxed out at after the first World Tournament, so its fine that he's not around making jokes. But onto more pressing matters. The things that really burdened me during the film was the lack of time taken to give any back story for certain characters: Why was Piccolo released from his prison? Why is Mai helping him (even better, who is Mai?) Why does Piccolo know that Goku is a saiyan (or Oozaru) just by looking at him even though he's been trapped in a kettle for about two thousand years? Most of these questions could be answered... by someone who's watched the show and can make quick assumptions by referring to their knowledge of the series. (we know that Pilaf and his gang released Piccolo and that would make sense for Mai to be a henchman, and we know that Piccolo is an alien and I guess he could spot a saiyan since he apparently worked with back in the day a couple thousand years ago) but for someone who's never known the series (which had be everyone who watched this movie over the weekend because clearly no self-respecting fan would've seen this movie, according to the blogs) this leaves open plot holes and really makes for a bad movie. Aside from the lackluster story writing (which might've been because of the writers strike ruining everyone's lives) the actors were delightful in who they were playing. Chatwin was a playful goku with extraordinary powers, Rossum was a feisty Bulma, Yun-Fat was a crazy old hermit, Park was a dude-esquire Yamcha, and Marsters... well Marsters was your stereotypical bad guy which is what King Piccolo was. Don't let the public thrashing of this film or your undying devotion to the show stop you from seeing this. It's just a cool little kids movie with some decent action and adventure in it.P.S. Goku was neither Japanese nor was he American in the series...he was a saiyan. P.P.S. Was the story ever set in Japan or any other kind of Asian country? No, it was set in a make-believe Earth with town and cities named after directions. The show just happened to be created by an Asian and was therefore produced for an Asian market in Japan. Much like this movie was filmed and produced in America, hence using American actors (for the most part.) Stop saying Goku was Japanese."
damgdscfmlcw,An insult for every DB fan,1/10,9 March 2010,"There has been a lot of exchange between US and Japanese cinema. Seven Samurai and The Glorious Seven. The Godzilla movie that was more like another Jurassic Park with a Monster that didn't even look like Godzilla. Etc.But this movie. This movie is a absolute train wreck. Everyone who knows (not even likes) DB will tell you this movie is a train wreck. It is an insult to the intelligence of DB fans. There have been bad movies that, 10-20 years later gained entertainment value... This movie wont! It will always stay the steaming pile of **** it is. Self-respecting DB fans hate it and people who don't care won't watch it.Like Godzilla this movie has only the name in common with the original. The rest is annoying, insulting crap. DB fans just watch the trailer and as soon as they see Goku they'll know they hate this movie.This movie is so bad that despite it having already 407 reviews I took the time to register with IMDb and to tell you how ****ty this movie is. It is not bad (bad would be probably good in 10-20 years). It is pure, annoying, and insulting ****.1*/10 (0*/10 if i could)"
LukeNSims,Did I really just waste an hour and half watching this?,1/10,14 June 2010,"On occasion people are wrong about how bad a movie is. Not this time.I grew up on Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. I didn't have cable so I would have to sneak over to a friend's house to watch it after school. I did this even though I would be grounded if I was caught sitting inside watching TV rather than running around and getting in trouble like a good kid. It was that good.This movie, however, is not. I put off watching the movie for a few months because I was very hesitant after reading the reviews. But eventually, on a rainy day, my curiosity got the better of me, and I watched Dragon Ball Evolution. Within the first five minutes I had regretted my decision.The acting in this movie is not good at all. It pained me every time somebody spoke. And when the acting was fine (not grand or superb or even good) at some parts, the writing killed it. You could have handed this script to some of the best actors in the world and they still wouldn't have been able to make something good come of it. That's without mentioning that the story itself is horrendous! Even when me and my friends contemplated alternate stories in Dragonball when hanging out in Elementary school we didn't come up with something as terrible as this. I am shocked it was ever approved. It wasn't good enough for the people who had never seen Dragonball and it was so bad that the fans almost wished they had gone blind and deaf to avoid seeing this corruption of an excellent anime/manga.That said, I know that the budget was 100 million dollars. That's a fair bit of money. It was spent in the worst ways possible. They could redo the entire film for the same amount of money with a different script and director, cast, etc and probably come out with a great piece. The Dragonball universe is like Star Wars. Let the vision flow! Do what you can to create new races and effects rather than giving it a half effort like this (see Piccolo).I'm disappointed."
Ertzi,Starts well... but utterly annihilates itself towards the end,6/10,7 August 2009,"Yes, yes I know. Glutton for punishment and all that. But hey, how can I resist a movie that has freaking Spike in it! I was actually mucho surprised at first. This movie is pretty good in the beginning. The actors are practically all unknown, but the music, cinematography and even directing (mostly) are a lot better than one would expect in such a film. The best part is the charming hokeyness that permeates everything, which can't be accidental. Total tongue-in-cheek stuff. I actually laughed a couple of times. I attribute much of this to Stephen Chow, who is one of the producers. I always seem to like what he brings to the table.To my additional surprise, I liked Justin Chatwin quite a lot. He seems to have a sort of LaBeuf-esquire likability. Goofy bugger, but you can't hate him. Two of the supporting actors were simply horrible, though, Chow Yun-Fat among them. Chewed scenery like it was going out of style. The other one everyone guesses when they see him. Jar Jar almost has a competitor now.It always comes down to CGI with these not-made-with-a-huge-budget comic/graphic novel movies. They simply don't have the funds to make it look good. And yet they always cram as much special effects shots in there as they can. Stupid-asses. Although, I have a suspicion that some of the crappy-lookingness was intentional, for comedic effect.Where the film really starts to suck mammoth balls is the last thirty minutes. Oh, boy what a crock of diarrhea. Throwing energy balls and flying is all good and fun for a while (only, not really), but I like my characters to settle their differences via the good ol' mano a mano fisticuffs. Cut the wires and get real fighters for the roles! But with some acting talent at least, mm-kay? So, this rating is basically awarded for the first half of the film, where everything is simpler and more fun. James Marsters is also criminally underused. He is Spike for cryin' out loud!"
bacnekid,Wt a Fantasy :S,4/10,3 December 2009,"i didn't expect much of this one to be honest , and my expectation was right. I wouldn't say it was a waste of time because it actually had this something that made complete it till the end , dunno know why really, but i did any way. If we compared Justin's role in this ""Farce "" and his role in The Invisible u can see a massive difference between the two , i mean wtf !! u're gonna see an absolute different actor ! in other words : the film deformed the actor's image any way i couldn't handle this kinda of "" Fantasy "" or wt ever it's called , there's a lot of holes in the movie that i consider very obvious really ! the director definitely didn't do his best in this one !! * for me , it wasn't that much felicitous :S"
watt_world,Please Never Make Another DragonBall Movie,2/10,25 September 2011,"I really don't even need to review this movie because it was so awful and just know where near the original show. I grew up watching Dragonball as well as DBZ and DBGT and im just afraid to even think of what the director would do if he ever decided to make a sequel. Im all for switching things up a bit but really? Goku goes to high school? They find the dragonballs in 5 minutes? The Oozaru is only 8 feet tall? And i could point out even more FAILS if i wanted to but there's honestly nothing I can put on this review that you already haven't seen on like a million other disappointed fans. Ill be honest this movie is as bad if not just as bad as the Green Lantern that just came out a few months ago. And im not one to judge a movie just by the trailers or even word of mouth, but I think I might have to just go by the trailers from now on and save myself the pain of watching a movie that shouldn't have been made. Also, casting could have been a thousand times better. None of the characters are believable in their roles.

There I was sitting in the movie theater with Goku training with his grandpa and such. Then he is the typical bullied boy in high school... HIGH SCHOOL I tell you. Why would Goku be in a high school? That makes no sense. Oh, and he falls in love with Chi chi. Now I didn't watch Dragonball Z when I was a kid but even I KNEW that it wasn't how that happened. Ugh... I wanted to leave the movie theater so bad because it was just too terrible. From the plot, dialog, script, character casting, and EVERYTHING. Most of the actors don't look like the characters but then again, it was based off an anime so that's understandable. I hated how they portrayed Piccolo in this because he looked so ridiculous. Anyway, even for a non fan like me, I knew that this movie isn't exactly like the anime and manga. I wasn't even a fan of the anime/manga but even I knew that this is so inaccurate. I regret spending money on this but I didn't wait for the DVD version of this movie. I saw this movie on television back in 2012 and I still couldn't bear to watch it."
Jeice_Cobra,Find The Dragonballs To Destroy This Evil,1/10,11 July 2010,"Before I go any further in saying why I hate this hack job of a live action movie based on an epic anime haven, I had a full detailed review i created a while ago but because it wouldn't fit in this 1000 word limit review posting tool, i had to redo it into what your about to read, so lets begin so i can finish. This film is so bad it should be illegal, the characters look nothing like the anime, most of them are missing such as Tien, Chaotzu, Krillin, Emperor Pilaf, Shuu and more. The setting doesn't resemble the areas of the anime and neither does the atmosphere or credibility of this great heaven. The graphics are pathetic and a waste of cgi, the kamehameha wave is shallow and laughable, it looks like a modified plasma ball novelty lamps you get in catalogues for yemma's sake, this is the holding back version. I hate this film and I'm not the only one on here as I have seen the desperate cries of disappointment on the forum board, Akira Toriyama should be ashamed of himself for selling out, and James Wong deserves to be tied to a chair and forced to watch every episode and movie of Dragonball, Dragonball z And GT, to show what live action movie his ""Project"" was supposed to be based on instead of his parody, which DBE clearly was, is & will ever be.I have never seen this film apart from trailers and hearsay of reviews and forum rages, Please be like me and resist paying the 6 pounds or 8 dollars you have to pay to see this joke, parody, whatever people are calling this, you will regret it and be enraged every time you hear this movie.Don't Go And See It.Well this is my review, for the full detailed uncensored no holds bar review that i couldn't fit on here message me via this review.Also Nuruto is the mentally challenged distant cousin of Dragonball Franchise, my review my opinion.."
jcottle-76670,I wish I could give this movie a 0 out of 10.,1/10,24 March 2021,"It's that bad. Dragon Ball had been around for more than two decades and was well established as a franchise worldwide and -this- is the garbage that was produced. Everyone involved should be ashamed.

ChodaTheDread,Just to say something to freaks that made this movie and kill my brain,1/10,8 April 2009,"OK for first thing i must say English is not my mother language so i will have some errors in my writhing but you will all be able to read it......I will just say some facts that make this movie bad: 1.Goku: he is dumb... he don't have High school classes and stuff and he is the one who killed Gohan on full moon when he become Oozaru(not Piccolo) and he don't even have a tail(how he can become Oozaru ???)and he don't need to w8 eclipse for that only full moon....o yea i forgot to tell Oozaru is a 20 m tall gorilla not a 1.8 m tall monkey.....he have his staff..OK good but hi didn't use it once O_o it is magic staff that Gohan give to him with 4 star DB....he train his Kamehameha with lighting candles O_o is that....i could write more and more but i need to say things about others to....2.Master Roshi: did you see picture of that old man he is bald with long beard and mustache and old!!!!!!!

badboypjm666,Who do I see about getting this 1hr25minutes of my life back?,2/10,12 June 2010,"When I first heard about this movie I was very skeptical about how it would turn out. I am a big fan of the original dragonball cartoon series and I didn't think for a second that the movie would be as good.When I first saw the movie, I almost cried. I didn't expect it to be great but I was not prepared for the crapfest that it was. The acting was average and the special effects were OK (not great, but OK). My main problem was the story. I won't include any spoilers but I will say that there was no need for them to change so many things.To sum up, a classic and brilliant story was taken and absolutely butchered. If your a fan of the original series then please stay well away from this movie as you will just be disappointed like I was. I just pray that the sequel gets cancelled.

MonsieurGrenuille,Inadequate,1/10,30 November 2021,"This movie does not do justice to the anime and neither to the manga. James Wang directed this? Production must have used him as bait for the audience. Pieces of the original story are put together and thrown to the spectators that has to put them together and recompose the picture. Lame dialogues, acting and CGI. Watch something else.

bloodwiredautomaton,Uwe Boll > James Wong,1/10,30 March 2011,"Not even Boll himself could have produced a worse adaptation of a beloved franchise. I'm flabbergasted its rating is as high as it is. Even the 'Super Mario Bros' movie was more endearing in its remarkable stupidity and laughably liberal use of characters. I don't even have fun mocking this film, that's how terrible it is. It's not worth examining to see where it failed, and it's not worth my typing this out. Manos: The Hands of Fate is a masterpiece in comparison. It makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock, Pierre Kirby like Shwarzenegger and Shwarzenegger like Humphrey Bogart.Don't watch it. Don't. Don't do it. It's the 'Jekyll and Hyde' game of the film industry.

animefan506,butchered,2/10,17 April 2011,"i love all the dradonballz series, but this was a total butcher of the cartoon anime. i would of thought they would be smarter then that, goku should have been a 12 year old kid or something around that age. they could have made him right, innocent and strong or they could have least made him a super saiyan! idk... piccolo didn't look right, they should have made ALL of bulma's hair blue and made master roshi's house on an island, and they didn't even make shenron green! i would think that they would have been clever to not copy the dragon ball series and start at the ending of dragon ball gt where they left of...so no one could tell of their mistakes. i also thought that everything looked to fake, so i do advise that if you love dragonball anime you probably wont think this is better. if i am wrong then it is because i only saw this movie once when it first came out and forgot a few things, but a fan doesn't forget....

mrwaffle-54-324214,Freakin' awful,1/10,14 May 2011,"its a disgrace it doesn't understand the premise of dragon ball whoever wrote it clearly didn't read or watch dragon ball literally an abortion of a film if u enjoyed it your wrong.Goku doesn't like fighting what is up with this film!!unfortunately not even spike could save this film if your considering watching this just go watch the program i was angry watching this film i sat shaking with fury never watchlet's pray there's never a sequel never watch ever the following would be better: history channel, reading, exercise, music, the internet, literally anything"
josh_moorcroft,"If you love it, then leave it alone!",1/10,5 July 2010,"This film i am especially angry off, simply because I'm a huge fan of dragonball, and this film is an awful representation of the cartoon. First of all, Dragonball is not a kids cartoon, its very funny, very exiting and definitely the best cartoon ever, and thats not even Dragonball Z. Now being a fan of Dragonaball, i was very exited about this film and was eagerly anticipating the release of this film thinking that it would be of the same calibre of, say, the Transformers movie, which was surprisingly very good. But i was extremely disappointed not only of the poor quality of the film, or the terrible acting in this film but the many many plot holes in the film which don't make sense compared to the program. For example; grampa gohan dies when goku is really young, which by the way is near the age of goku when he first meets bulma (who has blue hair), master roshi doesn't look anything like he does in the film or live where he does, the kamehame wave is always blue, piccolo doesn't look like that, ookazi isn't piccolo's side kick, or is part of goku ready to be awakened within him and my god, they are not only not so pathetically weak as they are in the film but there characters are nothing, NOTHING like the film! i could go on for days, but, thats not the point of this review, the point is that this live action dragonball movie, is so pathetically awful, terribly written and acted, that it actually makes Dragonball look a hell of a lot worse which isn't fair, because its a cracking cartoon."
lyynn,Bad,2/10,29 June 2010,"I knew it would be bad so I didn't have any expectations, you could say I watched it just for the heck of it...and I still regret it so much. Dear God, it was like watching Power Rangers shooting magic! Everything was bad: the acting was bad, the special effects were bad, the storyline was bad, for goodness sake, it was so bad I couldn't even laugh at it! Even if you try to watch it as completely unrelated to the manga/anime, it's still utter crap.I realize that recreating a story from 80s isn't easy but I just can't understand why they had to make it even more corny...and if you're trying to make it more realistic, you should stick to it to the end.

idoitonwheels,A true evolution of dragonball,9/10,7 March 2010,"Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of the original series and the characters. When I saw Evolution I identified with it a lot more. It has a perfect ballance of fantasy and realism and really makes the characters more real and relatible. Yes it is different from the series in a lot of ways but that doesn't You need to accept Evolution for what it really is which is not a straight up adaptation.The movie is filled with great special effects (especially considering the 30 million budget), interesting characters and story and really has some good lessons to teach. The acting may not have been the greatest but I wouldn't call it bad. The story well different does bring the characters to life and does a really good job of bringing you something new yet familiar. My only true problem with the film was that the end fight was too short but once again they did what they could with the budget and it really felt like the source material.For those true fans of the series or just anyone looking for a good fun and adventure film I highly recommend Dragonball Evolution."
ptgieseking,OMG. This isn´t Dragon ball nowhere. Just the Title!,1/10,7 December 2019,"I would like to ask if the people responsible for this movie, ever, watched one episode of Dragon Ball before doing the movie?!I would advise to change the name to something else, because it has absolutely nothing to do with Dragon ball. A disrespect to this great Anime.It would be better that someone from marvels movies, Heroes series, etc, do it.Best regards,Philipp Gieseking

womzee,Dragonball Evolution Review,10/10,14 March 2009,"This is a Great movie!! People have to remember that this is an adaptation of the original. They called Dragonball Evolution because it is an advanced version of Dragonball. People say that Goku's saiyan heritage wasn't explained well in the film, which is why they will explain it in the sequels. Many fans say that the movie is nothing like the manga and anime. The similarities are painfully obvious, and there are many similarities(I'm not going to list them, but their are a lot). Many fans did not like this movie because of the same reasons. Goku is in High school, The story is different, the characters look different, etc. It's always the same thing. All you guys have to stop complaining. Change is necessary for a good adaptation. For example, the X-men movies, the Spiderman movies, Batman movies, Ironman, and Transformers were all different from their original versions, and look how they turned out!In conclusion, this is one hell of a movie! I Recommend it to Action fans, sci-fi fans , fantasy fans, or anyone who just wants to watch a fun and exiting movie!"
CucFlavius,Incredible,4/10,18 March 2009,"Truth is, i'm a big fan of combat movies with tons of vfx. I agree with all the other comments, the ones who created this movie haven't watched enough episodes. The storyline and everything is messed up, nothing relates to the original anime series. It's like making a movie after a movie but all you watched is the trailer. This movie is not made for the fans of the Dbz anime series, even tho the creators probably thought they were making it so. The least they could do is keep to the original story-line, not just take the characters and make your own story (wich is worse). Even i would have come up with a better DragonBall movie than this.

Proxish,Just why?,1/10,16 October 2010,". Dear Dragonball Evolution. Why did Goku charge when using the Kamehameha? Why wasn't a massive crater were the blast left? Why didn't the Dragon speak when the wish was about to be made? Why was Goku in high-school? Gohan went to high-school, not Goku. Why did Goku act like he was in pain when he fell against a wall? Why was Goku so slow? Why did Goku turn into an Ōzaru at an Eclipse? And without a tail? He can only turn into an Ōzaru if he has a tail or if he is in Super Sayian 4. Why was Piccolo lying in bed being attended by a Human? When he can regenerate a limb in a minute. Why did he refer to Goku as a Human? Why was he dancing to use the Kamehameha? Why did a Kamehameha restore life to Goku? Why was he almost killed with one gun shot? When he was killing dinosaurs when he was a kid. Why did you call it Dragonball when in Dragonball he is a kid? Why did you not make Bulma's hair completely blue? Why has your director, sponsors, entire crew and cast not been killed yet?

azuredrak,A total disaster,1/10,14 December 2011,"One thing about doing a live adaptation of a Japanese series is that the contents tied to the original series is often removed, and traded for changes that would hopefully strike a balance in appealing to the various different markets.This was where Dragonball : Evolution totally failed.Not only did the movie lose its fans of the original series through the various changes made, it also failed to impress those who are new to the DragonBall name.Dragonball : Evolution could be said to have no connection to the original DragonBall series at all, except for the character's design and name.In this case, the title ""DragonBall"" is merely used as a advertising tool, with non of the good points taken from the original series.If you are a DragonBall fan, you would be disappointed.If you are not one, you would hardly be entertained.This movie failed to show seriousness, but couldn't provide the laughs one would have expected even when taken as a comedic film.A prime example of a production train wreck that failed to live up to its name."

sinaku,"I watched this movie, intending to hate it, and was surprised",6/10,1 September 2009,"I'm not going to say that Dragonball: Evolution is a great movie. Far from it. I haven't really enjoyed anything Dragonball since before Dragonball Z and its 10-episode fights and ****-measuring contests in the form of ""power levels."" But I always enjoyed Dragonball, the original creation of Akira Toriyama. It's ludicrous, but in a genuinely funny way, and despite the standard evil-doer-wants-to-rule/destroy-the-world motif, it manages to stay light-hearted and fun.Where this movie surprised me was how faithful it actually was to the story it's based on. Sure, characters are missing (it's only a movie after all, limited in time,) the Nimbus and Goku's rod are gone, but the characters remained fairly faithful to the original concepts, the basis of the story is here, and the settings are great. We get not only the populated areas but also the sparse wilderness and badlands the show/comic is known for. Piccolo's green, we get to see some Saiyan ape Goku action...honestly I don't know why actual fans of the original Dragonball complained so much.All in all, it's not great, but it's watchable, and fans of the original Dragonball should enjoy this as long as they keep expectations reasonable."
spirous-29040,It hurt me :(,2/10,4 June 2018,"At first we were smiling politely. Should have been a big movie, so the initial impressions must be wrong... Then you think the acting is poor or weird, then you notice the dialouge is terrible. And in the end, the script? And the effects? Wow, this is really a terrible terrible movie. And I am a positive guy. :(

Maybe it's because I'm easily pleased when it comes to films, overall it was, interesting and really entertaining to watch. I think if the film was made to win the hearts of the viewers they would've went above and beyond with the affects and all.

Maya1346,Lol!! Was that a joke??,1/10,30 January 2021,"Omg! this movie was soo bad! It was THAT awful that I laughed the whole time (in a bad way!). Nothing and absolutely nothing made sense: from the plot to the characters and more. The only thing that stuck with the original are the names of the characters and the movie, the presence of the 'dragon balls' and the fact that Piccolo was green. That's about it. The rest was pure ""rubbish"". The CGI was horrendous, Bulma with just a blue strip on her hair?? Really? I'm not even gonna talk about Yamcha cuz he's the worst lol. And why Goku was a teenager? And what's up with his personality?? He's wayy too serious and skinny to be Goku lol. Not even close lol. And don't let me start with Goku's pants with the original orange suit lol those were just awful lol. Didn't really understand how do they managed to go from a city place to a desert to a vulcano lava place to a desert again, to a temple place and so on. The setting was so confusing and there were some characters that didn't really make sense to be there for me. For example Yamcha, how did he actually connect with the rest of the group?? Why did he stuck with the group till the end? Same thing with Bulma. I get that in the anime those are pretty much important but you need to give them a solid reason/plot to be more involved with the whole plot so that it would make more sense. And the way they talked omg lol was like hearing english cartoon characters for little kids lol. So bad. Also what's with this airbender technique?? Is this Dragon Ball or Avatar?? And the plot was too rush hahaha basically Goku said hi and how u doing to Chichi and the next scene they kiss?? Really?? I feel like I missed part of the movie. I'm gonna stop here otherwise I could go on for hours!Don't waste your time watching this movie, unless you would like to have a laugh with your friends at how bad this movie is. In that case you would enjoy a lot!"
cainas80,Surprisingly better than i thought.,5/10,24 March 2009,"Surprisingly better than i thought it would be is the new Dragon ball movie. As i was a big skeptic i really doubted it could be done. As a massive fan of the anime i new that a live action adaptation would never be as good, But if you look at it as an updated twist in a classic it can be an entertaining watch. Chow Yun-Fat plays Turtle Hermit Master Roshi with out taking to much away from the well loved anime version. Since I have watched all the anime, and as most if not all who see this movie would know Our hero Goku, I was really not sure how Justin would play role. After all its GOKU! in the anime we meat Goku as a 12 year old boy, though Justin's Obviously not that young. Justin Plays an 18 year old version of our Hero who is still living with Grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim) He goes to school where he is Picked on (cause Grandpa wont let him fight) by the Boy friend of Chi Chi (Goku's dream girl) played by Jamie Chung. With out giving the story away we can say that there's chemistry between Goku and Chi Chi. What would Dragon ball be without Goku's Arch Nemesis the Lord Piccolo who is in search of the dragon balls to make his wish of vengeance and destroy the Earth, Goku must find the 7 dragon balls with the help of Bulma who has a Dragon ball radar. All in all I would have to say if You are a Die Hard fan of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, and Dragon Ball GT You will watch it even if you think it will be a flop cause no fan would want to miss a live action KA-ME-HA-ME-HAAAAAAA. for those who have never seen Dragon ball Z. It can still be enjoyed as a superhero movie."
Calvincjr91,My Least favourite Movie Ever,1/10,18 December 2012,"I grew up with Dragonball Z and even that didn't raise my expectations for this movie but my god i didn't think you could screw up Dragonball so hardif anyone has ever seen Spoonys Ultima 9 review they would know exactly how i feel i even set up my own betrayal counter and you know what every time i've re-watched certain scenes it's gone upfirst off there's the moronic title which is further proof that just sticking a generic word like evolution on the end of a well known franchise doesn't make the movie sound epicsecond there is the stupid storyline which bears little to no understanding of the original source material and on a large levelthe cast is also a major issue most of these re good actors in other work Justin Chatwin is very good as Steve in shameless but here he makes a terrible Goku who's is the biggest Character betrayal of all not looking remotely Japanese (and before anyone say thats because he's a Saiyan thats no excuse because at this point in the story that they have poorly tried to do Goku was believed to be a human from Japan) and apart from that he has no tail which means there's no explanation for how he turns into a giant ape later in the film and he doesn't have the naivety of the original charter plus sending him to high school that was for Gohan in a later series you numb nuts what were you thinkingEmmy Rossum's Bulma hair isn't blue, Chow Yun Fat's Roshi isn't an old man despite the fact the makeup in pirates of the Caribbean 3 made him look like that and piccolo's make up is completely wrong and is nowhere near as effective a villain as in the Anime and waste of actor James Marstersbut the biggest problem of all is the fact there is no Krillan which provided half the motivations for Goku throughout the entire series which don't look good well for the unfortunately confirmed sequelin short i haven't even begun to state my issues with this movie from crap story to crap effects and just plain lack of effortit honestly felt like a younger me was being punched repeatedly just avoid at all costs especially if you are a dragonball fan because this film might as well have killed the franchised for all the good it did"
glazegabe,"""One Big, Disrespectful Mess""",1/10,5 December 2022,"OH. MY. GOD. This movie sometimes looks like it was made terrible on purpose. They get practically everything wrong about Dragon Ball, including but not limited to:1. Goku being a horny high schooler instead of a naïve 12-year-old boy that didn't know what a girl is.2. Namekians invading Earth and attempting to destroy it, when Namekians in the original manga/anime were pacifists.3. Piccolo killing Grandpa Gohan, when Gohan was actually killed by Goku accidentally.4. Bulma having one strand of blue hair, when Bulma in the anime is known for her blue hair. This isn't true in the manga, however, in which her hair is purple.5. Bulma wanting to wish for fame and fortune instead of either the perfect boyfriend or an unlimited supply of strawberries.6. Paozu being the city where Roshi lives and not the mountain where Goku lives. In fact, a major part of Roshi's character is that he's a hermit, so his living in a city is entirely out of character. Roshi also never lived on Mt Paozu; he always lived at Kame House, which is on an island.7. Roshi appearing middle-aged and not over 300 years old.8. The very presence of airbending in the Dragon Ball universe.9. Mai working for Demon King Piccolo instead of Emperor Pilaf.10. Mai being able to shapeshift instead of just being a normal human.11. The kamehameha bringing Goku back to life instead of being a purely offensive technique.12. Transforming into the Great Ape/Ozaru requiring no tail.13. A solar eclipse triggering the Ozaru transformation instead of exposure to blutz waves, typically from a full moon.14. Turning into the Ozaru not ripping Goku's clothes. Only Saiyan armor can stretch to fit a Great Ape, and that's because Saiyan armor is designed to do that.15. The Ozaru being way too small.16. The Ozaru working for Piccolo, when a Saiyan's Ozaru is 1) not a separate character from the Saiyan's humanoid form and 2) not connected to Piccolo in any way whatsoever.17. Goku/Ozaru killing Roshi instead of Roshi killing himself during the fight against DKP.18. Goku flying towards Piccolo while using the kamehameha instead of the kamehameha knocking Goku back.19. Summoning Shenron requiring a complicated ritual instead of just shouting his name.20. Several notable characters, most notably Krillin, being absent.And those are just the tip of the iceberg. The worst part is, not only is the movie extremely unfaithful to the source material, but it's also horrible in every other meaningful regard. The acting is awful. The CGI is atrocious. The fight choreography is abysmal. The world-building is nonexistent. I'll never forget watching NostalgiaCritic, MasakoX, and LittleKuriboh all rapidly lose their faith in humanity just by reviewing this film. LittleKuriboh called this ""one big, disrespectful mess."" I couldn't agree more."

seawasp,Purists will hate it... but it has the SPIRIT right.,9/10,15 April 2009,"Many of the trailers made me wonder about this movie. Wonder a great deal. But... to my great surprise and gratification, THEY GOT IT RIGHT! For those who are Dragonball/DBZ fans, the best way to describe this is: it's like one of the movies. It's an alternate continuity, one that won't fit with any of the original... but it's got the SPIRIT.One of the brilliant strokes of genius, or utter stupidity depending on how you look at it, is that the original trailers *deliberately mislead* you. There are deceptive cuts and a few actual outright changes of dialogue which make you think one thing when another is true -- and the ""other"" is much BETTER than you expected. They successfully managed to hide a lot of the Real Dragonball Stuff from us until the premiere, which is a hell of a job -- maybe a stupid move, maybe not. It kept a lot of the movie UNSPOILERED for me to watch, which most previews don't.Spoilers follow: The essence of Dragonball was preserved. It takes place on a version of Dragonworld -- it may be called Earth (""Chikyuu"" in Japanese), but it's Dragonworld. We have Capsules, and bizarre technology, weird mixes of cultures... it LOOKS like a Toriyama world, made real.As I rather expected, they fused Gohan and Goku in terms of personality. This actually works well in that it allows us to introduce Goku in an at least somewhat familiar setting.(Worries about him being a loser being beaten up... no, he's not. He has been made fun of, but it's not because he CAN'T fight...) Chatwin, I'm happy to say, does this version of Goku well. He gets the innocence and awkwardness of the Gohan aspects, and when the time comes to be more ""Goku"", he shows it perfectly. Okay, his hair isn't nine inches high, but it's spiky in a very Saiyajin way.Rossum *IS* Bulma. Yes, they've given her some action sequences, but I think that improves her character in context.Chow Yun Fat was, as I said earlier, the RIGHT choice for Mutenroshi/Kamesenin. They toned down his Ecchi nature, leaving just enough of the dirty old man to keep him the same somewhat, er, earthy character.James Marsters was, in fact, the PERFECT Piccolo. He sounded like Piccolo, he moved like Piccolo, and yes, he was very much GREEN like Piccolo Daimao.The changes in plot line... mostly work very well. It is, as others have said, fairly short; I hope there's more on the DVD release.And the final battle IS Dragonball, right down to the final KA...ME...HA...ME...HAAAAA! Oh, and one of the lies told in the previews? The mystics who banded together did NOT create the Dragonballs. They invented the Maa Fubaaa, a technique an awful lot of DB fans forget about, to capture and imprison Piccolo. The Dragonballs are, in fact, what they were always supposed to be, and the Great Dragon Shen-Long DOES make an appearance.The main wrong note for me was Yamucha. Joon Park wasn't the right choice for the character, and he wasn't given any real chance to do much with the character.So in short, I strongly encourage anyone who likes DB/DBZ, or anyone who'd enjoy a quirky super-martial-arts movie, to go see this one. Hopefully there will be a longer version out on DVD soon."
cirenosa,Power Rangers meets live action anime,6/10,19 February 2022,"Any movie that can draw the attention of a house full of young boys deserves at least a 6 ⭐ IMO. Don't expect anything more than that. Don't discount until you've done at least that.

xavierjajo,Greatest insult to Japanese culture since Hiroshima. This movie is the epitome of awful.,1/10,6 July 2017,"It is a complete disgrace, It is a steaming pile. I'm ashamed to introduce this movie to my friends who haven't watch the original series. How dare the director make our childhood series become a twilight. I'm so insulted by this, even the original DBZ creator was so angered he started making DBS which is not as good as DBZ but its still worth watching compared to 'dragon ball evolution'. I have a better name for this movie, I'll call it ""Disgraceful balls of Emostuff"". This is my 1st time writing a review, which I don't ever do other than rate movies but this movie angered me to the point I can't take it anymore that's why I'm writing this review. I got news, they even made some merchandise to milk out more money as if this movie isn't bad enough.

pratikgreat,what's wrong with you guys,8/10,23 August 2009,"Hey folks, 3.3/10 is definitely not what this movie deserves. What do you wish to see in an adaptation of anime or comics on big screen? Just the characters coming to life? That is the case with watchmen and i can see how highly it scores credited to the 2 and half hour long frustrating plot all the while sticking to the source material. Dragonball evolution was discarded by fans because they can't get over a notion that a live adaptation of the best anime ever is impossible. It certainly isn't dark and wily as the dark knight. Rather the movie focuses on high paced action sequence with humor that was the flavor of the anime. Where the movie loses is its very short runtime, average cinematography, and a short and average end fight sequence, when the first few action scenes seemed so promising. Chatwin does a fair portrayal of the cheesy, innocent hero Goku (when was it said he is Asian anyway in the anime?). And about that whole goku going to school thing, doesn't gohan go to school later in the anime? So what's the harm in making some improvisations, otherwise what would be the point of watching something that you know everything about. Roshi's character is just as colorful as in the anime. With some better cgi effects, the movie could really have been awesome. Give it a try with an open mind and without any notions, guys."
abed-sarsur,This is terrible!!!,1/10,28 September 2013,"I am a fan of Dragon Ball, and the is the worst thing I have seen in my whole life, how could he, how? This is not even Dragon Ball, no actor looks even a bit like the real Dragon Ball cartoon characters, no goku no bulma no piccolo no Mr roshi, this is fooool! Even the the fighting is nothing more than a little feminine kids trying to fight, and worst of all there are guns, oh my goodness. I am going crazy, and what, the f***in SUPER SAIYAN GOKU is bullied by earthlings, and who this actor taking Goku's role think he is, just give me one ***** reason why would this be goku? what a mockery, this is not dragonball story in any way, and if who did this is planning on another movie, he better not. Just if we meet ****** *****er. One last word, if you think you can't bring a fighting scene just like in the real Dragon Ball, I say you stay at home, don't think that because you added a good effects, this is dragonball, no no no. Thanks whoever reading this (:

alishahagey,Come on and be fair,5/10,10 April 2009,"OBVIOUSLY this is not going to be high quality film. I grew up with the cartoons and loved them (I admit I have not read the manga). Now, go into the film expecting to see a live action cartoon and you will come out fulfilling all of your expectations.But give an unreal ideal that everything you imagined and everything the story had piece by piece will be identical in the film, and you are kidding yourself of the reality of mixing media. It is not the same and cannot be nor should it.This film was made for a teen/very young adult audience (although my children enjoyed it). It was made friendly for families. They could have exploited the sex angle, and they didn't. Bravo for that.It is fine. It was entertaining. It was stupid. It was a movie based off of a cartoon ... really, they had to make changes to fit the needs. Don't go in expecting everything to be the same as you remember it from childhood (or perhaps for some of you, not so long ago), and you will be pleasantly surprised. Again, remember its FAMILY FRIENDLY. It is just like I said earlier, a live action cartoon with about as much depth."
bsolmon89,Parts a little Corny but it's not as bad as others,8/10,1 April 2009,"Okay first of all, I have to say that for thee $45million budget, they did a great job on the Special effects.Now as far as the cast, I personally think that Justin Chatwin was perfect. I looked on some sites and it seems that some people were saying that either Sean Faris or tom welling should play Goku. Sean Faris? Really? I don't think so. Now Tom Welling could very well do it however I think the hair would look out of place a bit and looking at him, he seem limber enough to do all the things that Goku is supposed to be able to do and yet he does have a strong-looking physique. Welling, doesn't seem to limber. Those are the 2 that I have found to actually look like Goku also.Some people are really mad at the fact that only a couple members of the cast are Asian. Well, as far as Goku, read the above paragraph. I haven't found anyone who is Asian that seemed to look like him. Send me a message of someone if you do. I think that it was more important to have the main character look the main character then trying to find someone who is Asian who doesn't. Chi-chi is think is perfect. Bulma, not so much. I think they could have found someone better for her. They could have gotten someone who would die their hair.Okay it's getting long now, Overall, I like this movie. There are some points where it get's pretty corny but what remake of a cartoon isn't at least a smidge corny. I think that if you never watched an episode of the show, you would enjoy it. I have seen about 2 episodes. That may be the reason why I like it. IF you watched it everyday as a kid, then you probably have something to say that you hate about it."
mark-us_teixeira,WHAT the hell is this????,1/10,2 August 2009,"This movie was so bad. It's not just the fact that it didn't resemble the manga or anime or anyway that made it bad, it was also very poorly constructed. So many plot holes, terrible acting, terrible fight choreography, poor character development, mediocre special effects, and a very short final battle...Who the hell are they marketing this to anyway? They've taken out the stuff that makes it good and different and replaced it with cliché lines. The main character, Goku, who is supposed to be AN ALIEN (therefore with a personality totally different from the humans), now he is a stupid overrated emo teen who only knows to think on girls...lol.. what kind of hero is that??? this no longer have the martial arts/sci-fi/fantasy as main thematics.. now Dragon Ball is a pure teen romantic movie.Because its an adaptation film from the popular anime\manga created by Toryiama, a few changes were expected, but that doesn't mean it should be so butchered from its source material (why call it DragonBall then??). I don't mind a different story or an alternate timeline. But its when you make a movie that is so removed from its source material, its not even recognizable anymore. The only thing they had for source material was names and the dragonballs itself, nothing else. It was a cash-in pure and simple (taking an advantage to the popular title), there was no effort on this movie at all, its a complete garbage.What it is ""killing"" me is the fact that James Wong and Co. are introducing the wrong Dragonball story to the world and with a new story that will put the fans in shock and the non-fans will think we fans are crazy by loving such franchise... DB do not deserve something like that.. it was an awesome show turned into a mockery!!"
lordpoee,Did Wong even watch the series?,1/10,26 June 2009,"First I'd like to say: I enjoyed Space: Above and Beyond and it is probably James Wong's defining work.Now that that has been said. This movie is just awful! So many elements of the series have been changed, Justin Chatwin as Goku? What a HORRIBLE choice! At no time did he strike me as ""Goku"". The ONLY actor in this movie that made an attempt to portray the characteristics of their anime counter part was Chow Yun-Fat, who was at times comical and bizarre.Where are Piccolo's antennae? Goku's tail? The Saiyan mythology is COMPLETELY absent from this movie!! The back story completely re-written. Sure, GOKU transforms into ""Oozaru"" a 7-9 foot tall, angry ape. Seriously! In the series the ape is HUGE and transforms in the full moon NOT a solar eclipse as is shown in the movie.I hope the second movie completely abandons the first, with all new casting and a return to the original vision."
mitchellkerr,Brilliant,8/10,28 May 2011,"I saw a trailer of this film and i thought it looked brilliant, and when i watched it it was brilliant, it was full of action from start to end and i think the actors portrayed the characters very well. If anyone says this film is crap they have no sense. I don't see why people have to be so picky with how the characters look, This is supposed to be a bit different and it is and it does it well. I also thought the special effects were awesome. It really is a great adaptation of the manga series. I can't wait for the sequel to this film. It will be brilliant. My mum also enjoyed the film as much as i did. Some people can be hard to please.

Kalin-Thalis,It's 'okay' for what it is....,4/10,9 September 2009,"Okay, this is not a good adaption, but I think that's not really what they were attempting here... The fact of the matter is dragonball and dragonball z knew how to combine comedy and hard action keeping in the fantasy without losing its credibility. Now it's a hard task to imitate that, cause in my opinion dragonaball GT didn't succeed in that, but that's my opinion. So a live-action film doing that is even more difficult. People always said the earlier adaption of dragonball was more like a comedy rather than an action film with comedy elements, cause they couldn't keep it realistic cause they copied too much from the manga itself.To have a live-action movie with a credibility to it, a realism with some comedy elements that embodies Dragonball completely is imo almost impossible. They attempted to make their own realistic version. In a way they succeeded, though they went too far changing things that this just didn't feel like dragonball anymore, but a bad copy. Changing plots in the story of dragonball will cause heavy criticism, that was to be expected.They tried to create a version of Goku that was more realistic so they dropped the OTT spikey haircut. That was not a bad idea. Justin Chatwin delivered as a mediocre actor, but with a responsibility to play a version of Goku who was so much changed from the original, it was just bound to fail. Imo opinion it wasn't a bad idea to first change the haircut and his age. Keeping the same age he had in the first dragonball would have caused a Star Wars prequel effect as star wars fans in general hold a pretty strong hatred for starting the prequels with the main character Anakin as a young boy. This film would have had a more negative impact and strike off as a film that was meant for younger audiences, while this film was meant for all audiences.As bloody as an anime can be, to put that in an live-action film would have demanded a stronger rating and as it was meant for all audiences it's clear they wanted to avoid that. To make it more bloody would probably have satisfied dragonball fans more, but in the end to demand that would have been selfish. So less blood so a larger audience can see it, is acceptable for me.The problem with the script is many. Change of plot as stated before, change of characters. I personally thought it was a bad idea to change Gohan's death. The tragedy (or the irony) that Gohan was killed by Goku himself was important and to change that was a very bad idea. To change the idea how Goku transforms into an Oozaru was again not good. And yeah how the Oozaru was depicted was first of all not very loyal since they are much larger and it wasn't very credible to see since the FX weren't fantastic. That always something terrible happens during an eclipse is very cliché and just makes the plot more unoriginal.In the end I thought this film was mildly entertaining, but does it satisfy me as a dragonball fan? Certainly not... Do I think it's an insult to the original manga. I don't care. This film is so far off the manga that I can hardly connect the two. Same name same characters, but that's about it. So for what it is it's not a disaster, but it's not a great movie. Try not to expect the worst as I did and you'll find yourself at least entertained. Expect too much and you'll hate the movie."
MagusYanam,Thoughts on DBE,6/10,10 April 2009,"The budget was fairly obviously low and the plot had a number of dragon-ball-sized holes in it. In short, it was an enjoyably bad action flick, on about the same level as Corey Yuan's DOA: Dead or Alive. But I wasn't really expecting anything more. It would have been an excellent popcorn movie if it didn't have the label of Dragonball on it.Acting. I thought from the TV spots that Chatwin's Goku looked more like Daniel LaRusso from The Karate Kid, and that hunch turned out to be dead-on, except that Daniel LaRusso's character demonstrably develops and matures, whereas Chatwin's Goku... doesn't. (Not that he has much opportunity.) I could see occasional flashes of Toriyama's Son Goku in Chatwin's character, but that's about it. Likewise, Chow Yun Fat's Kamesen'nin showed occasional flashes of the dirty-old-hermit-in-a-turtle-shell, but not enough to impress. Rossum did well as Bulma, and Joon Park's Yamcha is probably the one bright spot in an otherwise poorly-characterised movie. As for Marsters - this film needz moar of him.Plot. Basically there to get you from one fight scene to the next. Piccolo is evil alien dude, wants to destroy world and is obviously capable of doing so, so WTF is he doing collecting the dragon-balls? Goku/Chichi romance was Twilight-level ridiculous: I'll be honest, I liked Bulma/Yamcha better, but that's saying zip. Cliffhanger at the end has all the dramatic timing and gravitas of Kalgan's awakening at the end of Space Mutiny.Special effects were passable - the best moment being the end fight with Piccolo and the Kamehameha, and I would have appreciated the background attempts to remind us that this was based on the world Toriyama created if it weren't for it being populated by imbeciles.Entertainingly cheesy, but not Dragonball."
Veggeto112,Hollywood hang your head in shame....,1/10,14 July 2009,"As a fan of the Dragonball Universe, from the offset i knew that i would probably not enjoy this movie, but of course i would still have to watch it with an open mind. However, I could not have anticipated just how bad an 'interpretation' of a franchise ""Dragonball Evolution"" is - this is the purest example of how Hollywood can attempt to cash in from franchise success in other countries,especially Asia (at least the ""Ring"" and ""Grudge"" adaptations had some form of similarity to the original media.) There is so much wrong with this film it is ridiculous = On its the own the film falls completely flat, but when compared to its apparent 'source' material it is an absolute disgrace. The actors gave poor, clichéd and unimaginative performances, the SFX for a movie that sorely needs them would not have been impressive 5 years ago and the screen writer quite frankly deserves to be shot. There are so many plot holes and inconsistencies within the franchise it is shameful, you would have thought the director would have some form of consideration for the fans and the series as a whole, or even to attempt to find some cross-over appeal. Even minor missing details make a huge difference to this new line of films which I've heard will apparently have a sequel (?!) - Goku is a teenager, a damn teenager who is BULLIED - He doesn't have a tail, and the word Saijjin / Saiyan wasn't even mentioned once ! - King Piccolo just 'dies', there is no form of birth for the Piccolo we all know in Dragonball Z. -Theere is so little development or detail about the origins of the characters or the universe that i severely pity new viewers. - The list is absolutely endless as to what i could complain about - the absence of Krillin (a main character), the disregard of the image and personality of the characters, cheesy dialogue, Ki blasts made of wind (!!!)...What, if handled properly, could have been a relatively good action flick has become an absolute shambolic mess of a film, damn Hollywood for raping such a unique franchise and Americanising it in a way only Hollywood can..."
gokulooki,If I could it's crap rating between 1 & 10 would be over 9000,1/10,6 March 2014,"Before this film gets absolutely slaughtered I want to tell you something that was good about the film... so when erm... what about when... that time....when she did... ah man there is absolutely nothing good about this filmThere are many questions that can be asked about this film but i'm going to just mention a few, here is the first 1) how could this ever be a terrible film? By today's technology this film could and should have been epic. A 'Kamehameha' would look amazing with today's CGI abilities but no. James Wong had to go and make it look like a technique for pussies rather than the most powerful technique in the world which somehow also has the power to bring someone back to life!! There was more than enough source material, there are 3 Dragonball series equaling to over 500 episodes which means that there is more than enough information to go on to create a worthwhile dragon ball film, heck they even had Akira Toriyama who did so much writing for Dragonball... HE KNOWS THE SERIES INSIDE OUT!! But it was apparently decided that it will ignore absolutely everything that was about the series... Goku goes to high school... Cici fights in martial arts tournaments... master roshi is a young over acting pile of poo... and the worse thing about this film... Goku has next to no muscle and says that he ""promised his grandpa that he wouldn't fight"", I meant that's sweet apart from the fact that THAT WAS THE ENTIRE POINT OF GOKU!!! He loved to fight, it was his thing, he was born from a race of super powered fighters, to say boku doesn't fight is to say that Sauron was made of flowers and puppy dog tears. Makes no sense.2) Why was the monkey named Osaru... and why was there no tail? Now in the series the reason why the Saiyans had a tail was because on a full moon they turned into giant monkeys and destroyed planets, take the tail off and they are able to stay normal and gain super saiyan powers. Again the film decides to make that idea irrelevant, apparently piccolo and Osaru tried taking over the world before anyone can remember which means until this moment when Goku turns into him again there has not been a single full moon. I mean really? not even one? Plus this stupid ape thing that these idiots created doesn't even have a tail, again not at all following the source material3) Why does Goku fly with the 'Kamehameha' and also why does he massage it into existence? First of all I think there should be some copyright infringements between this film and avatar as it enters into the realm of air bending plus it is turned into a concentrated ball of energy which enters the realm of Naruto and Rasengan, if only Bandai and Nickelodeon had found out before the release they could have shut the film down and do us a favor and not get our hopes up only for them to be shat back into our faces. Next we have the fact that Goku must do these weird massaging air motions (which I can imagine he only knows from stroking some guy off making him gay, and to be honest, the film is so inconsistent with the actual anime/manga series that I wouldn't be surprised) instead of just pulling his hands back and saying the prolonged 5 episode span of the word ""Kamehameha"" and afterwards the move isn't a projectile it is in fact just a ball that he must fly with to give it projectile power... sound familiar? oh yeah that's what Naruto does.4) Why was the acting so absolutely abysmal? You would think that they would at least spend time looking for the right cast (i'm going to exclude Emmy Rossum as she is actually a good actress who was amazing on 'Phantom of the Opera') and spend time on the script but they really didn't. Terrible casting, terrible acting, terrible writing and terrible storytelling. There was nothing good or nostalgic - in relation do the dragon ball series - about this this film, the bloody dragon that came out of the damn balls was gold, not even green... and it didn't talk, it was also tiny. It might as well have been a silent golden Mushu, actually I think that's an insult to Mushu, i'm sorry buddy. Oh yeah and where was Krillin? You know Goku's life long bald buddy? Not able to put him in? too much to ask?I could go on but it would require an entire novel to complete... in summary this film was the worst film ever created, the worst adaptation of a anime/cartoon/adaptation in general ever created and the worst acting to ever be in a film. It had the potential to be something great, with so much money and backing from years of various series and films, it could have bought dragon ball to a level of epic that the series could never have imagined... if they had only stuck to the source material. Sadly they ignore absolutely everything that made the series great and as such they deserve to be swallowed by cell never to see the light of day again."

ong1980,Did the director receive death threats?,1/10,9 March 2010,"This movie is a total disrespect of the original Dragonball series. The outrageously inaccurate portrayal of 'OUR' Dragonball is just shocking, it has got nothing to do with the comic and hell they thought it's cool to add crap Hollywood elements into the film which completely destroy the untouchable classic. First of all, none of the actors resemble the characters in the comic a single bit and just when I thought they would create a cool looking piccolo, doesn't necessary have to look completely like the one in the comic but I was in for a rude surprise to see one of the best character in the comic looking worst then ugly duckling, not to mention that his role is literally non existence, same goes to the storyline which again has nothing to do with the comic. Without vegeta, trucks, red ribbons bots...etc was actually the best thing in this movie else the damage done would have been unthinkable and the director might need to look for a temporary hideout.

paok_powers,actually enjoyed it,10/10,20 May 2009,"i'm giving this movie a 10 just to raise the the average vote cause this movie is in no way a 3. i mean sure it's not like the anime but what movie could summarize the whole anime? its simply impossible. still i felt the dragonball vibe all over the movie. it had an interesting storyline with some goofy parts and it was very light. it followed the dragonball history but kept it original. as for the actors. justin chatwin did a good job although a bit different from the original goku. one of the parts i liked more was from bulma i think she nailed the character perfectly. i didn't like master roshi however, they ruined the character. and is it just me or does joon park have the exact voice as yamcha? overall i liked the movie. it's not dragonball, its dragonball evolution and they did just that.

gramermarcel,Are you a grownup?,5/10,14 March 2023,"Going over the reviews for the original DBZ, 2 things stick out.1) DBZ is written to be understood and consumed by 7yo and above. Not a criticism, just an objective observation, factual and verifiable (i.e. Rated TV-Y7). This movie only steps that up to PG.2) The awesome reviews come from nostalgic recollections of the reviewer's childhoods. You know, back when you were only pretty sure Santa wasn't real but just knew you too could one day be a martial arts master and superhero. Scroll through and you'll see they start with- I remember when I was 6, or- Started watching with friends after school, etc.All this to say, a 2 star average accompanied by such hyperbolic vitriol is the type of anomaly rating you get when you hit a nerd nerve, when you dare attempt to modernize stories of yesteryear that were embraced by nerdiest among us (not a criticism, I love nerd lore too;).Every comic book guy will come out of their metaphorical basement to say it's the ""worst ____ ever"".That's understandable, even amusing, but they're frustration is misplaced. Hollywood's attempt to reboot something fun from a then otherwise largely overlooked genre, should be appreciated, not derided. Not like this took away from some other anime movie getting made, as the years before we got the quality we have now have proven.It just wasn't time yet. The biggest mistake this movie made was not predicting the overly precious recollection of their target audiences childhood. That, and also just not trying very hard... Despite all the above, it actually isn't very good😂 It's just not NEARLY as bad as reviews make it out to be.I get it, it's a dumb movie, JUST like all things created for children (kids are great, but they're famously not as smart or able to understand the real world as well as adults), but that doesn't make it bad. It just means manage your expectations and know you're about to watch a 15yo live action reboot of a 30yo cartoon made for kids fascinated by super powers and fighting abilities that let them defeat their bullies in wild spectacles.If what you want is well enough choreographed fights that use unusual methods (like single handedly defeating a handful of attackers and destroying their car without ever touching any of them), and also still appreciate late 2000's CGI (not as great as today's, but passable), then this scratches the itch.If you grew up a diehard DBZ fan and want a movie that takes your childhood fantasies seriously to tell an adult story that adheres to your version of verisimilitude (which was as fuzzy as your understanding of that word at that age), then your nostalgia has set expectations that cannot be met.An adult giving this 1 star and ranting that it's an insult to fans is like complaining that the mall Santa is insulting your childhood memory of Christmas.It's a kids movie, get over yourself."

redninjaboy,So... Frustratingly... BAD...,2/10,3 November 2017,"WARNING. This review contains spoilers for both this movie, and the original Dragon Ball. I will be discussing EVERYTHING I feel needs to be discussed. You have been warned.When I first saw a review of this movie, I was a little confused. Surely, this movie can't be THAT bad, right?It's that bad.The story goes that the evil King Piccolo has escaped his imprisonment and is seeking to the rule the world. General bad guy plot. He's searching for the Dragon Balls, seven amber orbs with red stars in the center that summon the dragon, Shenron, to grant you any one wish. And I'm sad to say that they're the best thing the CGI gives us in this movie. Everything else looks AWFUL. Anyways, he enlists the help of Mai, servant of Emperor Pilaf in the original Dragon Ball show. Except for two things. Mai is a merciless killer in this version, which I honestly don't mind. But Pilaf and Shu, the other servant who's also a dog, are NOWHERE in this movie. Not at her side, not elsewhere looking for the Dragon Balls, not even MENTIONED. Meanwhile, Goku is training with his grandfather, Gohan. Except Gohan is a teenager in this movie. He doesn't become a teenager until the end of the show. After he's defeated King Piccolo. Why is he a teenager now? Because reasons. He also goes to school, which is stupid because Goku in the show cares NOTHING for a formal education. The most he gets are small lessons from his later teacher, Master Roshi. He also has a crush on the obvious girl love trope in this movie, Chi-Chi, who he ALSO cares little for in the show. He likes her, sure, but he likes her about as much as he likes anyone else. He still doesn't really LOVE her when they get married. But in this movie, he apparently has a crush. Anyway, things happen, he goes to a party on his birthday, Piccolo goes to find the Dragon Ball in Gohan's house, realizes it's not there because Goku has it, then destroys the house with Gohan inside. Goku feels that something is wrong and heads back, only to witness Gohan die while telling him a poem that will lead him to the quest for the Dragon Balls. Obviously, this is stupid because it gets rid of the whole point of Goku being responsible and not Piccolo. Enter Bulma, the teen daughter of a scientist, searching for the Dragon Balls to wish for the man of her dreams. ...Sorry, I was thinking of the show. I meant young adult spy searching for the only Dragon Ball she knows exists by threatening Goku with a sci-fi gun. Somehow, her machine doesn't show the others, seeing as they give off the same signal as the one she was searching for. She also has on small streak of blue in her hair, rather than a full head of blue hair. Because fashion? They go on the quest, meet up with Roshi, then begin their quest for the Dragon Balls. I'm gonna skip a lot of this, but I will say that Yamcha's in this movie. He's basically the comic relief of the movie. On one hand, it's Yamcha. Yamcha sucks as a character in general and isn't very cool. In Dragon Ball Z. On the other hand, in DB, he's one of the coolest characters. The writers of this movie probably only watched DBZ and assumed Yamcha's character from that. Anyway, they go through more stuff, fight off crappy computer effects, then meet up with Piccolo after teaching Goku the Kamehameha. A few things wrong with that scene, by the way. Goku learns it because Chi-Chi is teaching him. He's able to do it because he loves her. And they refer to it as Airbending. As if we needed to compare it to that awful movie. Even so, they have NOTHING to do with each other. Anyway, they meet up with Piccolo, who causes their car-ship to crash. Goku somehow changes into his orange clothes in the middle of it, then goes to fight Piccolo. However, a big plot twist is revealed. ""Big"". Goku turns out to be Oozaru, Piccolo's servant who'd been hinted at throughout the movie. He'd been sent to Earth, not in a space pod from Planet Vegeta by the Saiyans, but in a meteor from Piccolo. He states that when the sun is eclipsed by the moon, Goku will transform into the monster. And he does. But there's a few problems with this scene. Goku transforms via the full moon, not a solar eclipse. The Oozaru Goku transforms into is MUCH smaller than the Great Ape from both shows. Oozaru is maybe eight feet tall. The transformation required the Saiyan (not Piccolo servant) to have a tail, which Goku doesn't even HAVE in this movie. Goku transforms back by simply believing. ...That in general is just dumb. And finally, THIS is what should have killed Gohan, not Piccolo searching for a Dragon Ball. Anyway, he overpowers BIOLOGY itself, defeats Piccolo in a crappy blast effects contest, and kills him. They then bring Shenron in and wish for Roshi, who Oozaru had killed, to be brought back. Then the Dragon Balls disperse, prompting Bulma to reveal that they don't turn to stone for a year before they can be used again. They just have to be found again. So the movie ends with a final scene, showing Piccolo Jr as a child, being cared for by some woman, teasing the sequel that'll never happen. I will give the movie this. Aside from Piccolo's makeup being... genuinely decent, if you ignore his lack of antennae, the movie can actually be entertaining to those who know nothing about the show. It's fun to make fun of it, but not if you realize how many things they did wrong to insult the show."
emmiboff,Nope.,1/10,12 December 2019,"This is nothing like dragon ball the series. The only thing that's the same is the names of the characters. This movie is painful to watch and corny in not a good way. I got more and more angry the further into the movie I got. Watch it for free if you want to give it a try but you'll regret it if you pay anything for this crap.

nextgeneration21,Official Dragonball : Evolution Review - Unbiased,10/10,2 April 2009,"""KAMEHAMEHA!"" Dragonball has blasted into theaters going from a legendary anime to a live action phenomena. The story focuses on a young, somewhat naive, boy named Goku ( Justin Chatwin) and his newly acquired friends Bulma (Emmy Rossum), who is a brilliant scientist, and Master Roshi (Chow Yun Fat). The setting of this story is prominent in West City, the Desert, The Shaoilin Temple, and follows with the Dragon Temple. This action packed movies brings the joy and excitement the anime had brought with it.The story begins off with Goku(Chatwin) training with his grandfather, Gohan(Randall Duk Kim). Unlike in the anime, Goku is already exposed to the world around him and attends high school. Goku is some what of an outcast, and eventually gets noticed by his crush, Chichi (Jamie Chung). Goku receives a gift from his grandfather, which is a Dragonball. Gohan is attacked by Mai (Erika Tamura). The fight is interrupted as the evil Lord Piccolo (James Marsters) enters and practically kills Gohan. Goku discovers what happens and goes on a quest to find Master Roshi to warn him that Piccolo has returned. Goku is confronted by Bulma, and they form an alliance. They find Master Roshi and head off into the desert and have a run in with Yamacha (Joon Park). Together they make their way to find the rest of the Dragonballs and eventually have to confront Lord Piccolo.The acting in this film is above average. Im pretty sure that if there was a longer script than the acting could have been better. Chatwin was able to bring out the character of Goku well. Joon Park as Yamacha would seem like an exact copy of Yamacha , as well as Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi. Emmy Rossum as Bulma is near perfection as Bulma. There were certain instances where a few of the characters deviated some, but overall it was a very decent attempt.The whole direction of the movie is fast paced. To be honest this is what may be the only downfall of the movie and may affect it in a very negative way. From hopping into one scene to the next it may get confusing for those who do not know the anime. Along with the fast paced motion of the film, many plot holes appeared. Some examples are ""How did Picollo know of Goku?"" or ""How did Piccolo escape?"". For the sequel it would be best if the pace of the movie was about medium and more in line to that of the anime.Over all the movie is pretty enjoyable. It deviates away from the story of the anime at points, but it is an adaption. With the movie being about 100 minutes and the budget supposedly around 45 million, I say that they accomplished a lot. Dragonball is a good movie and I would recommend people to see it. Bring your kids too since they turned this into more of a family type movie. Dragonball has everything someone looks for in a movie;action, adventure, and comedy."

superchiaotzustar7,Amazing!,10/10,15 March 2009,"This movie is just plain amazing. I will now tell you why. Warning Spoilers!Good Things:The movie opens up with the line: ""First rule, their are no rules"" The first shot is gokus eyes....sweat beating down his face....(with kick ass music in the background) THIS OPENING SCENE KICKS ASS!All the acting is amazingly true to the novel. The effects are unique and masterful. The story remains true to the novel(as much as possible besides high school.) Fast paced.Bad things:Wirework isn't the best ever.(But I personally didn't mind that) Goku (though Justin acted exactly like him.) Wasn't written to well. Oozaru wasn't amazing.but besides those three things the movie just rocked!"
dzimbeck,Evil film stay away from it,1/10,2 January 2015,"Instantly it contradicts itself saying oozaru was around 10,000 years ago but Goku is only in his teens. Then every 5 seconds something new insults the original series. It would be better to have your head burned off or shave your eyes. It would be better to chew off your own arm than to watch this. The movie was obviously a deliberate act of spite. There is no explanation for how cruel this is. The fanboys aren't joking, even if you haven't seen a single episode of Dragonball, this movie is still hellspawn and it also trashes the original series in a obvious deliberate act of spite. Its movies like this that I think hell may be here on earth.The thing is, me and my friends used to watch ""Bad Movies"" for fun. Like ""A dangerous woman"" or ""Neverending Story 3"" or ""Manos the hands of fate... the god of boredom"" lol... and anything that looked really bad. Those movies were a lot of laughs. Dragonball Evolution is worse than watching a 2 month marathon of horror films like ""The Cell"" or ""Hostile"" and ""Schindlers List"" in a row.Why? Because unlike propaganda films, this film had no political motivation other than to smash the dreams of all the people who love the anime so much. Everything was the polar opposite of the manga. Goku wanted to get girls instead of being pure hearted, he went to high school, the dialog was garbage, the film was rushed, the effects were trash. But the story, holy !@$%. I mean, it would have been better to release 2 hours of a blank screen with silence. I would have appreciated that more. Or even just 2 hours of anything but this. Anything about this movie was bad. I am not sure if the soundtrack was bad because watching the film gave me a headache.I remember showing 15 minutes of the film by ""skimming"" to a friend and we both got sick, I almost threw up and we spent the next couple days depressed. This was only to do my civil duty to show what the face of Satan looks like. I actually had unfortunately saw it a second time with another friend because he wanted to know what it was like to spend an hour in hell. Again, we got sick.So this is coming from a guy who loved ""The Room"" and thinks it was a maserpiece of ""Bad Movie Comedy"". But Dragonball on the other hand really is that bad. Its like the movie ""The Ring"" but in real life. This movie in comparison would make Mother Theresa think ""Salo"" was ""Citizen Kane"" after watching this.The only reason I could think anyone would have refused to let Akira participate would be that they deliberately wanted to make the worlds worst movie.Akira Toriyama is such a hero, that he made ""Dragonball Z: Battle of the Gods"" and it was so obvious he made it because he felt that he needed to sooth the broken hearts and souls of people who suffered after GT/Evolution. But even GT is a masterpiece compare to this film.With that said ""Dragonball Z: Battle of the Gods"" was one of the best films ever made in the Dragonball series. And nothing beats the original series of Dragonball. I'm a bigger Dragonball fan than Dragonball Z actually. Anyways, had to end on a positive note. This is the only movie I ever reviewed on IMDb. It can't be said enough. If you see a copy of this in the stores, vandalize it. If you know anyone with a copy, go on to their hard drive and delete it. If you see a copy lying around, throw it in the trash. Hopefully if we all do that, we can eliminate the film from existence."
womzee0,Dbe,10/10,28 March 2009,"Most of the people who rated this movie 1 out of 10, either saw the Bootleg or didn't even see the movie. Don't listen to them. Yes, there right about it being very different. But who wants to see the some old thing, NOT me. The movie was a little rushed, yea, but thats because they want to get the DRAGONBALL story over with, so that they can start with DRAGONBALL Z. This is basically all of the main characters background story, or how they all met. Thats ALL it is. Its like an intro to the sequels.Personally, I thought it was great! Even though it was rushed, it was still a fun, cool, and very entertaining movie!(for your information, its a family movie) This movie is more directed towards young kids, and they will LOVE this movie.

jackwilsoncool,"Before watching, read below.",1/10,25 August 2015,"This film is just a horrible excuse for a fun action flick that happened to have the magnificence of Dragon Ball slapped onto it. I honestly don't think anyone who worked on this movie knew ANYTHING about the Dragon Ball manga or anime. None of the characters in the movie are anything like their actual characters. It also faces other bad problems, like bad acting, cheesy effects, a pointless love interest, and a crappy storyline. Also, the number of fight scenes is unbelievable. For a show that has so many epic fight scenes, you would think this movie would have tons, right? WRONG.This movie has like 3 fight scenes. Really, I counted. But it all comes down to this. If you are a Dragon Ball fan, don't watch this. If your just a normal person looking for a cool action movie, don't watch this.

terminadoru,You'll probably like it if you never seen the anime,1/10,14 April 2009,"I think the movie was both good and bad.I agree that the storyline shouldn't have been changed.I know that it's very extremely long, but the anime has lots of plots that did not affect that much the evolution of the story till the point he fought Piccolo.That part could have been made maybe into the first ten minutes, showing more scenes but with connections between them.Unfortunately there were too many American aspects to a movie adaptation of an anime.I consider that the movie would have done great if we could have seen the cartoon scenes recreated with state of the art visual effects.For those who didn't watch the anime, i can say that it's not a bad movie.The storyline is solid, but don't believe what you see.In the Dragonball universe,things happen differently, better, original...

hazard8726,Stab Out My Eyes,1/10,6 October 2009,"so i just watched ""Dragonball: Evolution""... I'm trying to get the way I felt while watching this movie and I can only describe it as this. Imagine you're watching the worst movie you've ever seen eating popcorn. Then suddenly you realize that you're not eating popcorn, but your firstborn child. As horror sears this image onto your soul, you hear the faint sound of kamehameha and the complete annihilation of anything that was ever entertaining or held sacred by canon. This is a brief glimpse of what it is like to watch this movie. Now imagine you're me, who paid two dollars to experience this, and add the gut-wrenching horror that this 1.5 hrs of your life could've been better spent rubbing lye into your eyes. At least as your eyesight was burned away you would've seen something with a more convincing plot than Dragonball: Evolution.

King-Leoric,"Bad, but not that bad",6/10,17 March 2009,"I watched DBZ growing up, loved it, and knew going in that this movie would not compare, just as a book doesn't generally compare to its movie. If you go in expecting a perfect match to the TV anime series, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a movie that will hold your attention (action, humor...even when scenes aren't suppose to be humorous) then you will enjoy the show. Yes, some of the special effects are on par with Sci/Fi TV movies, but they are definitely good enough to entertain. Not once did I want to get up and leave. Bad: The characters definitely feel a bit shallow (Picollo has like 5 minutes of screen time, total), the length of the movie is too short, the script needs a rewrite. Good: Actors did a pretty good job with what they were given.Also: 25mintues seems to have been cut from the Asian version, that I believe will appear in the US release. I've got my fingers crossed that the added content helps the brutality of some of the comments.Go see the movie, keep your expectations as low as possible, and I think you will enjoy it. If you are a 'hater' going in, you will be a 'hater' coming out. Very few movies deserve a 1 or 2 out of 10, and DBevolution is no exception. Decent movie, ignore the negativity."
ali-007,My thoughts on the movie,1/10,1 June 2010,"I don't know where to even begin explaining how much of an embarrassment this movie is to a classic manga and anime, but I'll start with the things I hated least of all; Goku in high school, letting the stupid kids label him as a geek when he could have ripped them all a new anus without even trying, and getting Chichi to like him; not a wise choice for the plot line, but I suppose some changes to the story need to be made so it doesn't look like a carbon copy of the anime. Also, since Goku was always portrayed as an ""oriental"" character, that would mean he would look Asian.They chose a Caucasian actor for the film, and a lame, weak actor I might add; Justin Chatwin has little or no experience in acting, and should not have been chosen for the role of such a big character. In fact, all of the actors did poorly. Their dialogue was corny, and, like Chatwin's acting, lacked a good sense of drama. They also did a poor job on Goku's hair; it looks like they dumped a glob of hair gel on his head and molded it around. They didn't even bother spiking it up. Then there was Piccolo's design; he looked like The Mask, except with pointy ears, and his outfit looked so ridiculous and derivative; a design that's been seen in Star Trek so many times. Also, Goku has no tail. He needs the tail to be able to transform into the Oozaru. And he transformed at the eclipse; he's supposed to transform at the sight of a full moon. When he embraced the Oozaru within him, it had a repulsive lack of drama. The special effects were clearly on a low budget, and they couldn't even afford to set up fans in the scene so, for example, when someone charges up an energy ball, wind blows all around them to enhance the effect. Krillin's absence doesn't do much good either; how else is Goku able to unlock his super saiyan power without the ""pain of loss""? The worst part of the entire movie was the final battle between Goku and Piccolo. Goku's ""kamehameha"" cry was also very weak and dry, and instead of a beam struggle between Goku and Piccolo, Goku used his beam to fly at Piccolo and punch him out. Let's not forget Shenron's design; he looked like a stubby western dragon; Shenron was always an eastern snake dragon. But there were still some good things; such as when Bulma first introduced the capsules her family invented, and activated the capsule, instead of appearing in an exploding cloud of dust, it transformed into a bike; that was pretty cool. And even though Master Roshi clearly wasn't as old here as he was in the original anime, he still maintained his ""dirty old man"" persona. Unfortunately, those don't change a thing about my opinion on this movie; If James Wong even dares to make a sequel, somebody please call his hit.The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 out of ten is because they got the names right!"

yankeeskins,"It's Dragonball, NOT Dragonball Z !!!!!!!!",6/10,11 April 2009,"First I'll say I was a DBZ and a Dragonball GT fan; not a big fan of Dragonball (i.e young goku). Dragonball was rather infantile. And I'm basing this on what cartoon network showed of the Dragonball series. that being said, i'm getting the feeling that most fans here were expecting to see the action we saw in Dragonball z (saiyans, frieza, cell). Dragonball Evolution matched the juvenility of the Dragonball cartoon series but tries it's best. Honestly, I knew there was no way they could duplicate the action of the DBZ series unless they spent significant dollars which I doubt any production company would do for an anime series which hasn't been on the air for a few years now. Knowing this, I downgraded expectations, and by doing so, the first 30-40 minutes were OK. Goku in highschool and his first fight were entertaining. After that, the movie went down hill:  Poor action scenes coupled with bad acting are a disaster. You can have one or the other but not both  Rushed/semi-inaccurate story line  Few fight scenes, way too few, I mean seriously way too few (I thought Yamcha knew martial arts in Dragonball)  Would have been more entertaining if Piccolo did his own dirty work (action movies are known for their villains as much as the heroes as was the entire dragonball series)  Didn't like the ""action hero"" spin on BulmaThis movie was pretty bad even for a Dragonball level. But I'll admit, if they make a sequel, I will go see it. I think they deserve another shot now that they got the back story out of the way. Here's hoping they get the Dragonball Z version right. I gave this movie 2 extra stars because Jamie Chung was hot."
wilhp8,Waist of a DVD,4/10,31 July 2009,"There are movies that deviate from the source material that are still good movies like Wolverine for example then there is Dragon ball. This was a waist of a DVD.Where they went wrong: Goku: the actor was good but he needed some kind of Muscle tone, its sad when Tobey Maguire was bigger in spider man 1 then this guy is playing Goku. Master Roshi: Chow yun-Fat made no effort to portray Roshi, give me a bald white bearded Asian man with sunglasses, how hard is that? Yamcha: three words, Jar Jar Binks. The Martial Arts Tournament: it was round, come on how much more effort would it have taken to make it square and a raise platform. The Kamehameha: What the F*#k James Wong. I've seen better homemade videos of people doing the Kamehameha on line.The things I felt were good: Emmy Rossum's Bulma: I loved her portrayal of Bulma, strong, beautiful and carrying guns. James Marstars' Lord Piccolo: he was great but there was not enough of Piccolo kicking a$$. Eriko Tamura's Mai: she kicked a$$. Randall Duk Kim's Grandpa Gohan: he was great, to bad he dies in the first part of the movie."
tannerxk3x,Honest opinion from long-time fan.,3/10,11 April 2009,"Through the beginning of the movie, it was exactly what I had expected it to be. I never thought this movie was going to be a fantastic adaptation of the anime, especially when they didn't just start with Z. When you have to cram 150 episodes into a 1 1/2 hour movie, you can't expect too much.The ""high school"" transition kind of made sense, only because if a child was the main role, then before it even came out, the movie would be given up on. And Chi Chi was a babe, so....whatever.OK, back to the actual movie aspect of it. It was an entertaining movie to watch for the first half, only if you were a fan of the anime, and weren't being an uppity little kid about it. ""OH THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENED, ROSHI WOULD NEVER SAY THAT"" etc. I started gaining hope for this movie during the candle lighting scene, that was done really well. However, once they began the last fight....I have a few major problems with it.They made the biggest deal about Piccolo returning, about how he's the big bad wolf of the era. The fight between he and Goku may have lasted all of what...five minutes? And once Goku flew up towards him, I thought ""Wow...they're actually gonna have him do the stomach punch-thing"". Summed up what ACTUALLY happened: Mini-explosion, Piccolo's laying there dead for one frame, Roshi's dead, and now they have the Dragon Balls to wish him back. And when Shenlong just came out, didn't say A WORD, spit on Roshi, and then everything was normal....that was right about when I decided that this movie wasn't really worth seeing.Now they can do one of two things with this...they can either leave it alone, forget the sequel(s), and just let us enjoy the anime again. OR, they can look at the debacle that this thing was, LISTEN TO THE FANS on the message boards, and make the sequel the right way. Who knows..."
sugarmesweet427,My childhood memories are fading as we speak.,1/10,2 August 2009,"I cannot believe that anyone who was involved with this movie has ever even seen the entire Dragonball series. First of all, why is Goku some white kid with gelled hair? They couldn't find anyone that fit that part better? really? and second, I would really like to know why they completely ruined the plot. Why did Master Roshi live in the middle of the city? why did Bulma not have all blue hair? why was Yamcha not afraid of woman? why why why did they make this movie? there are so many things that they completely ignored that could have been so easily fixed. There was no need to change the storyline that much, that is why we all loved it in the first place, the original effing storyline! I am so angry that this movie even exists. I think they should release a personal apology to all the fans of the original anime. I could have written a better screenplay in my sleep.

matrixblde,Should not be watched,1/10,5 August 2012,"I guess if you know absolutely nothing about Dragonball or Dragonball Z then this movie is simply a poor movie with a poor script. BUT if you are familiar with the long running manga and anime then this movie is absolutely horrible, just horrible. I can understand the difficult nature of taking a very long story and making a movie about it but they should not totally rewrite the whole thing. In this movie the Main character Goku is a older teen where as DragonBall dealt with the boy Goku. In all of the manga and anime Goku has been a pure heart,fun loving scrapper. Even that was too much depth of character for the movie Goku who seem to only be a normal type of guy with little distinction. There is zero character development and some of the central aspects of the series are poorly changed. (Spoiler) Take for instance the only point where Goku changes into the large Gorilla Ozaru, he willfully changes back. In all but the very last of the anime the change is uncontrolled. Also in this movie Goku has no tail, which is key to transforming into the Gorilla, by which the removal of the tail ends and or prohibits the change. It would have been better to simply not included this at all. This movie should simply be forgotten and never brought to mind."
Firia_lyta,An I the only one that liked it?,6/10,28 July 2009,"By and large I think, Dragonball Evo was alright. It wasn't ground breaking, or necessarily a mirror of the original Dragonball series. It's quality wasn't exactly stellar either, though.I'm an artist, and a fan of the Dragonball universe. I wouldn't want to make a movie that was a mirror of what has already been made. That'd be like me trying to recreate the Dragonball comics. In terms of making a movie based on something as extensive as Dragonball, there are sacrifices that need to be made. There are over 100 eps of the original DB universe, and that needed to be shaved into a single movie.All the base elements are there. Roshi is a perv, Goku loves his food and rigorous training at the hands of Roshi, Bulma has capsules (which was her big thing in the original series), there ARE capsules, Yamcha is a desert bandit, Grampa Gohan raises Goku, etc etc. The base elements are all there, and the director deserves some credit for even making that effort. Not every director tries that hard.Now, do I agree with all the liberties with the characters made? Not at all. Roshi was a hoot, but wasn't a bent over OLD man. Chow Yun Fat did a brilliant job with one of the series' most memorable characters, but there were some aesthetic changes that didn't sit right with me. Also, no Krillin. Yamcha, but no Krillin? Dang.Ironicly enough, Dragonball Evo maintains the history of pacing issues renounced throughout the Dragonball universe. Except for episodes full of staring and gruntings, it was lightning fast the whole way through. It even felt rushed by the end.Riddled with flaws, and by no means the perfect take on the Dragonball universe, it was still kind of entertaining. :) It has all of the base elements necessary to make a Dragonball movie, and it's own unique twist of the story. They did alright, I think. :) Now they need to train their movie making skills to make a better movie. :) Train at 100 times gravity!"
alexis-4012,So bad it's good,5/10,20 June 2022,"Yes, the movie is terrible from every point of view. But, when you accept that this is more a fan fiction than anything else, and it's one of the worst movie ever made. You start to laugh and have fun at how ridiculous it is.Highly recommend it.

blastermaster587,From a former Dragonball Z fan.,1/10,14 July 2012,"It has nothing in common whit the dragonball animation series. Its a totally different universe, they just stole some ideas and characters from it and turned it into a ridiculous childish movie. Off course dragonball is made for children but in the animation series the makers created a deep and very interesting universe whit extremely powerful characters who combine martial arts whit fantastic powers.When i watched that series long ago i really wanted to be like those characters,i wished i could make my hair turn yellow while flames cover my body and all the dirt flying up and started spinning around me.I was expecting the same feeling from that movie, i know its not easy to replicate that but they didn't even try.Dragonball deserves a serious movie really based upon the fantastic universe we know from the animation series.Don't bother watching this."
hassoonk,I can't believe that Akira actually allowed this to happen,1/10,12 February 2020,"Its kinda shame that they name this movie after dragonball. The whole movie creators have no clue what's dragonball is. This movie is disrespectful.

TheOtakuX,"A great, and underrated, movie",8/10,31 July 2009,"I saw this at the first showing, and bought the Blu-ray the day it was released. I don't know why everyone is so afraid of change. It was a great movie, the acting was good, the effects were great, the costumes were amazing, and the changes were enough to make the story interesting to someone who's read the manga and seen the anime (like me). A direct adaption would have been boring. This version changed stuff around and made it work. While it's true it could have used a few more characters from the original stuff, that still seems like a fairly minor complaint, as more characters would just mean they'd have to introduce them, which would bog down the movie. And to the people who complain about hair color, what works in animation doesn't always work in live action, and that's a REALLY minor thing to complain about.

jake-r-midgley,awful,1/10,3 March 2013,"This movie is nothing in comparison to the original Dragon ball/DBZ anime if they made a movie out of dbz properly that would be sooo awesome!! But this one sadly was just awful. Piccolo was not like Piccolo, the dragon balls weren't made that way, everything about each character was wrong, Goku is much different. The feel of the anime is what gives Dragon Ball z that unique touch, but I guess we'll never have that technology to be able to make a good enough movie out of it. And they probably think there aren't enough fans, I think differently as I see how there are 6 million people who like the facebook page that alone is a lot for a Facebook page, and then the word spreads about how good it is and the advertisement should draw people to see it as the tech should be insane as the fights are just Awesome!

thequequeque,movie was the worst attempt at an adaptation I've ever seen,1/10,10 August 2009,"this was the worse adaptation to anything I've ever seen. i grew up watching dragonball-dragonball Z and this was a terrible movie. first off to start goku is on his own since he was a kid. he met everyone in the movie when he was small, master roshi was bald, bulma had blue hair. they couldn't even get the basics right. then came the fact that this movie was so disgraceful to anyone who had ever seen any of the dragonball series. it looks like the director caught 2 dragonball episodes and thought he could try and make a movie out of it. if just wish someone who actually knew about the series would try and make a movie not someone who had no idea. the movie didn't even mention that goku was a saiyan. and what the hell does air bending have to do with anything this isn't avatar

calico54-180-206998,Trunk needs to hop in his time machine once more in order to prevent this atrocity from ever becoming a reality,1/10,8 November 2021,"If young Trunks had to choose between an Android free future or a future where DragonBall evolution never sees the light of day, I would advise him the latter.This is THE BIGGEST desecration possible to one of the most captivating heroic tales ever told.Goku a lusty high school student. Why?Krillin inexistant. Why?Roshi with hair and no turtle. Why ?Piccolo with a human subordinate instead of his demonic minions. Why?Goku transforming into a werewolf instead of a giant ape? U serious ?Goku, who is known as the fighter who loves combat most, afraid to fight? (Even made a promise not to fight again?) Why ??!?I could go on but it is clear to anyone who ever knew the real Dragonball that it is a world class insult to Akira's Toriyama's legendary body of work.This deserves a rating of zero stars, and has about as much use as a zero starred dragon ball."
thesolidmidget,What were they thinking?,1/10,22 November 2021,"I can't believe in 2009 I got hyped for this... Whatever it was. I don't recall seeing it in theatres. But renting it? I thought I enjoyed it. But after watching some YouTubers discussing it, like Doug Walker and remembering it... I was laughing to myself. Making Goku some relatable young adult that goes to school and had bullies? What's up with that? And how he slid his head across the hood of the car. I can't go on. Memories of that movie are flooding back and I don't like it one bit."
Mentally_Divergent,EXACTLY like the original dragonball cartoon (1986),10/10,11 April 2009,Freaking awesome! everything was pretty spot on the same pointless quick story lines couple fights chuck in some kahmahamahas kept very close to the story of the first cartoon the only thing that let it down was Goku being to interested in girls and school which seems a bit more like Gohan then Goku. Roshi was still a dirty old dude i really loved it! I went there expecting it to be a giant big piece of poo-jabber-wocky really surprised there could have been more filth and nudity and some dinosaurs but oh well. CHOW YUN FAT made that movie... not in a literal sense cant wait for the sequel they should move into Dragonball Z territory

Transsive,A solid movie effort,7/10,31 July 2009,"Dragonball is an anime rated about 7 (check out anidb), and I felt the movie is worth just about the same.Viewing advice If you only watched Dragonball Z, you will be disappointed in this movie. This is supposed to the based on Dragonball, the manga with a lot less fighting and a lot more silliness and fun. Please watch it in HD if possible. Leave all your expectation at home and you'll see the changes they did were appropriate for a movie adaptation.Spoilers ahead!I have seen the anime in Japanese and dubbed in German a few times and wasn't disappointed with the movie. Since it had such a low rating here I decided to watch it with 0 expectations. I feel they did a good job in capturing the essence of each character and I managed to enjoy it.Of course since it's supposed to be realistic movie a lot of things had to be adapted. No animals, no nose less Kuririn or 3-eyed Tenshinhan, they wouldn't have fit in the plot anyway.The premise is this: what if Gohan hadn't isolated himself and instead chose to live in the US. There he trains Goku and lives a somewhat normal life. Since Goku grows up in a city he isn't as dimwitted as in the anime. But he's still slightly naive (fighting Chi-Chi instead of Mai). His interest in women wasn't too off (the city corrupts, ha ha)Bulma was spot on, nothing to complain. Yamucha was OK and so was Muten Roshi (perhaps a little too young though), though thankfully still slightly perverted.I also liked the fact that they kept some Japanese elements, some names, some dialogs and a few songs.The one thing I feel the movie lacks is a little more hand to hand combat. The anime was also a lot funnier."

jamesoshea33,Good movie it really is,9/10,18 March 2009,"I have talked to Japanese people who liked the movie. Basically people who hate this are people who did not want it to be made in the first place or people who have there heads up there own buts,who think they know everything. Come on some of the stuff in dragonball will not transfer onto the big screen without looking annoying and cheesy if you want that just watch the anime. The story in this was pretty good except for a few parts oozaru did not need to be in there because it was pointless,the high school part lasted like 4 minutes all in and even though it was funny because goku acted dumb even in school and when he beat up people it was gokuish and comical as well but it was pointless and there was no need for it.Piccolo and yamucha did not have enough face time and it had the most anti climactic ending ever it led up to a huge fight then just ended really bad but the kamehameha was well cool. OK i don't know if this is a spoiler or not but the end lasted for like 3 minutes all in and even though it followed the basic storyline could have had a better fight they punched each other like twice then blasted each other a few times. The characters were great i loved everyone of them i don't care what people say they all acted great. But the movie was too short that was foxs fault cos they cut out a lot of scenes which made it look choppy and left a few plot holes but even though they could have left in some scenes they cut out the parts we all hated like the 7 mystics part and goku infamous line 'im not ready for this' it was a good movie all in maybe some bits were stupid but it was fun and it did have a dragonball feel."
robbybaggio10,Wasted my time,1/10,23 July 2009,"What a joke Please make a new Dragonball Movie with some better characterizations and do it right...Start from Dragon Ball Z if u wish, as it's the better, and if u succeed u can go back to dragonball (past) or dragon ball gt (future)But u must pick at first the better one, like LUCAS did with STAR WARS...So the first movies should have been:First Saga: Vegeta; Second Saga: Freezer ; Third Saga: Cyborgs ;Fourth Saga: CELL; FIFTH SAGA: BOOO BOOOAnd please choose some better actors... Master roshi is bald u bastards.... Bulma has blue hair etc etc etcThis director should be banned from directing more movies or at least should have been some organization that protect some stories from being told by incompetent people"
pepk,Very surprised at how much I enjoyed DBE,10/10,15 April 2009,"I had seen the trailers and was not impressed, and only went to see it because James Marsters was Piccolo and surprise, surprise I LOVED the movie. Going to go see it again and have preordered the DVD. I had seen some of the TV series, but on the big screen with real actors was awesome. Don't follow the sheep that were bad mouthing this movie before it ever came out, go see it and form your own opinion, it has lots of action, never bogs down and the story moves quickly. James is excellent as Piccolo, of course being a big fan of his I would have like to see more of him, but he is all the way through the movie, in fact all the actors gave top notch performances. James IS Piccolo, just like he is Spike, he has made this character his and what fun that is.

nolanmrky666,Not as bad as you may have heard...,7/10,8 April 2009,"Alright, I am ready to be flamed. Honestly, I had heard nothing but absolutely bad reviews of this movie, and after seeing the mediocre trailer, I didn't expect much. However, after watching it, I didn't think the movie was such a train wreck that it was made out to be. Yes, it was short and character development suffered, yes, there were key elements left out, but in the grand scheme of things, the movie was actually enjoyable. Put yourselves into the shoes of someone unfamiliar with the Dragonball franchise (not me, I've watched it for years) and then review the film. I know this movie was a huge blow to Dragonball fans, but hey, it could have been a lot worse, right?Chatwin was actually alright. During the first fight scene, he almost flawlessly captured Goku's playful (fighting) attitude. However, things went downhill from there. At times, he was whiny, and at others, he was emotionally devoid. Yamcha was poor in general, as there was virtually nothing for his character to work with. Roshi was alright, being the perv we all know and love, as well as the fairly badass martial arts instructor. But Bulma and Chi-Chi... phew. Stab me. Overall, I think the movie should have been at least three hours long and given much more character detail (Yamcha). But, all things considered, it wasn't too bad. You should go see it, if only for the giggles."
PerfectCell80,Dragonball had soooo much potential....BUT....,1/10,5 March 2010,"The Dragonball series had sooooo much potential to be an excellent live action franchise. The series has a loyal fan base and the action of DB would appeal to any movie lover, but in order for this to happen the franchise must be handled by people who know what the HELL DRAGONBALL was about. This garbage isn't Dragonball, this movie is more closer to High School musical than it is to DB. You can tell the writers of this crap weren't fans of the series, because the only similarities between DB and this movie is the Title and some Character names. I am not going to place the blame on the actors because it isn't their fault that the writing and casting sucked. (How are going to have a white Goku??? That's like having a Japanese Superman...It doesn't make sense)...But yea don't waste you time with this one....

LockeAndDemosthenes,I haven't laughed so hard in the cinemas since...,7/10,24 April 2009,"*SPOILERS* Y'know those movies that are always pushing up against greatness (or even mediocrity), but never quite make it? The type of films where the plot, dialogue, acting, cinematography, set design and direction may all be just about competent, but there's a truly terrible choice of music which pushes it down into the bargain bin? Films which are generally forgettable except for a few irritating decisions.Dragonball Evolution is not that movie.The very conceptual basis of this film is so flawed, so utterly devoid of artistic merit or entertainment value, that it defies comprehension. The script doesn't just tell a bad story, it openly does violence to the concept of a coherent narrative, driven by the understandable behaviour of its characters. The plot openly begs so many questions you find yourself not bothering to ask any more after a while.Why, if he has been raised in almost total isolation by his grandfather, does Goku attend a stereotypical American high school? How come he still believes in all this apocalyptic nonsense about aliens and demons if no one in the outside world does? For that matter, why the f*ck doesn't Goku seem to realise he has bloody SUPERPOWERS compared to his peers? And why, if his grandfather had refused for eighteen years to tell him what happened to is biological parents, would he DITCH HIM ON THE NIGHT HE PROMISED HE WOULD? Has he no curiosity about his family? He doesn't even call the cops when someone murders his only parental figure and demolishes his house! Furthermore, how has Chi-Chi become a world-class martial artist without anyone in her family noticing? Who the hell are those monks we get introduced to three-quarters of the way through the movie? If Bulma was planning to make a fortune out of somehow using the dragon balls as an energy source, why does she only start searching for them AFTER the one she does have is stolen? Why the hell is Piccolo roaming around in a bloody ZEPPELIN if he's supposed to be imprisoned in the Earth's mantle? And why does he even WANT to destroy humanity? For the sheer hand-rubbing evil of it? Then you have the porn film dialogue. ""Don't worry, we still have our dragon balls""? ""Go back to what you were doing""? ""I must be true to who I am""? The exchanges in you average Resident Evil game have more resonance.Toss in some Razzie worthy acting by the leads, compounded by hideous characterization (Goku comes off as a sociopathic retard, while Chi-Chi is more of an egotistical b*tch), along with set designs and special effect worthy of Power Rangers, and you have possibly the most ill-conceived mainstream Hollywood film this side of, well, Uwe Boll.And I loved every minute of it.This film is so unremittingly awful that it had me and my mates in stitches from the hokey exposition dump at the start to the obligatory end credits theme song. There are moments (such as the sudden shift into Twilight cinematography for the dream sequence, Chi-Chi using her tits to encourage Goku to learn the Kamehameha, or the first meeting with Bulma) when you can't actually believe that at some point someone thought of them and decided they should be put on the big screen. The whole film is littered with moments when you just can't help turning to the person next to you and loudly asking ""what the f*ck did that have to do with anything""? As it goes on, you can't help but feel that the cast and crew where in on it. Surely they couldn't have thought any of the choices were good ideas? It's as if, once they realized that they couldn't get out of making this ridiculous dreck, they decided to make it as hilariously awful as they could.By the end, you feel this weird kind of catharsis that can never reach in a merely bad film. You feel that peculiar rush of elation of seeing something that goes so utterly wrong at every point as to remind you of what a GOOD film should be. My response, and the response of every one else in the theatre, was to laugh harder and more frequently than I have in many a year. I don't know, perhaps only people who grew up watching DBZ every day before school will react that way, but for my generation at least, this could be our Showgirls or Jaws 4. You'll certainly have more fun than in mediocre dreck as HSM 3 or the next Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer collaboration."
daiymojack,Life Changing,10/10,11 April 2009,"Unlike all the other small minded individuals that have given this movie 3's and below, I was able to use my brilliance to see the true genius of this film. Any one who can't appreciate this movie probably doesn't have a high school degree. Although this movie did not follow the cartoon at all, it didn't need to because it was so good. It was called evolution for a reason because when things evolve they get better, just like this movie. The depiction of piccolo was the greatest character study ever, hands down, don't argue. This was better than Heath Ledger as the Joker and even Toby McGuire as spaceman. Hopefully people will be able to pull their heads out of their behinds and appreciate this great vision for what it really is. As an up and coming film maker myself, I am using this great flick as the foundation of my own movie making. Therefore, the film has been life changing. Goku is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nod. I really hope Fox is smart enough to green light a sequel, I think we could have the next great saga on our hands. This could be bigger than Star Wars and Rocky put together.Final thoughts - WOW"
yaynoob,Dragonball Evolution - A Great Movie,9/10,18 July 2009,"Dragonball Evolution - Am I horrified, when it comes to this film? I think not. But what I am horrified about, are all of the so-called 'Dragonball fans' who are talking like idiots, about a film that is exceptionally great. Do you know how stupid you sound when you post something like 'Bulma would have been better if her hair were blue?' or 'Justin Chatwin is going to suck as Goku, because he doesn't look like him'.Yeah, okay - He doesn't look like an animated character. Don't be stupid. You all are finding the dumbest reasons to hate this title. It's either because .. 1) This movie didn't follow closely to the original storyline. 2) Characters didn't look EXACTLY LIKE the originals. 3) Some scene had ""bad"" special effects. You have to give an amount of 'Leeway' for this film - as like other films, none are perfect.I find the actors' performances were at their best, and the action scenes were awesome. I and other Dragonball fans enjoyed the efforts of the film's creators/staff. Yeah, the movie had its faults - but for the most part, this flic is a blast."
zfnbler,Hated for sake of hating it.,10/10,19 January 2023,"To me personally Dragon Ball Evolution was a pretty fine movie despite its flaws, if taking it as a standalone movie based on Dragon ball concept, characters and elements. Due to backlash, it received we end up missing out on more DB live action movies for better or worse. Some major influencers set the pace & trend of hating it usually under pressure of and to appease loud & proud haters and other people followed, just hating it for the sake of hating it like NPC sheeps one after another. It wasn't widely hated when it first came out but haters won eventually and shaped the opinions of everyone else.

seydaed,This Is good for all who doesn't know DB,10/10,23 July 2009,"This was a great movie, even for a true Dragonball, DBZ, DBGT fan. The acting was ~alright~ (Ive seen worse!) They changed the plot a little~ but thats what needed to be done and it was set right! The effects were awesome! I though it was a very good/(genius?) way to incorporate Dragonball into a live action film and hope there is enough fan base for there to be more (wishing for a trilogy! at the least!) As a fan of Dragon Ball and after watching this movie I've started re watching all the episodes of it all starting with #1. I hope this isn't the end of the live action version cause it puts a lot of things into a more real perspective. I give this film 2 thumbs way up!

tsmrushhour,Absolutely very good film,10/10,7 June 2017,"Why are people complaining and giving it horrible ratings? I love the fact that I can watch my favourite anime on my flat screen mirror!Love the animations and fighting scenes, it's almost as if I can feel the pain he is feeling. But that might just be because I'm getting whipped by my dad.Absolutely love this movie"
PurpleSDF,"Unfaithful to the anime, yet still worth your time",6/10,10 April 2009,"As a HUGE Dragonball fan, I was psyched to the announcement of a live action movie a few months back; but as more information was revealed I started to lose faith. A few days prior to seeing the movie, I had lost all hope of it being remotely good. A 3/10 on IMDb spells disaster. After seeing the movie I can say that I am pleasantly surprised. Although the story was Americanized and modernized to hell and back, it did have its moments of faithfulness to the original manga/anime, specifically with the characters. Goku was very different from the anime, but it was good in its own way. Chatwin did a good job with what he had to work with. I was especially happy with Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi. I was skeptical of his placement in the movie until I saw it myself. He did a fantastic job of bringing the Master Roshi we know to life on the big screen. Lets not forget Yamcha either; he too was able to very faithfully recreate the original character. I was not big on Rossum Bulma but she did do a decent job. Marsters was a good Piccolo but he didn't get as much screen time as I had hope for. As far as anime faithfulness goes, there were several other things throw in that surprised me as far as getting them right but I won't go into detail, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. Overall, Dragonball Evolution is a decent modern martial arts film with some neat special effects, cool action scenes, but not a faithful adaptation to the series we all know and love. My final verdict is a 6/10 but I could be swayed to a 7/10. Don't let its inaccuracies prevent you from experiencing a new twist on the same old (amazing) story, its still worth your time if you enjoy a good old action movie."
cubbie5277,This guys and idiot.,10/10,16 June 2009,"After reading the review posted on here I decided that it was time to watch the movie. Since this person said it was horribly made, and I am such a big fan of DBZ I thought that maybe I should sign up and put my own opinion.First of all, I think that the movie started just as it should for people that have no idea what Dragonball is all about. I found the story line, acting, and special effects to be phenomenal. I personally cannot wait until the next one comes out. Obviously you have to be as big of a fan as I am to appreciate the excellent quality of this live action version of Dragonball. To wait as long as I have to see this movie the author of the main post on IMDp is obviously not a fan but just a critic that didn't do his homework and has never watched the anime version. At least not enough of the anime version to understand the storyline. This person only wanted to see huge Ka-Me-Ha-Me-Ha Waves and total destruction of cities and floating boulders from so much raw Ki power. That is not possible at this juncture of the story line, IDIOT!!!! The fight scenes, well one word- Awesome!!!! I personally suggest that anyone interested in Dragonball should watch this movie and understand it for what it is, if you know anything about the story line of the anime then you will know what I am talking about. I don't know the Japanese translation of the show however if the English dubs of the anime are in accordance with the Japanese spoken language minus the profanity then this movie is right on. This is the beginning of what I hope to be a series of great live action Dragonball movies. As always though someone from another country has a bur in their butt about the Americanized version of and over seas phenomenon.In closing I thought that the movie was great. Thanks for reading."
EndlessDesire,KamehameWAAAHHH!!!,1/10,16 July 2009,"Dragonball Evolution, a film based on the hugely popular anime of the same name, minus the evolution. More like a devolution. This film strays so far from the series, fans will be shaking their heads in despair.*****SPOILERS******So many plot holes I'll not bother to name them all, but ones that really annoyed me was Goku being the SAME Oozaru that went on a rampage with King Piccolo over 2000 years ago?The Oozaru in the film is only about 7ft tall, when in the anime it's roughly 200ft! I understand the makers were going after a sense of realism with this, but when we have a superhuman 18yr old who can manipulate air etc etc etc, all realism goes out the window.This film would have been 1000 times better if they had of given us the proper back story for Piccolo by introducing Kame and showing us (or the casual watcher) where they actually come from. Bring in Goku and co (WHERE WAS KRILLIN!?!?) and have an all out brawl in the mountainous desert. Just that would be far more enjoyable than the thing we were given.*****SPOILERS*****If I were to recommend this to anyone, it would be 5 to 6 year olds. It's like watching PowerRangers without the spandex.If you are a fan of DB/DBZ/DBGT, please steer clear and save yourself the heartache."
conn231,Are you really that surprised?,4/10,31 March 2011,"If you would have told me in 2008 that there will be a live action Dragonball movie coming out in a year I would have told you two things: ""what a dumb idea"" and ""it's going to be terrible"" I am a huge Dragonball and DBZ fan. I watched the show as long as I can remember but I even knew a live action movie would be terrible and I knew not to get my hopes up. People tell me ""This movie was awful! I hate them so much for making this!"" Okay.... the TV show that this was based on was Dragonball not Dragonball Z. Dragonball is a show about a ridiculously strong kid with a monkey tail that goes on a quest with Bulma in search for the Dragonballs while fighting the red ribbon army. Goku was about 8 years old, maybe even younger. Goku could break rocks with his fist, get shot in the head and live and shoot energy beams from his hands. OK now knowing this... what the hell did you expect the movie to be like? If you walked into that theater to see this movie praying that they did a good job on it you have the most ridiculous expectations. OK enough with my rant. I will start with what I liked about this movie. Yup, you read right; I said liked. I think I liked the movie before it started to get into the plot. I liked the Goku character. If you didn't know his name is Justin Chatwin. The best movie I saw him was Chumscrubber. He played a jerk very well. I thought he played the awkward guy when he was Chichi very well. When male actors play awkward around the girl its just uncomfortable for me to watch rather than it is funny. The way Justin did it with Goku I was laughing; it was funny. The fight scene with Goku and the bullies from school I thought was pretty cool. He did a Jackie Chan and made the bullies beat each other up and I thought that was entertaining. But after that scene the plot started kicking in. The plot was a really dumb video game. The whole plot was for Goku to go here then here then here then here then beat the bad guy. The sound for the film was some what OK but the light wasn't that good. The other fight scenes were awful. They cut the shot so many times in fight scenes half the time you can't tell what is going on. There was this awful plot twist at the end. They didn't even know how to pronounce the names. They said Gohane instead of Gohan and they called the dragon, Shenron, they pronounce Shenlong. That's a big problem with these kinds of movies. People that don't know the show or anything are the ones making these movies. *cough cough The Last Airbender*Despite all these awful things in this dragonball movie.... at least its better than The Last Airbender. This movie is really really awful there is no doubt about that, but after I saw this movie and watched out of the theater I thought to myself ""nice try"" That was pretty much what you should expect from this movie."
nikita119944,I thought the movie was AWESOME!!,10/10,10 August 2009,"I know everybody is saying how lame this movie is and that it's nothing like the anime,that everyone was out of character and that it generally sucked...But I beg to differ.This movie is based on the graphic novel...BASED ON!!...so it's supposed to be almost nothing like the movie.I hate how everyone thinks that a live action movie of a manga is supposed to contain every single detail,but it's almost impossible to get all that information in an hour and a half movie.So what do you do? You make your own story so it can fit the time.If the lord of the rings movies or harry potter movies contained all the details of the book then the movies would be 5 hour plus movies. I thought it was an awesome movie.It didn't portray the actual manga,but it fits more the profile of a tribute to Dragonball. So summed up this movie was a TRIBUTE.

heavenlover_dj,Director's heart might want a change sometimes!,7/10,27 March 2009,"The movie has not yet been released here in my city, I hope they do release it. As a ultra fan of Dragonball series , I really expect everything to be as same as in the series, I heard a lot of rumors during my survey that this movie is going to suck big time and stuff, but I really think in a different way! According to the survey, I came to a conclusion that Yes, all the characters and scenes and relations has been changed drastically but that's what director is suppose to do! He gave us Goku, Bulma, Piccolo and all the other characters back but just in a different way! Please, If you truly are a big fan then try to appreciate Wong's work. At least he tried..*anyone who knows about the actual release date for ""Dragonball Evolution"", then please let me know at my email address*- Thanks....

cremix2,Even as a non DBZ fan I loathe this POS movie,1/10,20 June 2018,"I don't like DBZ at all so when I was on a 9 hour plane ride to Greece I thought I could enjoy this as a dumb action movie, I was wrong! I couldn't get through 10 minutes of this garbage fire, I even tried watching it with the volume off so I can ignore the horrible dialogue but I still couldn't get throught it. No joke I just decided to stare at a black screen for about a half hour until I fell asleep on the plane.

ben_taylor_93,Don't judge on what you know. Approach with an open mind!,5/10,26 August 2013,"This film had so much potential and i remember the hype for it checking websites everyday and getting excited about all the images coming from the set BUT!!!! this is nothing like the anime/manga/video games or whatever your DB vice is.Taken as a standalone film knowing nothing of the original series this is a nice fantasy martial arts film with an amazing soundtrack and special effects, the characters have only elements of their manga counterparts Goku eats a lot, Bulma is a scientist with a blue streak in her hair, master Roshi is a pervy old lech, Yamcha starts as a big headed bandit and in my opinion king Piccolos make up is stunning.I believe the costumes are stunning and have a nice modern take on the originals which i do believe are in it, you see them in the scene in which Chi Chi gives Goku sympathy over the death of his grampa in the desert where she trains.For the true DB/DBZ/DBGT fans stay away from this film because you will be utterly disappointed, approach it with an open mind and separate it from the series and continue to pray with me that one day, just one day a Dragonball film will come along that is as faithful to the original series in every way."
Themattman1,Basically the Disney Channel version of Dragonball,5/10,20 April 2009,"*Mandatory Disclaimer: There may be spoilers below.* When an anime is reinvented for whatever reason, it is fairly common that an effort is made to retain the atmosphere and feeling of the original show, even in the case of movie adaptations (Casshern, Cutie Honey, etc.). This is where DBEvolution falls apart.In Dragonball, you start out in this very rural, forgotten valley where a little boy with a tail and magic staff named Goku lives by himself, isolated from society. In Dragonball Evolution, you start out in a suburb in a Californian looking area where Goku (bearing no tail or staff) basically resides as a standard teen-movie high school outcast.Basically, the talking animals are gone, the epic landscapes are gone, and the futuristic buildings have been reduced to a glowing mess of what could very easily pass as LasVegas at night. You kind of get the feeling that Goku lives in a very congested area. The journey doesn't really take you anywhere as particularly breathtaking as you would desire from a movie adaptation of a show that would have provided such opportunities. I sympathize with the movie crew however. This may have been a case where they were trying to avoid looking too much like an anime. American audiences don't take too well to 'live action cartoons.' Speed Racer was indicative of that. Unfortunately, the style has limited appeal. Of course, the DB fan base may have been big enough to allow for a big impact of the 'live action cartoon' style. Honestly, I would have preferred it.Then there are the characters. The Original Goku was uneducated, naive and was overly self-assured. DBE Goku is shy, self-doubting and seems much too well educated (and non-Asian) to be Goku. Really, he and Bulma change places personality-wise. No longer is she a teen girl looking to wish for a boyfriend while exploiting Goku as a bodyguard. She is now a gun-toting vigilante type who initially tries to kill Goku (her dynocaps are cool though!). Roshi and Yamcha bear a little in common with their anime counterparts, but nothing significant. Overall, it's as if basic relationships and names were borrowed and everything else was rewritten.The acting was amusing to me. Some of the actors seemed like they were trying to tone it down, while others seemed like they were playing it up (though Yamcha might have just been a bad actor to be honest). The overacting would have worked out better had the movie been a bit more cartoony, but no dice.The music wasn't bad. The ending theme seemed out of place and the music seemed to overpower some scenes, but considering the budget, I think they did good.The effects weren't too terrible either. Some looked really awesome while others looked painfully fake. The great ape sequence looked a bit cheesy to me.Overall, I still give it a 5. As bad as it was it wasn't nearly as bad as people are saying. The main mistake this movie made was expecting people to already be familiar with dragonball while ignoring the fact that the fan base who grew up with the cartoons wouldn't appreciate a Disney Channel style adaptation of their show.The entertainment value IS there though. It is pretty kid-friendly and the younger viewer will probably love it. This may be a great segue into your kids sharing your love for Dragonball.I will say this though, if another adaptation is attempted, I hope it will be done in the style of Final Fantasy: Advent Children. That style would really suit Dragonball Z especially.Thanks for reading!"

longpause,I was ......... surprised,7/10,10 April 2009,"While the movie was lacking in ... several aspects of the anime, I was surprised how well it turned out I was even surprised I managed to get goose bumps during certain parts. Perhaps it was because like the anime it got to the point a little quicker? Don't get me wrong I appreciated that in the anime however they did have to squeeze a whole saga into roughly two hours that impressed me. Overall the movie could use more as for what that more is who knows. I agree that Goku looked nothing like I expected him to. Wishing for more....I did like that they tried to add every aspect of the anime keynote TRIED.. ""A"" for effortby the way -- the end scene was lame

envia-mensaje1,Awful..,1/10,19 March 2014,"Everything in this movie DOES NOT resemble the real Dragon Ball anime series. Dragon Ball is one of the greatest stories ever made, yet this movie is not even close to a single episode from the original.This movie remains me of two other Hollywood made movies based on two beloved video games series:Double Dragon, and Super Mario Bros.Those games are fun, they have an ""interesting"" story, the cartoon series are fun to watch, yet the movies suck, they are lame.It's almost as if Hollywood were intentionally trying to remake awesome series from Asia with the lowest crappiest quality as possible to make them look bad. The only thing not added this time was musical intervals with the typical dancing and the singing to add their typical touch of junk.Avoid this movie like the plague."
gnomesofthewest,Exactly as Expected,4/10,17 April 2009,"When you go to see this movie, don't expect much. Nobody else did. It was evident from the trailers that the special effects were lacking. What they don't show you is that, in places, the special effects are stellar... but those scenes just aren't important. Goku jumps into Piccolo and his jump looks like an 8 year old copy and pasting in Microsoft Paint. BUT, Piccolo drops an energy ball into the water and we bullet-time in on the water drops. The effect is visually interesting but not at all important to the story.The problem with Dragonball is that it IS very hard to translate into live action. Nobody will ever be happy with how the characters look or the changes that had to be made to make the story go faster. That being said, a lot of things changed to make the movie faster. (I would have suggested either starting the movie with Grandpa Gohan dead or combining the characters of Roshi and Gohan. The second is a significant change but neither Roshi nor Gohan were important enough in this movie to warrant spending so much time with them.) Another thing evident from the trailer, Goku is older. Another thing, he has no tail. Minor changes considering nobody would want to watch a movie about a 12 year old.Bulma, Chi-chi, Yamcha, and Roshi's introductions are all awkward. But, these were big characters who needed to be introduced fast. The gist of their characters is intact. Yamcha wants the balls to be rich. Chi-chi is secretly a fighter. Bulma now wants the balls to be famous (as opposed to the perfect boyfriend). Roshi is mildly perverted, toned down from the cartoon show, but, of all characters, Roshi keeps the most accurate representation of the anime to the movie. In particular, making Goku run behind the car, carrying an obscene amount of weight. Personally, I didn't want to watch 2 hours of Goku training with Roshi just to have to pay another 7$ to watch Goku and Piccolo fight next summer.The dialog is awkward. Incredibly awkward. A few times, I actually felt uncomfortable listening to it. I asked ""did someone really just say that?"" and then I cringed more thinking ""did somebody really WRITE that?!"" Piccolo's origins are completely revamped, disappointingly. This is largely because the history of the Dragonballs was also revamped. I wondered why they didn't cut a few scenes (maybe with Chi-chi) to add in Kami and properly explain things. That way, when/if there is a sequel, Piccolo could be deployed a lot easier.There was 1 change in particular that I thought was great. Instead of transforming in a full moon, Goku now transforms when he sees a complete solar eclipse. These are far more rare. Problem is, he doesn't have a tail and it still happens...It was evident to me, throughout the movie, that this was a jumping point for another movie. I imagined them skipping clean over the rest of the Dragonball series in order to introduce Raditz, Nappa, and Vegeta in the next movie. The basic points were established to get there. Goku crashed (on a meteor?) from a foreign planet with no knowledge of who he was. He's becoming stronger in Ki and has the Oozaru in him. Now that the main characters have been introduced (with a few glaring exceptions), the next movie could jump to adulthood with no consequence. We have no reason to watch more of Goku's childhood now. Especially since he's turning 18 at the movie's opening."
emtemss,Dragonball: Evolution?,8/10,11 April 2009,"So who saw this coming? A Hollywood live action rendition of the most popular anime of all time? Well if you have been a die hard waiting for the past decade as licensing rights were volleyed back and forth than Im sure that it took all too long.Now to be sure this movie is an adaptation of the original Dragonball Manga as written and created by Akira Toriyama. It is not an adaptation of Dragonball Z, so don't expect anyone to say anything about Saiyans or Frieza or to even hear Vegetas signature laugh.At it's core this film does manage to grasp the most base of character depictions. Master Roshi is still the hentai he was in the manga and Goku is actually looking for vengeance on the one who killed his grandpa Gohan. Bulma is dead on as far as her character, Yamcha is the surfer dude bandit of the desert and Lord Piccolo is still trying to get the Dragonballs. They maintain a level of martial arts action that is surprisingly accurate and yet they shy away from too much string fighting.All in all this is not an award winning film, but it is still a very heartfelt pushed forward film based in the world of Akira Toriyama. By the way, Mr.Toriyama Executive Produced this film as well as helped with the writing process."
ccrosby83,DBE is good foundation,10/10,3 June 2009,"This movie is good in my opinion, not great. Why do you a great movie all the time? I pick out movies based on my personal preference and not on popularity. Only a few million saw this movie in theaters and no you have not seen it unless you see in theaters and not the bootleg incomplete one on the internet. I have seen this movie five times and it gets better. Those you do not like the changes and feel betrayed should grow up. It's just a movie and a good way to waste an hour and a half. It doesn't have anything I wouldn't want to see. Especially the ""Strawberry"" scene. Just because Goku is a white guy with no tail and wants to talk to girls is not a good enough reason to kill this thing. It's an adaptation and Hollywood always puts there spin on things. This is a revitalization of the series which ended over a decade ago and needed a fresh start. Watch this more than twice and you will like it too.

zachyb89,can someone answer this,4/10,30 March 2009,".... Not to get in to too much about what's wrong with this movie, but one major question i haven't seen addressed is where the hell is krillin?? He was almost the comic relief for the cartoon. He was not the most important character, but didn't he grow up with Goku? I may be wrong thinking he should be in the movie, but he trained with Goku and Master Roshi.. If anyone could shed light on that it would be much appreciated... And it appears that the director tried to make so much of an Americanized version of this film that he did an almost twilight type dragon ball, which does not belong anywhere in this movie. It was a great cartoon, and even better manga. I have not seen the movie yet, but i will go see it, even if just for reminiscent purposes, I just hope I am not let down. Again please someone tell where Krillin, the bald little guy with the disc, is at?

shibachu,Surprisingly good,2/10,10 April 2009,"Truth be told I came to this movie with a dead set hatred I had the same feelings that a bunch of fans seem to be having, that 20th Century was going to completely destroy Dragonball. I walked out of that theater with a smile and curiosity blazing. I am a long time fan of the entire Dragonball series (DB, DBZ, and yes even GT) and throughout the entire movie at the back of my brain I knew this was different, that these filmmakers had diverged greatly from the source materials, and to the ""hardcore"" DB fan I feel this is the primary reason for hate as it was mine. That nagging thought seemed to dwindle as I watched, yes there were many changes to the story and yes the characters and locations have been tweaked a bit, but overall I began to like it, dare I say I became attached to these representations of long beloved characters.Overall the movie was well composed. The script was good with bits of decent humor tossed in my only gripe there was the fact that they pronounce ki like 'key' instead of 'kai' which I guess isn't really a flaw since it can be pronounced either way. The actors played their roles well. I must admit that Chatwin's portrayal of Goku seemed a mite bit weak (but hey it might improve in subsequent movies, if there are any), and Rossum's Bulma seemed a little more violent that I really expected. The only actors I can really draw poor ratings against have to be Tamura (Mai) and Marsters (Piccolo) and even then my only faults with them are that both have about maybe 10 lines of dialog each in the whole movie, and Piccolo's make-up was... odd I guess would be the word. The effects were great, whoever did the effects appeared to have allot of fun with particles when it came to the attacks especially in the final battle. The only problem there was that Oozaru (the big ape) was a bit strange, the scene with him in it is and incredibly fast scene and the camera angles chosen combined with the pace make it hard to discern that Oozaru is even an ape at all in points or if it is just a person in a large monkey suit. The fight scenes were pretty cool as well, very well choreographed in my opinion. The whole thing made me wish it was a bit longer, actually, the movie seemed short even though I've heard that the American release is a half hour longer than the Japanese one.All in all what I guess I'm trying to say is I am a Dragonball fan and at heart I genuinely liked the movie. In the end that final bit played and the credits rolled and I was left sitting in my seat asking for more and questioning where they will take it next. I truly hope that those haters out there if you hate it and haven't seen it please go see it and give it a fair shot. If you have seen it and you still don't like it think of this; Though the story may diverge and the characters are a little different, this movie is introducing a slightly newer generation to Dragonball which ended a little over a decade ago (if you include GT from 97'). Give this movie a look see you will be surprised at how good it actually is and I truthfully hope that there will be more in the near future."
abeautifudream,let's not be unreasonable,5/10,27 July 2010,"Okay to start this off lets all give them at least a little credit here because lets think about it. Had they made the characters and the world look exactly like it does in the show it would be pretty ridiculous. With Goku's big hair how it is, Bulma having blue hair, and dinosaurs in the world, imagine how that would look as a live action movie. Or if they had given Goku his tail and made oozaru like in the show? The show was a cartoon/anime creating a live action version of the show is not the same as when they made movies of cartoons such as the Flintstones for instance. The movie is called dragon ball EVOLUTION. it's not going to be exactly like the show and there will probably never be a movie like the show so be happy with what we get.Now as far as the movie goes most people are judging it by comparing it to the show but lets throw that aside. We have chow yun fat, Justin Chatwin, Emmy Rossum and Jamie Chung (who in my opinion is one of the most beautiful girls out there) amongst other great actors. If you've seen some of their other movies their pretty good at what they do. So it's really a pretty good cast and the chemistry wasn't lacking in my opinion.As for the movie I'm not going to tell you the story line or anything. But the movie was OK, its not the kind of movie to be nominated for an award but if you look at it as its own kind of movie and not a live action of dragon ball then you can really watch the movie and it really is an entertaining movie. it's not the kind of movie that you will watch over and over again but its not a waste of time either. the script is pretty mediocre but the fighting is pretty good.so overall i rate this a 5/10. I'm usually can be a pretty harsh critic but i try to put myself in someone else s shoes. Too many people don't understand what it takes to make something like this and are selfish. but get over it people and give them some credit.***If in any way i have offended anyone with this review i apologize. Nothing i said was meant to be offensive in anyway. Just my opinion and review of the movie.***"
bradbeeson15,great movie,10/10,15 April 2009,"this was a great adaption. its not exactly like anime but if it was it wouldn't have worked. and for all those people saying that it ruined there childhood and goku was never a teenager how could they do this to dragon ball z. 1st this did not ruin your childhood DB Z is still DB Z there not going to go back and change it to look like this if you want DB Z go buy the DVD. 2nd goku was a teenager he was 14 when the comic started and had to be like 16 17 when he battled piccolo and no he didn't go to school but gohan did i have a feeling there trying to mix the two i don't think there going to put gohan in the movie. 3rd THIS IS NOT DRAGON BALL Z ITS DRAGONBALL people are getting angry that it doesn't have enough action and all goku dose is train. he doesn't train that much if you ever read the comic goku trains almost every episode there wasn't a whole lot of action in dragon ball it wast until Dragon ball z where we saw the intense earth busting battles. over all great movie go see it don't download it

mrxcrackers,Garbage,1/10,27 June 2009,"As soon as the theatrical trailers came out, I could tell that this movie was going to be horrific... but I didn't think it would be this bad...First off... the only things that resemble the manga/anime series... are pretty much the names (and the small part with Roshi's bikini mags). Other then that they butchered it.If you are a fan of the manga or the anime... then I don't recommend that you watch this.There should not be a part 2... ever. Throw it out... complete garbage. What needs to happen is someone that actually knows about the series needs to step up and make a whole new movie. Like the first Hulk... haven't watched it the whole way through yet because I keep falling asleep. But the new one with Edward Norton was great! If they actually make a second part to this movie... it will be the biggest waste of time and money. I would be surprised if they sold enough tickets in one day, to fill up the whole theater."
noise_06,"terrible movie, one of the worst films i have ever seen!!!",1/10,27 June 2009,"wow. how can i put this? it was just so bad. i love Dragon Ball Z, used to watch it all the time when i was little, so i know a lot about the series. this move was just horrendous, even i could have directed it better and made a better movie. the storyline is nothing like the cartoon. they tried to make it to modern, it wasn't kept original. they took the entire story line and flipped it, just tossed it away and kept the characters names, nothing else, nothing resembled the original thing. it was just terrible. the story line sucked so much its unbelievable. the special effects weren't that good, considering its 2009 and technology is just beyond amazing.the characters didn't resemble the real characters in the cartoon at all, since when did Goku go to school? since when did Goku meet his future wife at school and have a party? why doesn't Goku fly? why does he turn into Osaro if he doesn't have a tail? and the monkey looked horrible, usually the monkeys are giants in the cartoon, this one looked like a werewolf. theirs so many characters missing, the costumes where horrible, the hair, make up, everything. the scenery ware terrible. they tried to make the effects look cool, by adding slow motion and that, like at the end when Goku and chi chi fight, it just looked so lame. it basically looks like a movie you would see on Jetix, like one of those power rangers films, but even they look better.i was speechless when i watched it, it was so bad, i felt sorry for the actors in the movie, i would have been embarrassed to be in that movie. this movie just kills the feel of the cartoon, i was just shocked. the movie started and like 10 minutes into it, i was already bored. i wouldn't recommend it at all, very bad movie, one of the worst i've ever seen, 1/10, it gets a one for the effects which were average. Don't watch it, it's a very very very bad movie. needs to be remade by a better director and better casts."
valespinrizzo,"an unparralled,unrivaled,unbliebable,unconpairible experience",10/10,27 December 2022,"Dragon ball evolution is, in short, a phenomenal film.truly the absolute pinnacle of human creation, It is a beauty to behold for the mind, the ears, and the eye. Everything pales in comparison to this work of art. Better than ""The Godfather"" in every way. Makes ""Lawrence of Arabia"" look like ""Birdemic"". At the end, I cried through the ending credits because of the beauty of the ending. The film's acting makes Daniel-Day Lewis' work seem pathetic. The realism packed into the performance of the complex character Piccolo really affects the audience emotionally. This movie makes me hate Scorsese, ""Goodfellas"", more like ""Badfellas""! ""Taxi Driver"", more like ""BADxi Driver""! Don't get me started on ""Raging Bull""...The film ranks up with films like ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Casablanca"" in its excellence! Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman must be crying that they didn't accomplish a collaboration to make this film. ""The Seventh Seal"" is so bad compared to this, I mean where were the seals! I'm serious, that movie is really bad.It is both an original and a clever homage to some of history's greatest films. It is a pioneering achievement in the art of filmaking, one that shall never be surpassed. This film will draw you in, and it will touch you. It will make you feel a powerful range of emotions which you have never felt before. You will laugh, and you will cry. You will rage, and you will fear. You will be sick to your stomach. You will ultimately feel a satisfaction unmatched by that which you have already experienced.The plot is beautiful it has me gripping my seat for the full length of the runtime every time that it blesses my screen. It has no holes, despite my scanning of the movie's script for any form of inconsistency or plot fallacy. The plot twist of Goku being Oozaru was the greatest ever seen in cinema on a level that has never been seen before.Dragon ball evolution is more than just a movie. It's a personal experience, an experience that will change your vision of life. The characters were realistic and beautifully written. The protagonists are the greatest to ever grace the big screen I felt like I knew them. Nay; I KNEW them. While I was watching the film, I considered them my closest friends. Their struggles, although foreign, were also relatable. As I watched them overcome their fears and their prejudices in order to save the day, they taught me that I, too, could be the hero. It made me rethink everything I thought I knew about society, heroism, and morality.As for the source material? This movie is nearly identical and yet still managed to vastly exeed it, I, for one, used to absolutely love it but after seeing it transformed into such high art I would rather die than even MENTION it again.I've spent days trying to write this review, to even try to fathom the beauty I've seen. I've tried. It's impossible, far too good for me to write a review within human comprehension.This movie is truly a miracle. I used to be a beta male, no girlfriend, no money and my dog forgot my name before running away but after seeing this movie and going to a church dedicated to this movie, my dog learner English so he could tell me he was sorry, I got 100 wives and I became super rich. When I'm outside every guy in a one hundred km radius comes to ask me for tips on being a sigma male. It cured my cancer fed my starving children,brought my grandmother back to life and told me that I was beautiful just the way I amJames Wong (the wonderful director of this film) is more than a filmmaker. He is a PROPHET. Mere words cannot express how thankful I am for the existence of his masterpiece. I envy the people who have never seen it as I wish to watch it for the first time again, it felt like losing my virginity in my eyes and ears. We are mot worthy of such a perfect gift as dragon ball evolutionThanks to Wong, we finally have an answer to the age-old question. God is real, and He is Dragon Ball Evolution.A solid 10/10, If i could,however i would give it a fifteen billion trillion million thousand hundred fourteenth billion trillion million thousand thirteenth-billion trillion million twelfth billion trillion -eleven trillion-ten billion-9 million-8 thousand-7 hundred One billion gagillion fafillion shabadabalo shabadamillion shabaling shabalomillion and 6 out of ten.Enjoy this movie, embrace it, love it closer than your family, and finally feel like you have to do nothing more in life."
ALclar,Total waste,1/10,2 August 2009,"Let me start by saying I never write movie reviews online, hardly ever even give suggestions to friends. That being said let me continue by stating the fact that growing up I loved this series of cartoons and got really angry when I missed an episode. I had low expectations going into this movie and when it was in theater my friends didn't want to see it so i didn't get to see it. But then it was only a dollar to rent to I figured why not right?Bad life choice. Movie was terrible, short, unfulfilled, not accurate to the cartoon version and left me feeling like I wasted my life. This movie's only saving grace was there were two hot Asian girls. I can't believe they made an 18 year old Goku!? At least get that right!! Well even though the curiosity killed the cat this time, I can safely say I will not be seeing the sequel to this (unless I get bored again and get curious) but honestly, terrible movie, don't waste your time especially if you were a fan of the original series."
shadow_skater,I LoL'd so hard watching this! Hilarity ensues,3/10,4 August 2009,"LoL, OK, so here is my revue on this movie. Seeing as Dragonball and Dragon Ball Z were a big part of my early childhood, I was taken with nostalgia and decided, ""hey, why not."". Let me tell you, this movie is funny as balls, more specifically, funny in the way you laugh while watching those old b-rated horror movies on VHS in them moldy boxes you found in your mama's attic. The one liners are as cheesy as David Carusso's from CSI, and the special effects team seemed to also be taken by nostalgia and decided to go all retro. But then you realize it's the same special effects team in charge of the original Mighty Morphin Power Ranger special effects. No jokes, check it out. The bit where Goku (SPOILER ALERT!) animorphs into that big foot looking thing, you realize the costume specialists probably got drunk and totally forgot to fabricate a legit looking costume, so (ANOTHER SPOILER ALERT) they bus'd it down to the 24/7 walmart and bought the 20$ skunk ape costume three sizes too big on the sales rack mid November. Regardless, I was a happy camper while watching it, worth a few chuckles. I also happen to be fried out of my mind. Holy cow. Sucks how you cant swear. Go watch the movie and share your thoughts."
takkal_redouan,Worst movie ever,1/10,27 June 2021,"Bad scenario, bad actors, bad fx. The person who wrote the scenario has never watch Dragon Ball and does not understand the characters of the best manga/anime ever.Don't waste your time to watch it.

mike_inh,dragonball evolution..... why?! for gods sakes why?!!?!?! ><,1/10,21 August 2009,"-10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 is the actual score I want to post.basically: do not watch this movie - E V E R -It is not really anything to do with dragonball(z/gt). They took the characters, about 0.0001% of the plot, and sucked the soul out of the whole thing, firmly bending it over and totally ****ing it up beyond all recognition.Even people who have never had contact with the original manga and anime will say this is the worst movie ever produced.So much is wrong with it. It is impossible to defend this.please torture to death those responsible for this horrific cluster****I mean did they really think that fans of the original series would watch this? Any fan of the series would have walked out after the first 5 minutes(and i am being generous) and demanded a refund, and possibly compensation for severe mental trauma.BURN ALL COPIES, AND NEVER LET THIS HORROR HAPPEN AGAIN! ANYONE INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS SHOULD NEVER WORK AGAIN! ANYONE INVOLVED IN CREATING THIS SHOULD ISSUE A FORMAL APPOLOGY TO THE FAN BASE!I WOULD SOONER WATCH A STATIONARY TURD AS IT DECOMPOSES THAN WATCH THIS MOVIE EVER AGAIN!"
Unleash-heartXcore,Could have been worse,7/10,10 April 2009,"This is probably one of my personal most anticipated films of all time. Though I was really excited for it, I didn't have very high hopes of it being decent. Hollywood has this nasty habit of destroying decent mangas/novels/video games. So going in my initial thoughts were, ""Oh man, this is gonna blow.""It didn't completely blow.The things that really irritated me was Oozaru wasn't gigantic, krillin was absent, master roshi (though he did an AMAZING job capturing the ""spirit"" of master roshi) didn't really look like him/ where were the sunglasses and longass beard? And Yamcha looked like an idiot.Apart from obvious storyline flaws and the whole Goku and Chichi going to school thing, I thought it was fairly good."
epmwilson,I don't even wanna say nice try.,1/10,26 November 2021,"I don't even know where to begin on how this film messed up a great animation series. This movie didn't even touch the show in anyway other than the names of the characters & moves. This is the worst depiction of DragonBall. Fox has to do better. Try again, get characters that fit the roll. And who actually look somewhere near the characters. If not that. Give the characters their original personalities. I think k this was half asked and not cared about at all. Total waste of time & money went into this film.

turnone,"The movie was good, yes it could have better but it was really good.",10/10,30 August 2009,"For all of you who don't agree with me, sure the storyline was a little off, but if you think about it many people have only read the animes and mangas, but not a lot of people haven't read the original story. ""The Monkey King wreaks Havok in Heaven."" There is another movie that relates to that book its the ""Forbiden Kingdom."" Once you have read that story you will come to realize that the anime and mangas have been a little off the original storyline. As the movie it was good, If you would have stuck to the original, there would have been a lot of things that the director wouldn't have been able to depict in the movie. I am actually looking forward to seeing the sequel.

anthony-mcclay,What did you expect? following the story line?,10/10,10 April 2009,"Lets understand, most people going to this movie grew up watching Dragon Ball (Z,XT,ABC,XP) or whatever. Most followed Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, and loved the characters from Goku to Yamcha. (Krillen was missing)I thought the movie followed the story line as best as non-animated characters can. It is a movie people! I loved all the characters the plot (Although known) and the settings. OK, the Dragon could have been better and Piccolo was mucked (Does look like a Buffy vampire) and a few more let me say Director's vision issues. But, I loved the movie!Anyone who followed the animation, should like the movie. NOTE: The marketing team is doing a horrible job promoting the movie on television. Say what it is not the garbage I saw on TV. The bad promotion made me take time out of my day to see the movie, before I start reading the bad reviews from people who obviously did not see the movie."
rupa14,think outside the box!,10/10,2 May 2009,"if you honestly went to see this movie and expect it to BE dragonball, then you were upset, i mean come on, its something new and MORE real than any of the episodes, yeah they did some goofs and I've seen every single DB and DBZ episode even the GT and this movie was great cause its real life and wasn't that bad of acting, i mean yeah they could of had 4-5 hours of talking....yes talking over 125 episodes of 291 episodes in DBZ was dialogue! and every dbz fan know that, and DB was just as bad,so imo this wasn't that bad and people need to watch it open minded and do NOT expect the same thing that happens in DB , cause i mean come on its a not a cartoon its hard to make people do that they do cartoons on screen and make it look very good. people can hate all they want i enjoyed the movie, and its 1 line jokes here and there,for a kid its a very good movie, for an adult it hits a brick wall of ""we wanted"" but ""we got this....."" like i said im a very big fan of the series and enjoyed the movie still.

chronostryder,Behold the magic of the original,7/10,11 April 2009,"Here is the original I mean really people, the original wasn't all that great. http://www.onemanga.com/Dragon_Ball/1/11/ It was the fact that it was in your own personal world that you opened up to it in the first place. In all honesty the last movie i saw was twilight. So with that in mind, the acting was great. Hollywood actors usually don't get into there 'powers' in these types of movies. Although Piccollo did look a little funny, but he was borderline. The tone was silly and mischievous, the same as dragonball. If you didn't like it than go read a few chapters of the one above and write a review on that.

rte1999,Screw Fanboys... it is what it is,6/10,13 April 2009,"First of all, I am a DBZ fan. And unlike most of you idiots that want to belittle anything that has to do with dragon ball manga, I take it with a grain of salt. The basic problem with the movie is that no matter how hard you try you can't cram 130 episodes into a 90 min movie. But all of you seem to think that it is possible... right. And, oh yeah, I totally forgot... HOW COULD YOU LEAVE OUT KRILLIN!!!!! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING... I mean it would be so realistic to have a midget playing the strongest human on Earth!(s/n.. for those of you that are just bashing to bash... Krillin is only 3 feet tall) Oh yeah... Yamcha didn't fight...because we all know how much of a fighter he was in DB! No Puar...GEEEZ.. cause a shape shifting cat would be believable. ( I didn't leave out oolong... just felt no need to comment because all he does in DB is try to scare Goku... and then promplty gets his a$$ whipped) Although I could go on for hours about how retarded everyone of you are (knowing you will own the DVD) My real point is... IT IS WHAT IT IS... you spent your money to go see it... and there will be a sequel, and you will go see it.. because we are human and curious.. so before you start an internet petition.. don't be gay sparky! Don't be Gay! For the review.... its an adapted movie that fanboys will hate.. because.. they're fanboys... for the rest of the world... its a movie.. you will like it or you won't, End of story. So grow up, and move on."
hackmxc,I don't have words to express my dislike for this movie,1/10,5 August 2010,"Dragonball unlike anything else is a show that is really meaningful to me, I GREW up just like millions of others watching this awesome show, i like millions of others became a devoted fan, Purchase the entire DVD collection also the anime movies, and every so and then i watch the entire 3 sagas from episode 1..When i heard of this movie coming up, and all the budget they were going to spend, I JUST SAID, please let it not be like Iron man, hulk and all the other money that were just made for the money, BUT I WAS WRONG, THis is not just a money, you Don't HAVE THE RIGHT TO MESS with something so precious to millions of people and corrupt it for MONEY.YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CORRUPT SOMETHING SO MEANINGFUL, if i was a rich i would have send people to pay visit to the directors of this movie and teach them a lesson of respect..Another question, do the people that made this movie EVEN Watch the sagas? I feel horrible because i can't even express all the dislike i feel for this movie."
rion006,Dragonball movie was Fun and inventive,9/10,23 April 2009,"From a fans standpoint, the movie is obviously full of hacked parts that neither fit nor coincide with the actual manga or anime. The story should've been split into three parts. almost like a trilogy, and put together from there. It moves along too fast for any person that has not seen the series to understand. I was disappointed because my wife could not enjoy the show because she didn't know what was happening.Now, in hindsight and while I was watching it, I totally enjoyed the show. I am going to buy it because I want to see the story continue. I also hope that the director actually reads the story a ""little"" more before he rips up the storyline and puts it back together, forgetting some of the pieces in the process. However, he did do a great job of making it work. I couldn't of done that much or gotten that far into the story with such a short period of time.Anyway, Im happy I saw it and had fun watching it. It shouldve been more zany and crazier and full of funny parts, but I enjoyed it anyway! Hooray! Now time for the second, and better, one."
Matija_Bubanj,Light entertainment,4/10,16 August 2010,"Dragonball:Evolution is adaptation of a graphic novel made by Akira Toriyama.Dragonball achieved worldwide glory as a cartoon,but the movie did not repeated the success of the cartoon.Why?The answer is pretty simple.Most of the people who have watched and reviewed this film are fans of the cartoon.This adaptation is not bad at all.The acting,direction and the script are pretty decent,and special effects are very good.I think that if you have not watched the cartoon there are greater chances to like this movie.It is not very intelligent,but it can be decent entertainment,especially for young boys who love the world of fantasy and action.For adults it is recommended only if they want to escape from the real world into the world of fantasy.

matsha1226,"Stop complaining, fanboys",8/10,10 April 2009,"So I've heard a lot of bad things about Dragonball Evolution; bad acting, bad visuals, poor writing, etc. However, after seeing it I'm sorely disappointed in the Dragon Ball fanbase for being as closed-minded and dismissive of an excellent movie.As far as reviews on this particular title go, there were a LOT before the movie even hit the theaters, making me question the legitimacy of the sources. Either they were pirated, or a LOT of insiders decided to review express copies. The second doesn't seem very likely. Having seen the special effects myself, they look great - on the big screen. The ki attacks looked natural and fluid rather than over-dramatic and lightning-y. The acting wasn't nearly as bad as what I was told either, considering the characters that are being portrayed. In the end, it seems to me it was a load of internet junkies jumping the gun on what might not have even been a final production copy.Many say the story seemed rushed. It may have been somewhat, but more so to convey story than action. It was more cohesive to a long-time fan than a new-comer, but the point remains. Story and comedy have always been #1 for Dragon Ball, with a close second to action, and that seems to have been forgotten. Adaptations can't always have all of the original elements, as it doesn't work in one media as another. If you don't believe me, look at Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins.There is also a notion from many fans of anime that American adaptations are inherently worse. Emotions aren't conveyed as well, action scenes aren't as entertaining or believable, and aren't written as well. The main opinion is that the Japanese are just a master race when it comes to acting and writing, and this usually comes from whiny American kids who don't actually know anything about Japan. To those people I say: READ THE CREDITS. Akira Toriyama, creator and writer of the original Dragon Ball, is the Executive Producer.In the end, it just seems like it was never really given a fair chance. Nor was it seen as it was meant to be - in a theater. So if you aren't just going to automatically say it was terrible because you have a preconceived opinion from leaked footage, it's worth a look."
wyattpetrowsky,would highly recommend for a true fan,8/10,5 August 2010,"First of all not as bad. as I thought it would be I actually waited an entire year before finally watching it. I am a huge fan of dragonball and dragonball Z and from beginning to end of this movie it brought me back to the original characters and series that I loved. I wish it had more fight scenes with powers but they did a good job putting everything together. Also the plot followed the series well with only a few minor changes. Overall this movie was highly enjoyable and I look forward to a possible sequel. You can tell the director really watched the show and enjoyed it each character in the movie have the same essence as the cartoon characters.

jweltchek,"Not As Bad As ""FANS"" Make It Sound.",8/10,15 April 2009,"This movie has got to be one of the best adaptations of an anime ever. OK so Justin isn't that great of an actor, he still succeeds as a teenage Goku, and his hair is fine. Imagine an actor wearing a giant spiky mess of hair, it just would look too goofy, I'm glad with the way they went with it. Bulma was definitely bulma, Chi-Chi was a little off (missing her anger issues), and Yamcha was kind of lame. But Roshi was the Roshi we all remember, minus being balled. If you nitpick this movie then yes you will be angry, but if you look at the movie from a technical side compared to other anime movies, this owns. I recommend seeing it, and I cannot wait for DBZ.

edgarcaballero-03076,Far from what anime means for our generation,1/10,10 July 2023,"Regrettable attempt to achieve an adaptation according to the tastes of North Americans
Lacking the soul and charisma that characterized the anime; nobody within the production seems to have seen any chapter and it shows that they tried to turn the characters into superheroes of the time.They destroy the characters, add a non-existent love arc in the anime and the action far from what it should be, understanding that the effects to achieve it would be very expensive but at least they could have been more ingenious.I give it one star because at least, and that's being very kind, the main character's wardrobe (at the end of the film) shows a certain resemblance to the anime and I liked the effect of the dragon balls. And that they filmed it in Mexico, that's all I highlight about this film.

gaiamaiden-1,Dragonball....hell yeah!!,10/10,13 April 2009,"I went to see the movie today and i loved it!! I have been a fan for years now and when i heard this movie was coming out i couldn't wait!! I know some people have been giving this film bad comments because its 'not like the series', well I'm sorry but obviously its not going to be 'exactly' like the series, for one thing it was a cartoon! There is no way Bulma was going to have big green hair and Goku was going to have massive spiky hair. I think Akira and the other directors did a fantastic job. The storyline was brilliant and it did follow the cartoon series storyline for the majority of the film. And when Goku did the Kamahamaha wave i was so excited i was practically screaming! lol And Chow Yun-Fat did a brilliant job of portraying Roshi including liking the dirty mags lol The one thing i will say i was disappointed in was that Krillin wasn't in it, but i can live with that (plus he might be in the sequel).The fight scenes were also really good and they managed not to put in any of those noises where the characters sound like they are constipated lol They also did a good job of showing the characters Ki energy around their bodies.Im sorry if there are fans of DBZ that think it didn't follow the storyline or whatever but there is only so much live-action versions can do and considering what the directors had to accomplish i think they did a brilliant job. Also i read how strict Akira Toriyama was while making the movie, he wanted it to be right and i don't think he would have gone through with it if he thought it wasn't. I for one can not wait for the sequel, so DBZ fans please watch it and then make your decisions :) Just because it doesn't match some peoples high standards doesn't mean u wont enjoy it! KAMAHAMAHA!!!"
rockyb73,Give it a break!!!,10/10,18 April 2009,"Firstoff it was called Dragonball, not Dragonball Z. It did follow the DRAGONBALL story line a lot more accurately than i thought it would have. I realize this was not the blockbuster film we all wanted it to be, but it was pretty badass. So they got rid of the whiny bald-headed krillen and left room for the smoking hot girls to shine. Boo-Freaking-Hoo! P.S. He was dead throughout the entire King Piccolo saga anyway.They may have done a couple things wrong but DAMN that was a fun movie to watch!P.P.S. I really give this movie about a 7 but I feel the need to try and cancel out all the morons who give this a 1 just because Goku is white... RACISTS!

steve-4481,"I liked it, my kids liked it and my girlfriend also liked it (give it a go)",9/10,10 April 2009,"I am a DB fan I am 36 My kids are 6 and 4 (boys), the 6 year old is a fan, the 4 is not. My girlfriend is not a DB fan and she does not like fighting films.We all loved the film.As others say, it does not follow the anime exactly. But does that matter? does that make it a bad film? Some of the feature length DBZ/DB films contradict the cartoon TV series and other spin offs.For me, the start of the film was a little like karate kid (don't let that put you off :) )I thought the characters where portrayed well and not to many from the anime appeared.It had us all gripped in the first 5 mins, I was worried that my partner would not like it at all.We saw this at the cinema, the cinema had lots of kids in it and they were all quite throughout the movie. Kids quite in the cinema = good kid film. But... kid or not it's still enjoyable.I am eager for more, so many films could be made. especial from DBZ.Give it ago, you may be surprised, but if you are a hard core DB fan don't get to upset if it does not exactly follow the cartoon."
andasen46,Dragonball?,4/10,3 May 2009,"Hopefully the film company reads this!!! I agree with most of the reviews out there about this movie. I would have thought the companies responsible for making this movie would have done SOME research on the movie,or at least taken some polls/surveys from people who have seen the show. I think there was/still is huge potential for this movie...assuming they get away from the people who made this movie...like so many people have said follow more of the show. Just because some people would like to see changes like this on the screen does not mean the large majority of DB fans wanted such drastic changes in the characters. To me it seemed what they did was take a tiny part of the show and just made stuff up on the fly. Get back to how the show went. If the company does not know where to begin....start with season 1 of dragon ball z. I am guessing this was there attempt at the goku saga?(maybe) I mean come on even something as simple as bulmas hair..streaks of blue..what couldn't the company afford a bottle of blue hair dye? Like I said great potential for this movie...just don't try another one like this."
ajarno,"Fun movie, great for kids",7/10,14 April 2009,"Dragonball may not be an epic masterpiece, but it's so much better than you'd expect after reading the fans' rants here. It's a fun little movie that does a good job in capturing the spirit, if not the exact letter, of the anime. While the effects don't stand out as anything we haven't seen before, they service the story well without looking phony, and although there are a few plot holes, it's nothing as glaring as... well, a large percentage of the other movies out there. There were a few things that were probably explained or developed in scenes that may have been cut to keep the length down to something that's closer to a pre-teen's attention span, but everything moves so quickly that you don't have time to really ponder those bits before you're on to the next scene.Justin Chatwin has a lot of charisma as Goku, and does a pretty good job with the fighting. Yes, he's a teenager in high school, but from a practical viewpoint, a younger actor probably wouldn't have the acting talent to carry the movie (think Anakin Skywalker in Episode One), and would be prohibited from working long hours and doing some of the stunts due to Child Labor laws. I wasn't really expecting to like him as much as I did. No, his hair isn't sticking out in two-foot long spikes, but that would have looked silly in live action. Of course he'd get his hair cut to a standard length, otherwise everyone would laugh as he tried to get through doorways.James Marsters is perfect as Piccolo. He's got the voice and the mannerisms just right, and has just the right amount of menace. Chow Yun-Fat is hilarious as Roshi. Really, the only actor who didn't work form me was Joon Park as Yamcha. He seemed to be just smiling and reading his lines, without putting anything of himself into it, and the character himself just wasn't developed to the point that you could tell why the others would trust him or why he'd be helping beyond anything that's just for the money. I can't imagine them being able to add more characters in, if they didn't even have enough time to properly introduce Yamcha.Yes, there are changes here, but actually less than most other big-screen remakes of TV series. It's better than the Wild Wild West or Lost In Space movies, but then again, what isn't? And changes don't necessarily mean that it's worse. The new Battlestar Galactica made Starbuck female, made Boomer not only female but a Cylon, and the whole mythos is different, but it's great. And some of the changes that fans here are complaining about aren't actually in the movie, but were just in the trailer, such as the mystics creating the Dragonballs. They don't say that in the movie itself.So if you go in without a completely closed mind, you'll probably find yourself having a good time. And be sure to stick around until after they list the cast in the credits for the extra scene."
mistress-hotaru,It could have been worse....,4/10,21 April 2009,"I've been reading a few comments and decided to post one of my own. I was confused about the out come ever since I saw who they were having play Goku. Justin Chatwin? I'm not going to go through everything just the plot and my thoughts on Goku and Bulma.Bulma: What the heck? Why wasn't her hair blue all the way? And when did she become so trigger happy? Overall she wasn't Bulma. Bulma is supposed to be a boy crazy child genius. Not some trigger happy, blue streaked chick. Also She's supposed to be looking for the Dragon Balls, knowing full well what they are, and wanting to wish for the perfect guy. Goku: As mentioned before what's up with a Caucasian playing him? Granted, after reflecting, the not Asian thing isn't too bad considering that Goku is an alien. Still, couldn't they have found a decent Japanese guy to do it, though? Goku's personality was also different; he was never a show off and never pined for Chi-Chi. He was also too smart.Though Goku is my favorite Dragon Ball character he is dumb and naive (Well dumb outside of battle). Heck he thought marriage was a food. Justin Chatwin, though not Asian, did as good a job as he could have and wasn't half bad, just wasn't Goku. Plot: When I heard them say martial artists made the Dragon Balls three words crossed my mind. What, The, and, Fudge. The bigger WTF moment was when they mentioned the word 'Namek'. In Dragon Ball no one is supposed to know that word. The biggest WTF moment of the dialog was when they mentioned Piccolo's servant Oozaru. Oozaru is not a name, its a FORM! What was the screen writer smoking? After this we see Goku in a high school setting and see characters for what was wrong with this. Gohan was killed by piccolo. Goku has the 4-star ball, Bulma tries to take it. And it's loosely the Demon King Piccolo saga of Dragon ball with the exception that there's an eclipse coming. It all felt rushed and they seemed to be over selling the action and the comedy. Though, seeing them try to make this movie was comedic in its own way. So why the heck, sans tail, is Goku able to transform under the blood moon. Oh and what was with the puny size of the Oozaru? So DBE Goku does something DB Goku was never able to do, which was snap out of Oozaru form and gather the strength to fight Piccolo with lame speech about knowing himself blah, blah, blast piccolo, save day, wish Roshi back to life. Gets girl blah, blah. Unbeknownst to him, beknownst to us Piccolo is still alive. Roll credits.Any old school fan could see the plot twists (Such as Goku being the Oozaru) a mile away. There is one major question on this fangirl's mind. That would be, is Goku still a saiyan? The way they were presenting it had me doubting this. If that's the case the fan base will be in an uproar. As if they're not already.On to the positives:I could see a few, rare, moments when DBE Goku would pull a move that was canon and I'd nod thinking, 'Yep, that's Goku.' or do something I would shake my head at. Having seen every single episode of DB-DBZ and read all the DBZ manga, I'm pretty well versed in this. As such, the film could have been worse. By worse I mean book/comic book to film adaptations like Eragon, Jumper, or, Ella Enchanted. If you don't know why I'm using those movies, just look up the reviews left by people who actually read those particular books.I thought it was decent, which is why I gave it three stars. It entertained me, which was what it was supposed to do. As I am an 18-year-old, this movie wasn't as entertaining to me as the pre-school crowd might find it and were I not a long time fan of DBZ I might have enjoyed the movie a bit more. Also following the It-could-have-been-worse train of thought, It could have been like DBGT. Between GT and this I must say if I had to be locked in a room with a choice between this movie and GT. I'd pick the movie hands down! As far as I'm concerned GT does not exist. All in all DBE is like its manga and anime counterparts in that it supposed to be comedic. DB and DBZ's strong points weren't usually their plot lines and that's coming from a fan!Here's how I kept myself from getting angry during the film. This might help you too. In order to not be mad you treat it like every other DB & DBZ movie from the past.So, repeat after me: It's not Canon, which means it didn't happen. Say this repeatedly and you might calm down. Might being the key word."
drhannibal007,Rule #34,1/10,8 November 2014,"Mankind's worst attempt of trying to use camera's. The scenario is far worse than a day of me in the toilet. The man who made this masterpiece of garbage is clearly between 2 and at most 3 years old. Please someone on IMDb make an exception and rate it 0 or below if possible (NOT). Even if you don't consider the adaptation from Dragonball, which this is not the case, this is still one of the vomitory movies anyone could watch.Lumiere are rolling in there graves.P.S to MR wong, rename yourself to Wrong and do not attempt to touch any other anime ever again.

uchihamax,Better if You Admit it's More of a Parody,7/10,27 April 2014,"I get why this movie is hated on so much. It, in no way, resembles the original comics or anime beyond the names, some of the concepts being loosely adapted, and that's about it. But when I sat down to watch this and expected an absolute mess of a film, I actually found a mildly entertaining comedy that felt more like a Dragonball Parody than anything else. Yes, I'm keenly aware that wasn't their intent, but when you look at symbolism in film or books, sometimes what you see is not even close to the intent of the creator, but we believe that's what we see anyway. My first introduction to Dragonball Z was the Dragon Ball Z Abridged series on YouTube, and, as such, I've never taken the series seriously in anyway because, quite frankly, the source material really isn't that good on an animation level, narrative level, or even an action level. The original series is actually pretty bland. So when we get a movie that functions more like a parody and less like that bland boring nonsense the franchise started as, yes, I can actually enjoy it that way. It's sad we can't get more of this because I had a blast watching this. My favorite movie? Hardly, but it got me to laugh most of the way through the film (probably not for the right reasons) and, as such, deserves commendations on that alone. And if you really are on of those burned fans who can't accept the humor of this film as being a completely crap-version of Dragon Ball and legitimately want a good live action Dragon Ball, just stop. It'll never happen and this will likely be the closest you'll ever actually get."
David_climb173,Better than what I expected...but still kind of disappointing!,5/10,12 April 2009,"I expected a pretty bad movie considering all the comments I had heard about the film. I finally saw it today and I had a good time. I laughed a lot and the movie is not that bad. I was a bit disappointed when I saw the special effects....I have to say I expected a lot more. The acting was decent. Nothing out of the ordinary and the plot was OK, although it's kind of lazy sometimes. If there's a sequel they should try with a new director. Of course the cartoon is a lot better so if you're hoping to see a faithful adaptation of the cartoon into the big screen, then you'll be very disappointed. Dragonball has a lot of potential, they could really do Great movies with the story lines from the cartoon...just try a little harder!

slm845,Made me think,1/10,7 May 2010,"I can honestly say this movie made me appreciate the manga. I love it, but only got into it to impress a boy in my teen years. Seeing this god awful movie (which I knew would be bad, who DIDN'T know?), I want to go back and read the entire series just to wash it out of my brain. It feels like they pushed and pushed this movie back and like a school child who doesn't want to flunk by not turning in their project, they just threw together something and threw it out there hoping for participation points. They encompassed so much into the one movie that they had to leave out all the characters. How can you create Goku with no tail and a liking for girls? As my husband said, ""Goku thought marriage was something to eat!"" They wanted this movie to appeal to the ""consumer"", like every romantic comedy Disney channel production that is processed in Hollywood. God Bless the manga.

money_man_91,Why ?,1/10,1 August 2009,"I really don't see the movie deserving even the 1 star out of 10..It has molested the image of Dragonball Z/GT , which has been the hard work of anime-makers in Japan over so many years..They just destroyed the epic. The film-makers should go to jail for this. If there is a petition for blacklisting the film-makers from doing any more irreparable damage , i will be more than happy to sign it.The image i had in mind for Goku was destroyed and things keep happening on their own. Crappy directing/production. It's the perfect example of how you can destroy an empire by just shunning its king with some sort of rape charges.Watching the whole movie was too big a deal for me , but i ""endured"" ..yes , endured the whole movie just to see how bad it could get. And believe me it was much worse than i had anticipated. If you consider yourself a DragonBall fan , DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE! I absolutely Taboo anyone from watching it!

devyn-dominguez,Not Following the original Story,6/10,9 July 2009,"The movie had action, romance, and desperation but what about the little things? like the grand fathers suit was orange not yellow and the ""Ka-ma-Ka-me-ha"" is supposed to to be orange for Goku, why cant Directors pay closer attention to the little things? I'm a avid reader and watcher of the series for all 3 series Dragon ball, GT, and evolution and i notice all the small things that are the original in the Anime novels but not in this movie. My rating is coming straight out of the action and romance those were great but when it come to the little things you got to follow the book. In the Next movie they make of this series they really need to pay attention to the little things for us avid reader of the series to make us happy and not make the movie so corny. thing i would add to the next one would be that when you summon the dragon balls it was supposed to be in the language of piccolos ancestors, and last but not least get your colors straight that just plain out got me mad. Overall this movie is OK and should be seen at least once."
austan1124-1,Dragonball Evolution was decent,8/10,14 April 2009,"Dragonball: Evolution (Fox) is the story of a young man named Goku (Justin Chatwin - War of the Worlds, The Invisible) whom on his 18th birthday receives a dragonball from his grandfather Gohan (Randall Duk Kim - Matrix Reloaded, Kung Fu Panda). Goku decides that instead of eating a meal with his grandpa like he does every year for his birthday, to instead sneak out to this girl's party, in whom he likes named Chi-Chi (Jamie Chung - Samurai Girl). While at the party, an evil alien based on taking vengeance upon the earth named Piccolo (James Marsters - Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Smallville, Star Wars Attack of the Clones) attacks grandpa Gohan when seeking a dragonball (That Goku took with him to the party).When Goku returns home, he finds his grandpa lying on the ground nearly dead, who tells him to find all seven dragonballs (which when formed together can grant almost any wish desired) on the planet before Piccolo does, or he will use them in his plan to destroy the world, then Gohan dies. Goku sets out on this quest with friends he find along the way named Bulma (Emmy Rossum - The Day After Tomorrow), Roshi (Chow Yun Fat -Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon , Bulletproof Monk), and Yamcha (Joon Park - Speed Racer), to stop the evil Lord Piccolo.I thought this movie was good and deserves more credit than given. Other than a few problems like rushing to get the film done and having Piccolo's screening time cut short, the film is still good and has only few problems. Because it's not EXACTLY like the show, fan boys often hate on this movie, but it is out and was good and I would love a sequel (which is possible because of a cliff-hanger at the end), but seeing as how it had low promotion, much hate online (by fan boys), and was released a whole month before in Japan and therefore was seen by most as a bootleg, this film only made 4.7 million in the U.S and with a 50 million budget only made 42 million world wide.It's not anywhere near as bad of an adaptation as such things like Street Fighter, Super Mario Bros., and Mortal Combat. But ignoring most of its defaults, I give Dragonball: Evolution an 8 out of 10"
zardus,Pure Win,10/10,1 May 2009,"I don't know why all this hate's floating around for this movie, but the thing is pure win. Start to finish, it captures the essence of the Anime and the emotions I felt when I first watched it like 10 years ago. I felt like a 13-year-old watching Dragonball Z all over again! They took all the goofy fighting, goofy animation, epic plot lines, crazy characters, and condensed them amazingly from what would have probably been like a million DBZ episodes to a 90-minute film. They even had a minute-long charge scene!Seriously, don't listen to all the crap on here. Go watch this movie, and try to be a kid again.

andyowa97,"""Who put this fake movie here""",1/10,31 August 2022,"sincerely all of us fans or non fans, with eyes, a brain, ears, etc.I remember being excited for an adaptation as a kid then getting this absolute garbage. Who ever was involved wrote, directed and choreographed one of the worst movies let alone adaptations be made. From terrible CGI to casting being whitewashed to ruin something most readers would call an abomination. You could honestly watch the other japanese early 90s adaptation called ""Dragon Ball: The Magic Begins""and even with that one's flaws, it still blows this garbage out of the water with a fraction of a fraction of the budget.Ill always wonder how.20th Century Studios managed to mess this up so bad."
ssjdriver,It is what it is.,10/10,18 May 2010,"This is not supposed to be an exact copy of the manga or the cartoon/anime. The side characters are eh... but they are trying to put hours of story in about an hour and a half. All and all it's entertaining and fast paced. If you miss 5 minutes of this you will be lost. The writing of the dialogue kind of sucks.... This was made and supposed to be the pre journey before dbz-ish story lines come about. The side stuff with Bulma and Yamcha sucks but they had to rush it for the time they had. Oh well, it's supposed to be like DB not DBZ which DB was more for kids and so was this. I'm sure it will get better. Worth a watch though definitely.

supersaiyan1-1,My view on Dragonball Evolution...,6/10,9 September 2009,"I love DBZ too and it's hard to let go of the fact that there won't be anymore drawn by Akira Toriyama. So we should be grateful that they are actually making a live action movie. It may of sucked for some people but I think they did a good job considering it must be hard to actually pull off.I think when Chi Chi and Goku settle down with Gohan, then things will start to get better. Piccolo will be Gohans mentor once Gohan survive's six months in the wildness. While in the wildness Gohan will have to defend himself against the Dinosaur just like on the anime. Unexpectedly Gohan will transform into the Ozzoro leaving Piccolo no option but to destroy the moon, or say goodbye to the earth. The two Saiyan spacecrafts will crash land on earth - I think the graphics for this will be quite amazing. Anyway I just look forward to see what they'll come up with.

theshadowtiger-940-207185,My review of the show.,5/10,4 March 2014,"Okay I gave 5 out of 10 the game doesn't really follow the true story very well but it is still a good move. The thing I dislike is that one Goku didn't have a tail, two they was missing some characters ""Krillin, and Tein"" being a few. Also they never showed the world tournament at all which was one of my favorite things about the show. Also they left out goku's tail which was a big part in the anime. Also goku grandpa would not have been alive at the time goku was old enough to go to high school.The move could have been more better if they at least gave some flash backs prior to Goku being younger and why his tail was missing."
MovieKingfrom91,"Honestly if your going to make a sequel to this piece of garbage, make it straight to DVD not in Theatres.",1/10,29 April 2010,"Look I don't care if I spoil this movie for the people and DBZ fans that haven't seen it and really want to, well after what I write here you will not want to see this movie. Everything in this movie was bad. Nothing was related to Dragonball besides the characters and the Dragonball's themselves. Load of crap! Goku travels with his fellow friends all the way to some random desert just to kill Piccolo in one Kamehameha shot!?? I'm sure they could have gotten the 7 Dragonball's that easily right in the beginning. The fighting scenes were only like 10 minutes long. And the whole turning into Oozaru (which he looked like a werewolf and not King Kong as he usually would look like in the cartoon) accidentally killing Master Roshi and then using his birthday gift (the Dragonball) to restore him back to life? I didn't actually mind the characters looks that much (besides Roshi), but seriously the story line, the acting and the character development was horrible!!! If they were to make a ""Dragonball"" movie based on the TV series when Goku was a child, why not make him a child and then go along with him turning him into a Teenager as the story just goes along. Except the story was just also garbage. I know sometimes Hollywood changes around movie adaptions of anime or w.e because some fans will get bored of it since its like that allover again but in live action, that I understand, but for adapting a movie like Dragonball? You seriously can't really change it to like a stupidity pathetic look. Dragonball is one of the most Legendary anime's of all time, when fans expect a live action Dragonball movie, they expect everything real and high budgeted looking live action and good acting and at least its real proper story lines throughout the show's episodes. It doesn't have to include all episodes but at least kind of combine all the episodes from like when Goku was in a battle with Piccolo, develop it and the characters (which there was no character developing in this movie at all) and actually make it good, not make Goku look like some wimpy kid going to high school wanting to talk to girls. NO! no one wants that BS. We want the real Dragonball. I don't care make it 3 hours, as long as they got it all right. Not only that, if you make it as the real Dragonball, people who don't know about Dragonball would get more interested! But for DBE, it probably made thousands who didn't know about Dragonball think that this was legit live action based on anime Dragonball and everything about it. I hope your happy fox, not caring for the fans but yourselves and your damn money. You've taken a piece of art, crumpled it up and threw it right in the trash. For any mad DB fan out there that hasn't seen it, that either wants to, or doesn't, STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM IF YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CHILDHOOD RUINED! Bad movie, hated it with a passion, and I do not recommended it for anyone! (Even people who aren't fans of DB and never heard of it, because I don't want to make Dragonball look bad, and its just a bad film. Story, acting and developing was all TERRIBLE! What a load of piece of crap this movie is! I'd rather watch the remake of ""The Fog"" in theatres non stop the entire day and not giving a crap paying all that money for a trash like ""The Fog"" as well. Seriously why make a sequel to an unsuccessful film? Why? It was so bad! Get JJ Abrams, Spielberg, Bay, Tarantino, Rodriguez, Blompkamp (District 9 director) or Peter Jackson or a good director to reboot it or something! Wong was a bad director, never liked the Final Destination movies, and get a real writer to write something as big as the anime series especially if it was going to be adapted into a live action movie. No one wants to see a sequel to this crap!"
karim-elborno,It's a family movie,10/10,28 March 2021,"Relax. Yes it's not true to the cartoon, but just because it's not the same, doesn't make it bad. Enjoy it with your kids, or just enjoy watching the silliness and action.

oobymach,Everyone elses review sucks,5/10,1 May 2009,"No, I didn't all the other reviews but they suck anyway.Definitely not a 2/10 movie. Everyone who reviewed the movie need a slap. OK, so it was bad, but as bad as Bloodrayne? Hells no.First, it wasn't directed by Uwe Boll and as far as being a second rate power rangers? Who the f are the power rangers? I love 12 year old fanboys who review movies that didn't meet their exacting specifications.OK, so to actually review the movie you need to be aware that fox took the creative aspect into heavy consideration for the movie. Much of Dragonballs story has been altered to bring the movie to Hollywood, and some aspects make no sense whatsoever unless you've watched Avatar: the Last Airbender anime.They reference elemental attacks and the Kamehameha is an 'advanced airbending technique' which only makes sense if the Dragonball universe and the Avatar universe magically merge to destroy the Dragonball storyline.Taking the entire Dragonball series and setting it aside the movie makes almost no sense but is characteristic of everything Dragonball. They have essentially merged the entirety of the series into this one short movie which IMO isn't all bad.I could pick the technical details apart but in the end I was pretty satisfied with the first GOOD Dragonball live action movie. It is worth watching if you are a fan but be warned: it doesn't follow the story at all and many things are different than the anime series. Character names are there but that's where most of the similarity ends.I was only really disappointed by the tiny eternal dragon who somehow lost 99% of his mass in the conversion to film as well as his ability to speak, but having seen this one I definitely want to see the next ones.Dragonball Evolution is about a continuing evolving story and even though Hollywood screws up almost everything it touches they did an OK job with the first one and Dragonball is all about sequels.I would give it a 5/10, compare with 4/10 for Spiderman 3, 4/10 for Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and 7/10 for Ironman.The reason it gets 5 is for the altering of the original story, the lack of explanation to newcomers that Goku is an alien himself and other mostly story elements, typical Hollywood 'movie magic' and a few groaner moments that make you question why. eg, 'Piccolo escaped his magic prison somehow.' I hope they do better on the next one but this one definitely felt rushed and pieced together by a child who obviously had no prior knowledge about anything Dragonball."
fuller-jeff,Good movie with a lot going for it.,10/10,20 January 2012,"I think someone who has never watched the cartoons or read the comic book needs to chime in. A lot of these reviews are rated abnormally low because it didn't follow some story in some cartoon somewhere so I rated it abnormally high to come to the films defense.I enjoyed this movie for it's entertainment value and because I didn't have any pre-conceived notions. I wasn't expecting much going in and was pleasantly surprised.Justin Chatwin was excellent in this movie. He is a extremely capable actor who did a great job giving the lead role character and a cool personality. Chow Yun Fat did a great job as well giving the classic mentor/sensei role a great twist and humor you don't see in most cheesy video game/comic book based movies. Jamie Chung, who is absolutely gorgeous IMO, was reason enough to watch the movie. Her action scenes alone were much more realistic and believable than anything in that god awful wire-fu Chun Li movie."
daraghw708,Perfectly good idea gone to waste.,4/10,8 April 2009,"This movie was completely unpredictable when the trailers came out. Yes there was the fight scene and explosions and I could tell it wasn't going to suit the cartoon that well but to be fair, even fox knows that a movie with blond, giant haired body builders that are constantly on fire throwing each other through buildings isn't going to work.The movie itself was a complete let down but the idea had potential. In the hands of someone who actually knew what they were doing this could have been a very good film. Unfortunately for the public, we were stuck with James Wong who got the whole thing completely wrong. Besides doing his own job terribly he allowed other poorly skilled staff to ruin the film. The special effects were horribly unbelievable and the costumes were pretty stupid. I also personally would like to punch the script writer who thought that because it was based on a-let's face it- ever so slightly cheesy cartoon show they could make it as sappy as they wanted.I'm not saying that Dragonball Evolution is a bad movie altogether. If it was redone by one of the marvel comic movie directors it could be very good but considering how much of an atrocity this movie was I doubt any one would like to go near the idea of a live action version of Dragonball anytime soon"
trunkolo,Box office Potential,5/10,5 May 2009,"well, i wonder how long everyone will continue posting the same things over and over again. At this point most people are just venting. Its therapeutic I suppose. I guess many of us need this in order to come to terms with watching something so deeply routed into our hearts fall so fast and hard. Everyone is picking at one thing or another with this film and trying to explain why it ended up this way in the numbers and so on. But if you really look at the root of the issue it all stems from 1 miscalcutaion by fox.They were trying to make the film amiable for everyone but aimed the films production and story at a demography that was far to young for the general public to take seriously. The movie is fine if you look at it from a 10 year olds eyes. The youngest viewers don't read to much into it. So the story ends up full of potholes, lackluster dialogue, and childproof fight scenes and effects.In turn, the actual critiquing populous can only rate the film from their point of view rather than looking at it as a children's film. The script was aimed at very young boys but by it was promoted as a film for the general masses. Why not, its a billion dollar franchise that has lasted 20 years so it has to have a diverse audience to begin with. There wouldn't be to much work involved to convince ppl to watch it. But, after the first people watched it they didn't return to the theaters and told others it wasn't worth going. In general Only the 10 year old boys that it was aimed at may have been willing to go see it again and they don't have any money or a deep set love for the series since it is before their time.It doesn't seem as if fox realized the people who grew up with this stuff from 15 to 5 years ago were now at minimum in their teens. also, Writing and directing a script that limits its vantage point for they eyes of pre-pubescent boys severely limits the range of people that would be willing to watch the film or even give it a decent review.but Oh, well. rather then trying to understand where they started to take the wrong turns.. They just look at the numbers. so getting a reboot or sequel with a larger budget for better production may be out of the question. Because to them it is our fault it didn't do very well. We are the ones that didn't go see it or see it more than once so those numbers suggest that we just didn't want dragon ball on the big screen. It doesn't have anything to do with fox getting the driving factors behind the anime and manga right. They could have written a completely different and new story but keep the characters personalities and motivations intact and it would have still been dragonball. But they chose not to do that. The story was difficult to follow the main character was a completely different person personality-wise and the epic earth shattering action scenes that made the series were non existent."
xaviervictorlomas,My Quick review,7/10,3 September 2009,"i put this one dreading what i was going to be seeing after looking at the front cover but I was actually very surprised to come away liking this movie.The key to remember when you watch it is to remember the context of the movie. Remember that DB comic was aimed at children and not to teenagers, like Dragon Ball Z was, and you will not take it as seriously and there fore enjoy it more.This movie captures well, the feel and vibe of the DB world. The character are translated well from comic to film and were true to their comic book counterparts. The scenery was very well observed and yet made to look like they could exist. The direction took a lot from the comics and cartoons which greatly added to the experience.Sure they made mistakes but over all I thought it was OK. lots of nods to the comic that were left unspoken to those who know their stuff. Over all I think it was a very good effort, remembering the budget, and I hope they make another one which builds one what the film makers have achieved. making it darker and more DBZ perhaps to appease the fan boys.I've read some strange things that people have written on this film such as issues of race or that it didn't follow the comic story lines accurately enough. I don't think audience the film makers are aiming for will care on such issues and therefore neither should you (the audience). Again put the film into context; and remember it is after all just a light-hearted film."
Drkex1,Look beyond...,6/10,22 October 2009,"Before seeing this movie, take into consideration what was done with the new Star Trek movie. That being said, I looked at Dragonball Evolution as an almost alternate universe from the original anime. Yes, there are in fact some MAJOR differences from this movie and the anime; simply looking at anything at all in regards to this movie, the viewers can see that Goku is an adult in the movie, whereas in the anime he starts out as a child.When people go to the movies to see something that was originally a comic book, or a book, they need to EXPECT for there to be some changes. Look at Spiderman, in the TV show, the spider that bit him went through a radioactive beam and then found it's way to Parker. In the Spiderman movie (2002), the scientists changed the DNA of the spiders to genetically enhance them.The same has to be done for Dragonball: Evolution. The director probably knew that things would be different in the movie than how they were in the anime and in the manga. Yes, Goku's hair (as can be seen in the posters and whatnot) isn't exactly the same as it was, but how goofy would Justin have looked with that hair due? They wanted the whole thing to feel more NOW.I feel that they did that quite well. They wanted to introduce a new Goku, and they did it.When watching the movie, come out of the box a little and look at what they did. Not just how different it is; take into consideration the time, the audiences that would go and see it (Not all of the viewers would be super hardcore DB/DBZ/GT fans!), and the fact that they wanted to test to see how well it could be done.It's VERY hard to turn something that's been drawn for so long into real flesh and blood."
goyoychiqui,For kids,6/10,10 April 2009,"I have mix feeling about the movie. I went to the theater very open minded, and it worked. I mean, I actually enjoy most of the movie taking into account that this is not Dragonball Z but an adaptation to Dragonball, which turns to be more for small kids than grown ups. However I must say I was VERY disappointed with the final battle and specially with the Kame-Hame Ha. It wasn't exiting at all, instead was a very rushed ending and many loose endings (that will work like a charm if they make a good sequel).Justin Chatwin makes a funny Goku, which works for Dragonball (Evolution), however he will have to train REALLY hard as the sequels go by because his character grows up both body and mind while time goes by, so I hope he will be up to the task for the future. Mr. Chatwin, so far so good.I was kind of bumped about the fact that Piccolo is a very small part of the movie and that he don't really shows us the real menace he is. Instead his appearance is just for a few minutes and a very green Goku is able to defeat him without problems. Piccolo is a bad-ass, c'mon!!!!. You failed on this one. Not your fault though, Mr. Masters.The rest of the characters were OK. Bulma, Yamtcha and Roshi did a nice job working together.We really needed to see more intense training for Goku in the future films than the really lame air bending training that is showed on Evolution. We need to believe this youngster is going to defend us from Vegeta and the Sayians, so GET TO WORK, SCREEWRITERS!.By saying that I will give 6.5/10 points given the effort and the relative small budget (50 million) they had to spend.To the hardcore fans: The movie is appointed for little kids, so try not to fill the air with negative energy. It's OK for starters. I'm agree on something though: GO HOME JAMES WONG!!!!. This type of franchise (and specially for the story to come) needs a director with (dragon)balls. The Wachovsky maybe?. You decide."
vamosolimpo,One of the worse movies I've seen,1/10,16 January 2010,"This movie is a complete disaster. Along with Street Fighter is one of the worse movies I've seen in my whole life. I never watched a full episode of the original series, but I've seen parts of it. This movie destroy the series. How can it be so bad? Well, in my opinion, the director never watched the series either. I saw this film with some friends and we were laughing at it, though it's not a comedy. The special effects were lame and so the actors. If it had been take seriously, maybe it would really be a good movie to watch in DVD. This movie can be only watched during a day of winter, you are locked, only one channel is working on your TV and it's TNT. So, if you don't want to waste time of your life, please don't watch this!

joking91388,"Better than people are saying, I enjoyed it",6/10,11 April 2009,"This movie was actually pretty good, a lot better than I was lead to believe by the reviews on this site and others across the net. I will admit it could have definitely been better.A few details didn't line up with the original dragon ball anime but, there were a lot of things that hearken back to its origins which as a fan of the anime I appreciated. One must keep in mind that this movie is based on dragonball not dragonball z. I feel that the movie main story is very similar to the original story without just flat out reproducing it. And the effects are astoundingThe one major problem I have with it is that the fight scenes aren't long enough I say that if your a dragon ball fan you should see the movie and look forward to the sequels which are rumored to already be green lit."
lp_faint43,not as bad as i thought after reading many bad ratings,8/10,12 April 2009,"going in to this movie i was scared of what i might see being a huge DB and DBZ fan and have been for 10 years.after reading many many reviews of people saying how ""bad"" it was i cant help but wonder if they where expecting a exact replica of dragonball, this obviously can not be achieved and i can see why a few things where changed. the only two things i was not happy about was about the dragonball and how they where created, the other being about piccolo being the boss of the oozaru. but ofcorse im not going to be happy about everything that happens no matter what they do.this is a alternate take on dragonball, same general story told in a different way, thats my opinion anyway, goku is a bit different compared to the anime goku example would be how he trips over his words talking to chi-chi due to nervousness while the anime goku would never be nervous and talk to her like any other person he would meet.if you are a long time DB/DBZ fan go in to this movie open minded, try to accept the few changes made to suit this movie for a new audience and ignore these bad ratings and reviews don't let other people make up your mind about this movie. if you are new to DB then i hope you enjoy it i know i did even being a long time fan."
Raisondetout,Am I the Only One...,8/10,12 April 2009,"Am I the only one here who actually LOVED this movie?! Okay, I have watched this show ever since it came to TV. I have seen the Dragonball series at LEAST three times and Dragonballz at least 6. I know what I am talking about. Yes, I agree, it has some faults and some lame spots, but let's pretend we are the ages we were when the show came out. The effects would have been GREAT, we would not care about the acting or who was cast, we would have just thought it was FANTASTIC! Now, I am 21 years old and grew up with Dragonball mania. I admit, when the trailer came out I thought, oh my gosh, they modernized it and Justin Chatwin is Goku...oh no! I saw the movie tonight and LOVED it. I ignored the effect issues and the lame dialogue and character portrayal, but as I was mildly surprised at the differences in character, I LOVED the changes. Bulma, for instance was not whiney and a chicken, she was a kick ass chick. Chi Chi WAS too sappy for my taste and I like her DragonballZ character more. These are just a few examples, but I LOVED the movie, minus the Hollywood-ization HA!

moose_eod,Not as bad as you all say,6/10,13 April 2009,you know what. I was absolutely dreading watching this movie because of all the bad press and everyone on here slagging the movie off left me not expecting much - and you know what i thought it was pretty good. the fight scenes where well done if you ask me bar the final battle with picolo too many charge attacks not enough hand to hand combat and very short. something similar to goku and roshi's fight in house could of been used for fist fighting. also movie is now set up where we know some of the main players that if a sequel does come about it can actually move somewhere. so all and all thanx for the bad press made me enjoy it as my expectations where low.
paulcoffey2419,Fantastic Movie!,8/10,14 April 2009,"Okay. After seeing the movie on a whim with a friend and thinking it was a great movie. I came home to search other people's reaction online. I was COMPLETELY caught off guard by the reviews, rants, and total amount of money it made at the box office. I'm definitely not a Dragon Ball Z fanatic. I don't have action figures, cards, books, T-Shirts etc. I guess the phenomenon just swept right past me. But I have seen several episodes of the cartoon to understand the plot, the people and the basis of the show. So seeing the movie I wasn't completely lost. The special effects were amazing. The action scenes were pretty cool. And for the people that compared it to Spiderman Man and the fact that he was a loser before actually becoming Spiderman. Um no. Justin Chatwin, Goku. Was not a loser. Yes he got bullied, but he stated in the first 15 minutes of the movie that he was able to beat the bullies up. HIS GRANDFATER TOLD HIM NOT TO! So there is absolutely no comparison with him and Peter Parker. I can totally see how the fanatics of Dragon Ball Z can go crazy because the movie wasn't completely carbon copied from the cartoon, but when things are deemed, ""based on"", things tend to be a bit different. Tweaked if you will. It's actually saddening how this movie wasn't advertised as well as it should be. Instead of listening to rants from the cartoon viewers, people should take notice of the ""new"" viewers that this AWESOME movie has gained for it."
techieyumi,Otaku's everywhere will LOVE this movie!,10/10,15 April 2009,"Oh my goodness! I could not believe my luck when I saw they were making this movie. I nearly wet myself. I have followed this series since day one and I am a die hard Otaku. It was so like the anime. Word from word in some parts. The likeness of the characters were spot on. I would recommend this for generations to come as a overall anime/reality classic. It's even better than the anime. I don't want to tell you anything about the movie but I believe me, me and all my ho mies loved it. Goku is super hot. :) Just like the cartoon!!! I loved the love story they incorportated into it. It made me misty eyed. MUST GO SEE IT! 10000000000 stars!!!!!!

nathanwolff,It was alright,7/10,20 April 2009,"I went into the movie theater thinking this movie was going to be bad, but I actually kind of liked it. There was a few minor things that I didn't like about it, but I thought it actually represented the characters somewhat true to the series. I also think that the movie summed up the whole dragon ball series' story in about an hour and a half, but to be perfectly honest the story for dragon ball really doesn't make much sense either, but they did an okay job putting it on the big screen. I do have to admit that I probably wouldn't watch this movie again unless it just happened to be on t.v. and there was nothing better on, and I definitely would not buy the movie, but it is worth seeing at least once. All and all, I thought it was pretty entertaining.

empty_space,'kaa-me-haa-meh-haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa',8/10,26 April 2009,"Dragonball Evolution directed by James Wong may not have been a movie with the same scenarios of the series Dragonball, but it was a movie with different gist. As a child, I watched the series of Dragonball everyday and was very excited at the prospect that a movie was soon to be out. Seeing the posters of the movie however gave me little hope that this movie would turn out good. Not to get my hopes up on anything, I decided not to watch the trailer and thought it would be best if I waited for the movie to come out. I started watching the movie with no expectations, whatsoever. And as the movie began and proceeded, I recognised how things were different from the exciting episodes I watched as a child. The names of the characters remained the same, and so did some parts of the story. But then I realised a lot of it had to change, as for it was going to be 153 episodes in one 90 minute movie. Think about it, it will obviously be hard to summarise all those series into one small movie.I don't know why people are so angry and keep complaining about how bad it was. It was different but doesn't mean it was bad. I actually really enjoyed it, even though I have to admit I was dying to see some main parts of the episodes in that movie. Like the 'ka-me-ha-me-ha' scenes in Dragonball series went on for episodes and were so thrilling and unbelievable. However this was not shown in the movie with the same effects, but only went for few seconds and was somewhat completely different. Other than that, to my opinion, the movie wasn't so bad. It was just another version of 'Dragonball story', in a 90 minute shot, with a different gist!"
Crcivic,It's a Dragon Ball movie not Dragonball Z,7/10,29 April 2009,"OK so the Movie wasn't great but it wasn't that bad. I am a huge Dragon Ball, Dragonball Z, and Dragonball GT fan. I own and have watched every episode. I think that you first have to realize that this is a Dragon Ball movie not a Dragonball Z movie. Yes it's not exactly like the anime but did you really expect it to be. First there is no way the live action characters will look exactly like the anime they are real people not cartoons. Also as for the fighting, have any of you actually watched Dragon Ball it was very comedic in its fighting especially early on in the series. Dragon Ball was a long series and they tried to cram it into a single movie. There were some missing components in the movie and some changes. I think overall it wasn't that bad. I know I will buy it when it comes out on DVD. Also if they make a sequel I will watch it.

skater-47121,good in context,7/10,26 February 2015,"I see everyone smashing this movie yes it does not follow the anime to a key they took this movie and turned it into real life which to me live action is all about. they did a great job taking something totally impossible and spun it in a way that really could be true, don't hate the movie because it doesn't follow the anime. they did things in this movie that have been practiced for a very long time, you can harness your Ki and use it in ways similar to what they do in the movie not to the same extent, but it was trying to put a realistic spin on the dragonball series and that's what no one saw good movie and i have been a DBZ fan since the 90's

robert-ahles,Keeping an open mind,8/10,1 May 2009,"This movie exceeded my expectations completely. I never thought that they would be able to cram that much info into practically 80 minutes. They did a great job. Sure the script was a little bad and Yaumcha was kind of not we expected but it felt like a DragonBall movie. ~Spoiler~ Goku going to school and actually living somewhat of a normal life was a unique and gutsy approach to the intro of the movie but I think it fit nicely. Chi Chi still lived in a castle yet it looked like it was in the suburbs and Roshi lived in the city but at least it was something different.~/spoiler~Everyone who complains about how you should never see this movie should just not talk. Being closed minded really doesn't help and it really shows how ignorant people can be.Sure it may not follow the story at all, but its still a DragonBall movie no matter what. As I recall The Tree of might doesn't fit into the DragonBall plot either so let it go. Justin Chatwin was an amazing actor as Goku. I'm glad they chose him then say someone like Justin Timberlake or Jon Heder. He fits the profile well. Before I even watched the movie I told myself. Its not going to fit into the series so just keep an open mind. I did and I enjoyed it. I think the Final battle could have been longer but it was still very good. One thing I didn't like. The clothing for Goku. The pants for his uniform could have been tighter as they went down. -FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN IT- See it. Keep and open mind and enjoy the movie. Thats all I have. Thanks for reading my review, its my first one."
dan-burkard,This movie was good.,8/10,2 May 2009,"Just to start off, there might be spoilers in here (I think any good review would have a little spoilage)I read mmielnik4's review and thought this movie was really going to be just embarrassingly bad. I'm glad I didn't listen to him. The story is a little different, but wouldn't it have to be? Unless they plan on making 50 movies. You can see so many similarities in the show and the movie, but the movie tells it different. They have to put a level of realism to a live interpretation of the movie compared to a cartoon and I think they do that very well. Also they sprinkle in all kinds of little things to the movie to show you they know the story but they've got to package it up a bit. I was disappointed that it was so compacted. I wish they could have made the movie longer. Honestly I'm expecting these dragon ball z films to be 3 hours a piece. They could do it easy. I like the characters so far, even though there are some differences. Like Roshi being so young looking, but Chow Yun Fat just sells the role to me. He brings that wackiness the cartoon does without going unbelievable. The kid playing Goku if you watch him is ALWAYS making facial expressions that seem emphasized. Notice something? Go watch the cartoon and look at how Goku make faces in that. They captured it without it looking ""Hey SEE SEE like the show! like the show!"", in other words it brought the show to the movies without looking forced. Roshi when he announces himself as Roshi the invincible. Greatly done. I liked chi chi and Yamcha. More sprinkling, notice where she lives? It's a castle, her dad's the ox king who had a castle until Roshi Blows it up in trying to put out a big fire with a Kamehameha. I like Bulma too, though they changed her last name :-( I liked the running joke of there names being a little funny, ah well. Piccolo looks cool, different clothes and antennae pulled back it. His voice is different. I think it should go deeper, but I think when king piccolo dies and is reborn that could change. They may be saving that. Energy blast looks cool for there power levels. There going to look cooler as their power levels go up, I think there planning for the future. Seeing the battle at the end leaves me wanting more. They BETTER make more of these movies and make them longer, much longer. If you like the dragon-ball (sigh,imdb,sigh) series GO SEE THIS MOVIE, and then see it again. I liked it. Oh ya, I wish they put some of the music in the films. The music in both shows was cool. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
bigworm9001,Real Dragon Ball Fan Review 1,4/10,3 May 2009,"First of all before u continue to making comments about this movie ask your self why u even watched it, you all might have seen the previews to it that tells you mostly if a movie will s@$k or not. Every one should know by now all movies based on games and anime and comics will all ways be wrong when they make a movie. Example Wolverine Origins - in the previews with out watching the movie, gambit should be younger then cyclops and cyclops should not even be born when wolverine got the metal skeleton. The reason why wolverine got it was so he can hunt down the hulk read the comic not the new one that was created for the film the original one wolverine first came out in marvel in a hulk comic. This is knowledge not a spoiler watch the movie to see what i mean. Look first of all if you wanted to see Super Saiyans and other things from dragon ball z then don't watch. Its not dragon ball Z!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its Dragon ball!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! second of all from what i saw the story was off by a lot but was close, i wont spoil it for those that are true dragon ball fans know what i mean. The characters were OK the way the pro trade them was OK by major dragon ball fan standers.A major point is that Goku is an alien so if in any way he pro trade in a live action movie he can be any color race, but the movie makers decide to keep it like the manga and anime the race color white so no complaining why a British dude played him. This movie was suppose to be if it were real and there are a lot of details that they could not film like a little kid beating up adults and the training he went through, its to long and none realistic but they tried they messed up just even trying but they at least came up with something. The budget has nothing to do with it, It always ends with the writers. If you know what they wrote before they came to you and asked can we have money so we can make it of course people wont give any. But fans want it you get what you want, but its to late to complain. Remember Fox movies s$%k they ruin suppose to be good movies."
cenatista,A Flawed Masterpiece,10/10,8 April 2009,"The problem with this film is that it was too intelligent for its own good. I have watched every episode of Dragonball/Z/GT, and I consider myself a big fan, but the anime is mostly about fighting and I guess people wanted more action. While the film tried to be deep instead.People complain it wasn't like the anime, but you know what? If I want to watch something like the anime I will just watch the anime.The filmmakers did a good job of translating anime silliness into real life (e.g. capsule corp). Also remember they had very limited time with which to cram in so much, unlike anime which can take as long as it likes.Goku is superior to his anime counterpart because he is an emotional and empathetic character, unlike anime Goku who is dim witted and one dimensional. Movie Goku can be goofy too, but he can also be vulnerable and this is why I related more to him than Goku in the anime. This gives the film an emotional ""punch"" which the anime (for all its excitement) never has.Perfect? No. A few of the criticisms are correct. The film needed to be longer, especially in Piccolo's case. The villains were quite poorly executed.I look forward to the sequel, since we have already established most of the main characters that leaves more time to get on with the storyline.I give this one 9 (Thousaaaaaaaaaand!) out of 10 ;D"
jjsking0578,No awards but very watchable,7/10,25 May 2009,"I watched it as I enjoy the dragon ball cartoons and comics and thought it might be interesting, despite a lot of negative reviews etc but lets look at it for what it is. No its not going to light the acedamy on fire and it is not going to go down in history for deep plot and script writing. The movie is fun and when you think of the challenge of bringing manga comics/animation to live action thats a big task. I thought the realisation of the characters was good and the elements they have taken made for good story telling. There is life in the movie and the enevitable sequels can get better. I will most likely buy on release as it is something fun to watch on a slow weekend afternoon. If you want a martial arts epic watch Legend, Enter The Dragon or Hero, if you just want to sit back and be entertained this is not a bad choice.

ranchodelmaine,10/10 not sarcastic!,10/10,9 March 2015,"I love this movie, sounds like it's awesome! I wish it got a better review, but by me, it's a solid 10/10. To those who watched it, you're lucky. I only watched a 4th of it before my friend turned it off -_- But it's still the best. Just like The Last Airbender movie. Perfect.It doesn't follow the story of the anime or the manga much, which is kind of a minus, but it's a fine movie. I think they need to make a sequel, even though this movie was very, very underrated. As I said, could watch barely any of it before my ""friend"" just turned the movie off, but I might watch it again if he isn't around, so I can write a better review. But I REALLY, REALLY hope you people reading this don't hate me for loving the movie. End of review. Sorry it was short.

dark_blade-1,"Great in parts, some out of place but overall good :) loved it",7/10,3 November 2009,"Yes looking at previous comments on this i would agree, but if the film was done exact you would know what was coming next in every part of the film, but with this production it leaves you wondering, but the main points are there..., grapha gohan does die, goku meets chi chi and bulma, piccolo and the ouzaru thing maybe was a bit off but they can easy amend this film with a second bringing in the sayians and young gohan, this has got a lot of promise and people shouldn't be looking at a cartoon to match film, because do the batman cartoons match the movies no.., do the spider man cartoons match the movies noo, do the x-men cartoons match the movies no it doesn't so there's my point its a development of dragonball not an exact replica and knowing that one of the creators of the anime series are on the production team tells you to admire the adaptation of this great anime.

Bacup,WTF were they thinking,1/10,9 July 2009,"the director's job was easy compared to mine. All he had to do was make a good movie on a television show that was story that already existed in the television show. My job is to describe how terrible this movie is in 1000 words or less. To start how does Goku a man child in the television show who only cared about fighting, family, food, and fun turn into a whiny little emo punk? Piccilo not a bad casting choice should have gone with someone taller thats all. The Oozaru is a 50ft tall ape creature in the television series in the movie, its a werewolf dude like really.... I'm not even gonna put the rest of what is wrong with this movie into sentences to save time this is the last introduction you are getting: Master Roshi is a hermit he doesn't live in the city Goku meets Roshi when hes like 6 Bulma is supposed to be like 10 years older than Goku Goku never went to school Its pronounced Namek not Nemix Goku needs a tail or he can't change Piccilo is supposed to be an evil alien martial artist not a god damned sith lord Shenron is supposed to be huge not like 10ft Where is krillin... alright to conclude you took all the fun out of the series. And its going to be very hard for someone who actually understands the source material to gt the rights to make a good movie because this sh*t box film exists. Why god did you let this happen."
Hoshi-Kagayaki,Why?,1/10,12 July 2009,"I just don't get it. Dragon Ball has made millions of zenni all by itself.. from the manga to the animated t.v. show.. But, this movie directed by JAMES HONG (Remember that name.. cause he's a terrible terrible ignorant person) has almost.. nothing to do with Dragon Ball. I just don't get it. How could DB be sold out like this? HOOOOOW? WHHYY? My 8 month old daughter hated it. How can I tell that she hated it? She watched for a couple of minutes, looked at me and said ""Wow Dad, this movie is absolutely terrible, I'm going to remake this movie and bury James Wong with all the cash that WE made, compared to him. I wonder how many people killed themselves?"". FIRST FREAKING WORDS MAN!! I need to go to bed.. I'm very upset, these people.. DID THEY EVEN FREAKIN READ DRAGON BALL?!!?!?! James Wong, you are going to go to die one day and no one is ever going to wish you back with the dragon balls.. maybe just to torture you.. but yeah, YOU ARE TERRIBLE. The end. I HATE YOU!

adamlive-1,wow i cant believe it,8/10,20 August 2009,"what i don't understand is have you people even watched the series? I used to make everyone for and hour a day leave me the hell alone! i wasn't going to listen anyway. the series was based on b-rated acting for comical effect. master Roshi was a bit out of his mind and that's what makes him master Roshi. Goku was a bit shy and did stumble on himself and Bulma was always acting like a cross between 007 and Lara croft? I didn't like the portrayal of Yamcha though. He didn't have hair for one It seems to me that the people that were really into this movie took into account that this movie was based on a kids show and therefore understood the value of portraying the characters as they should. Kinda cheesy. And as for the martial arts, Goku wasn't supposed to be the master in DBZ! he hasn't even heard of going super-saiyen, or met Vegeta yet.. the character of master Roshi was in crouching tiger hidden dragon so i know he knew martial arts. why don't u watch an episode of the series then watch the movie and compare it then. I know you'll find a lot more similarities with a little refresher of the show. BTW Stephen Chow is frieken' awesome! shoalin soccer and kung-fu hustle and awesome!!! and yes Goku should have at least got a tan for the movie but in the series goku needed a tan also."

willlyboy_777,Yup they left out the little things too,1/10,13 April 2010,"Okay, i'm going to assume everyone saw it. So here's many problems that if fixed would have made the movie just a little better....but because there are these mistakes, it shows that whoever was making this movie either A. did not see Dragonball or Dragonballz or B. Wants to upset off fans of Dragon Ball and Dragon ball Z1. When Goku become the giant monkey....he's like 8 feet tall. The giant Monkey was like the size of a 8 story building, very different.2. they never explained who the Asian chick was or how she got there. (Piccolo's friend) that was just....so retarded I couldn't believe it. And why was he flying on that ship?....never mind...3.Master Roshi was not a pervert. In fact the only part that hinted that he liked girls was when there's a magazine with a girl on the front. I was hornier in the 4th grade. 4.Biggest letdown... when the eternal dragon comes out4A. when he is summoned the sky is as bright as day (supposed to be completely black)4B. When he leaves the dragon balls don't shoot off like they're supposed to4C. He's not awesome! He's the stupid gecko from the gecko commercials. He was....pretty much what the eternal dragon's junk was supposed to look like. It was unbelievable.I did understand the whole modern twist they were trying to put on it. But after a certain point it was way too unbelievably ridiculous. The movie could have been so much better."
dercar12,Completely Pitiful!,1/10,5 June 2010,"There's no way this director ever watched an episode of this cartoon. The actors were awful choices for the characters they played. Apparently Piccolo has the same powers as Darth Vader (Force Grip) Yamcha was pretty cool in the cartoon, this guy is possibly the biggest tool I have ever seen in my life! There is no possible way to make this movie any worse. I don't know whats more embarrassing, having a part in the creation of this movie or the fact that i have spent an hour and a half watching the whole thing. I kept watching in hopes of something happening to redeem it slightly but nothing happened. Hands down the worst interpretation imaginable of something great.

chris_kidwell,This film is truly awful!,1/10,18 May 2010,"I'm no film buff, I'm not great with actors and directors names, but as a child I was one crazy Dragonball fan. For this exact reason I completely put off the possibility of me ever watching this film, especially due to the westernised feel of the flick from the trailer. But as I switched through the film channels on Sky today, I saw it was on and decided to give it a go, ""what's the worst that could happen?"" I thought to myself. Whatever the 'worst' was, this was still worse.AUTHENTICITY: This film was in no way, shape or form authentic to the original series. There were many slip ups which were so aloof from the original manga and TV cartoon. Let me list off a few problems that I had with this movie. I've never, EVER, known a Kamehameha to be used as a healing tool. It doesn't matter what context you take it in, firing a Kamehameha blast into the chest someone that is near dead would finish them off, not jump start them. Next, why didn't Piccolo look like a Namekian? He was wearing some crazy matrix suit and didn't even have antennas. I could just about live with Bulma and Yamcha's characters, but the romance between them? Oh please... did the story/script writer even see or study the original manga characters before including that ridiculous notion? Also, Oozaru can only be achieved by Saiyans who still have their tail intact! I was literally face-palming when he transformed as I'd seen no evidence of a tail up until that point, and even if there was, it would still be wrong as Grandpa Goku removed his tail as a child! My last point (though there are more) is that Shenron was tiny! I've become used to seeing a huge dragon folded over and over itself, this one just looked too normal. And the wish? Come on, Goku from DBZ would never just wish for Master Roshi to be brought back to life, the wish would have been to revive everyone who was killed by Piccolo, including his Grandpa! But anyway, enough of this. I'm definitely coming across as a DBGeek now! PERFORMANCES: I'm not entirely sure of any of the actors as such, but from what I saw, only Bulma (Emmy Rossum) and Master Roshi (Yun-Fat Chow) really made any effort to act like their characters. But in all cases, the dialogue was often very awkward and very unbelievable. The fight scenes were short, underwhelming and very unlike what DB fans have been treated to through the TV cartoons. The whole thing just shouted out 'Power Rangers' to me. Not a good look.EFFECTS: Glass half full, glass half full...*breathe*...I liked the look of the dragonballs... and the whole 'Transformer' thing with Bulma's vehicles... But the CGI landscapes looked so so fake, and the Ki blasts just didn't have that Dragonball feel. I don't want to say that the special effects were complete balls, but they just weren't right for Dragonball.OVERALL: The film overall is a huge flop. James Wong really has butchered a great series. I'm not quite sure who they were marketing this movie at. If it was to the DB fans, it's useless as it doesn't look or feel like DB, plus all of the glaring mistakes. If it's to the people who aren't DB fans, it's also useless. Why would someone who isn't a fan of the series want to watch a live film of a cartoon they didn't like or watch? Basically this film could only have been marketed at people who had never heard of Dragonball, and I don't think that is a very big market. In the future, if someone ever makes a real-life Dragonball movie again, I really hope that they do their homework on the series, cast the right actors, and get the effects right. Whoever gets this right, could have a good 5 to 8 successful 2-3 hour movies! Dragonball doesn't need to be westernised, we love it as it is!"
jhalbithedragon,"Absolutely Horrific, Complete Garbage",1/10,7 June 2010,"If my grandmother, Hitler and Adam Sandler got together to make a Dragonball movie, it would be miles above this piece of human feces. To call the acting sub-par would be a great compliment to every actor involved in this thing. The special effects appeared to have been done by someone who had no idea what they were doing and had never seen a movie before. The dialogue was written by someone who had no knowledge of human conversation and had the literary skills of a golden retriever. Seriously, as a child and even very recently I have watched and enjoyed the anime Dragonball and Dragonball Z, and this movie took a giant dump on my childhood memories. If you like Dragonball at all DO NOT SEE THIS. You will regret every second that you sit through this giant waste of time. james wong should never make a movie again, hell he doesn't even deserve the capitalization of his name. I have no idea why this project wasn't immediately pulled and every copy destroyed. Almost every single part of this movie was simply horrific. I was extremely aggravated by simply watching the movie, just the act of watching it made me want to destroy my television. Please, never forget this moment in cinema history; Those that forget history are doomed to repeat it."
legendgamer,Dragonball Evolution - Whats is everyone on about?,7/10,29 June 2010,"Director: James Wong Actors: Justin Chatwin, Yun-Fat Chow, Emmy Rossum, James MarstersCharacters: Goku(Justin), Roshi(Yun-Fat), Bulma(Emmy),Piccolo(James)Genre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Comedy Feature Length: 100 minutesRated: PG (Mild Action Violence, Infrequent Coarse Language)This movie was a modern version of the original Drangonball series revised into a 100 minute film. Director James Wong who also directed other hit movies for example, Final Destination, Final Destination 3, The One etc, did an amazing job in recreating the Dragonball story, while featuring well-preformed actors, like Justin Chatwin (Goku) who also plays as Robbie in War of the Worlds and Nick Powell in The Invisible. Emmy Rossum (Bulma) who also played as Christine Daaé in The Phantom Of The Opera, and Laura Chapman in The Day After Tomorrow.Although this movie was not exactly like the original manga storyline, it does not mean it is a let down. This new modern story was an interesting change for the original. Instead of Goku being being a dumb nut, he attended school. Instead of Goku being a little 12-15 year old immature child, he was an 18 years old, and more mature. Because the focus audience is still for children/teens, it focuses on modern problems in children/teen life, one is the bully problem at schools, Goku was not a well loved student in the film, but rather one of the victims of bullying. It also shows teenage love, like how they are shy to start of with but gain confidence throughout the story. Dragonball Evolution relates to the audience more then the original story.The Fight scenes were a combination of The Matrix and The One, which is quite a good mix, and is worth seeing. The effects were well done. It was still funny and silly like the series. While relating the series to modern time.Overall the movie was great, and worth watching. The Fighting is great, the relation from the movie to the audience was well done, it was funny and the cast was perfect. I would suggest this movie to people that are into Dragonball, that would not mind a change in the original story."
tommyxenglish,"Hardcore DBZ Fan since birth, RUINED Legacy",1/10,13 July 2010,"I've been watching DB-DBZGT since it came out. Plus all the separate movies, Bardocks movie, Cooler. Watching this movie all I could say is, Your kidding me right. You take a popular series like this which has good morals and a brilliant story line and have the nerve to spit face it? For god sakes they even made Star Treck a good movie, Transformers is raping the box office and even Harry Potter is doing well. This plot is 10 times better then either of those story lines. What upsets me the most is that this could be the last time a great idea like this is executed. I pray that this film is redone with a commendable approach and time is taken and that the storyline is followed. Respect the FANS give them what they expect, not a vampire slayer Piccillo. For Christ sake he's dressed like Blade himself. At least follow the standard (Characters actually looking like the ones there supposed to portray as well as outfit. Roshi looked NOTHING like the real version, no bear turtle shell ext. Bulma has blue hair, no Chi Chi is not Vietnamese nor is Goku a redneck hillbilly. Since when does Yamcha have mustard hair and since when is a full Korean man. He looks like Goku for the most part. Just a straight slap in the face to all fans hoping that the series would live on after Akira Toriyama pulled the plug and sliced our hearts out. I'd give anything for the series to be brought back so at LEAST respect the storyline......... And wait, Kamahameha revival? Money transformations with NO tail? Get real"
calverleybm,If I could give this lower than a 1 I would,1/10,20 July 2010,"I knew this movie was gonna suck the moment i saw Goku played by the whitest guy in existence. However, I watched it later on an airplane cause it was free and i had nothing else to do. They pretty much ruined the whole series. Why they tried to make it modern with Goku being some nerd in high school, I will never know. I thought some parts of the movie were pretty hilarious because of how poorly this movie was made. The only thing I actually like about the movie was Jamie Chung (chi chi) because she's pretty cute. Other than that, this is a garbage movie and I pray to god that there is never a sequel to this piece of trash.

Kasper10779,Thoroughly Enjoyed This Movie,10/10,11 April 2009,"Sadly, I can see this is being slammed by either DB haters, or fanboys, who cannot look outside of the box and view this as another aspect into the DB world. I was lucky enough that I did not listen to the comments here and elsewhere to determine whether or not I saw this movie. First, this is not the series, and no it does not follow the zillions of story lines that have come about through the years. Even the anime movies did not truly follow the series storyline.Those who are arguing about the race of the characters apparently haven't watched the show. Let me pull my nerdy card out for you and state that Goku is a Saiyan, and their king was a cat if I need to get anymore specific. The cartoon was drawn with a mixed array of people and creatures.We start of with a teenage Goku, living with his grandfather Gohan, still learning the ropes about who and what he is. Yes, the series has him as a child, but this is not the series.I feel the acting is great, and to keep the movie kid-friendly, Roshi is tamed down, but Chow Yun-Fat takes the role and gives a great vibe as the Master. Joon Park is exceptional as Yamcha and reminds me much of the character in the series, minus a furry little friend, and Bulma is a know-it-all techie. As for Marsters, I feel he did an excellent job as King Piccolo, and the make-up was a good interpretation without making the character completely cheesy.The action is great, and again the interpretations of the Kamehameha wave, as well as other energy balls was great without making them totally over the top cheesy. I could argue that Goku's change needs some work, but that is something that can be tweaked if we get future movies.My advice is to see this movie with open eyes, and forget what you know about the series. It is pretty safe for the kids; minor swearing, no nudity, and while there is violence it isn't overly scary."
efstathia-917-835782,I think I just had a strike... absolutely awful,1/10,7 December 2010,"This movie is ridiculous to say the least! Being a massive Dragon Ball Z fan, this movie got me so angry within the first 30 minutes of watching it.I am so ashamed, Please if you intend to watch this Don't!this got me so angry and i want to spit in the directors faces. they no doubt even watched the series or read it. All they did was get the characters names, throw in the dragon balls and thats it.They should be sued for putting such a brilliant manage/anime to disgrace.The actors were pathetic and didn't even play the characters right. All in all, this movie was nothing like the series and it makes me sick seeing these actors in future films to come."
djklymaxx,"Use ""The Last Airbender"" As an example. PLEASE READ!",1/10,20 January 2011,"This Movie was complete garbage and disrespect to all fans of Dragonball/z/gt. I don't even want to think how disappointed and/or suicidal Akira Toriyama is (lol). This is an atrocious adaptation of the Dragonball series that i grew up watching, but let me cut to the chase: The only thing accurate in this movie is the Dragon balls and the Names of the characters. The reason I am saying to use 'The Last Airbender' as an example is because, when I watched The Last Airbender, it was basically a complete transformation from cartoon animation to real life movie, plain and simple. And when i went to watch this movie, i was kind of thinking that they would have done that same thing. Many fans who grew up watching almost every episode of Akira Toriyama's masterpiece always wondered what it would be like if the cartoon were actually real, I honestly have, and this is not AT ALL what i thought it would be. I would rather watch a power ranger movie than this Garbage. I honestly think if the producers and director were to take a more in depth look at the cartoon/anime itself, then they will honestly see where they went wrong, in EVERYTHING. What happened to the barren wastelands and out of this world landscapes that we are used to seeing Goku and others fight and experience adventures on ? What happened to the clothes that they wore etc. Where is the little island in the middle of sea where Master Roshi's house is built on ? Where the hell did this modern futuristic crap come from? When the hell was Goku in high school going to parties? We all know that when Goku came to earth, he was on a mission, he even had a tail! I understand that he was a teenager in this movie but come on, at that age/time, Goku was kick'n a$$!! And now Im hearing that there will be a sequel to this crap? Come on i ain't wasting my $ on it unless they were to do the whole thing over again while paying attention to the story, detail, scenery, action, adventure and so on. *M. Night Shyamalan (or someone thats affiliated with him) please try to get on this project or consider doing this whole thing over. Shyamalan is the only person I can see paying attention to the story and putting that 30 mill or more if needed to GOOD use. The last thing i want is my childhood in the DB series to be wasted on a STUPID, SENSELESS movie that is SUPPOSED to be 10 times or more better! *Warning: Those who know nothing about the DB series. Please don't watch this movie, and if you already have i am so sorry that you watched this crap, because it is not the Dragon Ball i know."
leyo-bottinger,Read the review,4/10,30 August 2011,"The only good thing about this movie is the Kamehameha and awesome technology. Otherwise Goku's acting was terrible.And even if this movie would be like a prequel to Dragon Ball Z. They should make a sequel to this movie where Goku became epic. They recruited Piccolo, Tien and Krillin. Gohan is born and Vegeta finally arrives on the scene and that Hollywood can finally find out what a Saiyan is. Oh yeah did I mention the fight scenes were terrible. Fights were too short and I wanted them to more epic. Well if you would even take the time to make a sequel and market it during Dragon Ball Z Kai or during shows with viewers who even know what a Dragon Ball is well then sure life would be great.

fredandthebear,awful,1/10,10 July 2011,"How anyone, fan or complete newcomer, could see this and enjoy it or even give it as high as three stars is beyond me. This sort of drivel should be discouraged by everyone, I implore you to burn every copy you find. Extreme? NO BURN IT. Yet again Hollywood has managed to grasp a decent concept, then suck out all its innards and compose a film with its deflated skin, perhaps we should destroy everything that's good, keep some photos, so that the morons with millions can't get their hands on it. NO Goku doesn't go to some cheesy typical American 'high school', he doesn't get bullied and he certainly doesn't have fights at parties with jocks. Mr Wong, I'm assuming, must be a big fan; 'wtf's going on with this?' I pondered as the film dribbled by, there is almost no resemblance in any of the elements of the film, I know I know its someone else's idea of Dragon Ball but Jesus Christ just don't call it Dragon Ball, that way you don't get the fans using your DVD as Frisbee's and you can keep the 12 year old's you've fooled and convince them to buy the lunch box.Rant over, i just mainly didn't understand why Hollywood feels the need to Americanise absolutely everything, I heard they planned to make a feature film of the classic AKIRA...in New York? WTF. 1. not everyone lives in America 2. if you do, if you go to see a film like Dragon Ball, why would u want it to be in America? 3. Hollywood needs to die, its time"
bmmaynard87,This actually makes me quite angry.,1/10,1 December 2011,"The thing that pisses me off is not the fact the the movie itself sucks. I mean, seriously. You could not have possibly expected otherwise. The thing that pisses me off the most is the fact that a person like me will spend weeks/months pouring his/her soul into a script, only to send it to Hollywood and have it thrown into the very pile of ""junk"" that should have been the final resting place for this flaming pile of human feces. Not saying that my work is the best out there. But I do know 2 things: 1. a film made from one of my screenplays would not exclusively have negative reviews on IMDb.com (EVEN if it were an adaptation); 2. my screenplay would not insult an entire nation of people, not to mention millions of others in other nations. I'm sure the same thing goes for most other aspiring writers out there.EVERYONE who was involved in the making of this ""film"" should really look back on it as the low point of his/her career, and use it as an example of what NOT to do. Can't possibly find a better example than this one."
mattnetking,"Dragonball Evolutions utterly destroyed my favorite cartoon, and I loved every moment of it.",2/10,12 April 2009,"Let me start out by saying that I may be one of the biggest Dragonball/Dragonball Z fans of all time. I can remember getting off the bus every day and excitedly waiting for the next episode of Dragonball.Whenever I wasn't watching the series, I was buying up the newest movies, collecting dozens and dozens of action figures, playing that stupid card game, drawing pictures, and absorbing as much ""Dragonball Knowledge"" as I possibly could.Dragonball is, in my opinion, the greatest animated work ever. It is a fantastic cartoon series that is so gripping and intense that I enjoy watching it to this day.With that being said, you can imagine my excitement when I first read in a Beckett Dragonball Z magazine that Fox had acquired the rights to make a live action Dragonball Z movie. Fast forward five or so years later, and we have Dragonball Evolution. The film I had been waiting for since adolescence.I was skeptical, of course, how could they possibly transition my childhood icons to the big screen? How could they script such a rich and interesting story? But, I assured myself they couldn't screw it up too bad.Then I saw the trailer.As I watched the last remnants of my childhood die, I completely dropped all standards for this movie and simply saw it for fun.If you go into this film expecting Dragonball, you will be sorely disappointed.It is a sad parody of Akira Toriyama's epic. There are literally innumerable inconsistencies with Dragonball Evolution and the Dragonball series. Goku has no tail? Piccolo has some estranged unexplained female lackey? Goku went to high school? Seven mystics made the Dragonballs? I could go on and on.But, if you go expecting a good time, you will have one. Although the story is so thin it's almost absent, I loved every second of its wacky charm. This film felt like a high budget ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch with all its clichés and absurdities making it downright hilarious. I often found myself uncontrollably laughing.It is literally the funniest films I have seen in quite a long time, and with society's current state laughter is becoming rare. So I accept it, even though the ending makes no sense, the characters are as thick as blocks, and the writing is cringe-worthy.And for those of you with kids, they'll love it. It's brainless action with quirky characters, explosions, and kung-fu. Although be warned, some of the women's shirt cut-lines are *ahem* less than conservative, but no nudity is visible.Don't expect this to be Dragonball Z or even Dragonball, it's not. It's no where near such levels of excellence. But that's okay.I had a genuinely good time viewing this mediocre work of art, and I will probably watch it again in the future. I honestly adore this awful movie and its poor attempt to recreate my favorite childhood show.And if you go into it with an upbeat attitude, you will too.6.5/10"
jeronimo-chamorro,"Oh Hollywood, you do it again",3/10,4 March 2012,"Is a clear example of what happens when a project without ideas a lot of money is put. For someone who watched the anime is insulting what they did with the story until the time comes that it is impossible finish the movie. For those who have not seen the anime, is a remix of teen movie, ill- conceived adventure, heroes and villains unconvincing underdeveloped. A watchable movie for children under 12, but if necessary it is better to make them see the original anime before this shame. I could write endless tube faults the movie, not only in history (that's the worst that can happen to a fan of Dragon Ball), but the script also poorly developed, the actions run down and address unintelligible, but it would be a waste of time. It is best to pretend that the movie never existed.

bobsnowboarder99,You should watch grass grow to save yourself the time wasted watching this movie,1/10,17 October 2012,"Nothing in this movie was enjoyable,acting was horrific, writing was horrific, it's almost like they have never watched a single episode of Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z. None of the characters were anywhere close to what they were in the show. Goku wasn't a cocky a-hole. Bulma barely ever fought, and she sure as hell was never in a serious fight. Piccolo was a lone wolf type of character so the fact he had followers is just absurd. Goku grandpa died when he was very young, not when he was 18. Roshi was an up beat kind of guy, not a metaphorically speaking boring old guy. Yamcha was pretty obnoxious on the show, but not that bad, probably the most accurately betrayed personality. But he was also a good fighter so him being completely useless was stupid. The kameamea wave was much more simple, not a bunch of complex hand movements that make him look stupid. Oh and body's don't float in lava. Overall just a terrible movie, definitely the most disappointed I have ever been by a single movie in my life, and I saw Indiana Jones 4 so that's saying something. My least favorite movie of all time, I would rather watch Son of the Mask 10 times in a row than watch this movie."
abdelbouchiba,Two Words : Epic Fail. Spoiler Alert,1/10,23 July 2012,"Terrible... instead of wasting those millions of dollars in producing a failure, give it to charity. Or give it to me... I'll bet I can do better.I mean the director did Kung Fu Hustle and that was really a good movie. And then this? The story has totally been changed. Goku never went to school, he was a little boy from the forest surviving on his own. His grandpa was killed years before his 12th birthday. Master Roshi has to look more wise and pervert at the same time (see the manga) the one in the movie is a disappointment.I would advise the people to read the manga or watch the anime for the moment. Probably wait until that someone would make a proper adaptation. because this one is an error. Don't waste your time, trust me on this one"
Red-Haired_Shanks,This movie gave me cancer,1/10,26 November 2013,"Without a doubt one of, if not the worst movie I have ever seen. Whoever made this should be ashamed. Please do yourself a favour and never watch this ever. Don't even mention it. It doesn't deserve that. The acting is so bad, its not even funny. The characters are so far away from the original you would have trouble thinking this is even dragon ball. The plot. Oh the plot. Well it doesn't make sense at all. There is nothing from the anime or the manga that resembles this. The dragonballs were created by 7 mystics? Um no. Goku goes to school? No. Goku fights piccolo as a teenager? Not the first time. Goku is in love with chichi? He didn't even know about girls until after his gramps died of natural causes. There is just too much wrong with this movie. I don't usually review movies but this was just so unbelievably bad I had to vent.

frannasvdw,A great betrayal,1/10,23 February 2014,"We knew it before it even came out. That it wasn't going to be the same as the original series. It couldn't be. The story would be changed to fit into 2 hours available and so some things would have to go and plots would have to be simplified. This movie does suck on every level but if it would have been only a matter of poor overall quality then it wouldn't have been a big deal. Hate it and move on!I feel though the makers didn't stop just there. They betrayed the whole spirit of the Dragonball saga. Goku's key characteristics aren't his strength, hair or lineage as much as his personality. A sweet, confident, feisty boy who is unshakable in the clarity and simplicity of his convictions. A little wild man who's free from the pressures to fit in. This movie's Goku is NOTHING like the Goku we all know and love. He is the same archetype used in all fantasy movies involving an adolescent. Being special but for some reason hating it just wanting to fit in, blah blah blah. Goku's personality is THE most important part in Dragonball and the makers just threw it all away. They could've had a unique character for a change but instead they settled for mediocre. Maybe it's a good thing that the screw up was utterly so, so that when somebody with the stones to do this properly finally comes along it can be fresh fresh for western viewers"
tincup5000,Hilarious,8/10,12 April 2009,"We went out to watch this film last night and all highly enjoyed it. It is fairly well paced with pretty good action scenes, hilarious dialogue, and only an hour and 10 minutes. Many of the complaints about the film seem to stem from people not realizing exactly what this film is trying to be. Although I've never seen the cartoon, this movie is a perhaps tamed down version of what I imagine the cartoon being like. My friends mentioned how in the cartoon somebody would be charging an energy ball for a 2 or 3 episodes before anything would happen, well that fortunately doesn't happen in this film, but the dialogue, sets, and social situations are all reminiscent of a early 90s cartoon. Take for instance GI Joe. If somebody took the script of one of the episodes and filmed in in live action, the result would probably score a 2/10 on IMDb. The voices and dialogue of many (especially Japanese) cartoons, while great in their own right, don't really work in a live action setting. What this film did is essentially use a cartoon script and put it on film, leading to a charmingly hilarious kids movie. Somebody previously wrote on here that this film seems as if it were written by an 8 year old, well, yeah but that's what makes it great! If I were 8 years old, I can imagine loving this film. As a 22 year old watching it was perhaps the most enjoyable theater experience I've yet had. So my recommendation: grab some alcohol, sneak it into the theater, and get ready for a wonderful time."
Mascy,Don't watch this.,2/10,1 August 2013,"We all love the idea of a 'real' Dragonball movie but don't waste your time watching this. After ages of postponing due to the incredible bad ratings i finally came around to watching this but i wish i hadn't. The acting is bad, the special effects are mediocre at best and the story being told is plain boring.The girl playing Bulma is cute and she's probably the reason i finished watching this horrible movie. She's also the only one that seems to have paid attention in acting school because the Goku character made me cringe 2minutes in with the horrific showcase.Don't watch this, watch a couple Anime episodes instead or look up the girl that played Bulma and watch one of her movies. I'll guarantee you that either will enjoy you more.

avengedsevenfold-93,"Enjoyable, but not all that good...",3/10,8 September 2012,"As a big fan of Dragonball, I can't really say that much good about this movie. The actors weren't all that suited for their roles; don't get me wrong, i like Justin Chatwin, but i don't think he was the best choice for Goku. If he was more muscled, then maybe. It would perhaps have helped if he was wearing a wig, but then again that might have looked awful as well.Joon Park did not fit being Yamcha AT ALL. He looks like some surfer dude that would fit in on a beach, not in a Dragonball movie. It is nit picking, but hey! Yamcha is supposed to have long black hair, and what about Puar? That shape shifting cat is always with Yamcha... Emmy Rossum as Bulma...She did a fairly decent job, but again; Bulma has blue/turquoise hair, not brown with blue highlights. And Piccolo looked good, surprisingly enough. Again, if you are a Dragonball fan, you'll see that there is a lot of things that doesn't fit in; Goku never went to school, much less a high school with bullies. Goku and Bulma met out in the wilderness; Yamcha is supposed to look tough and not at all like a surf dude and he has a cat companion; Master Roshi is supposed to look much older and he is supped so live on a remote island and he wears a big turtle shell on his back; Goku is supposed to turn into a giant ape - not..whatever it was he turned into...Like i said, there are some flaws. However, if you have NEVER watched or read DB before, then it might have been more enjoyable. It was a good try, but it didn't quite do it for me. There are things that could have been done differently and better, but i give it a 4/10. I did enjoy watching it, but whilst i watched it, i was just thinking about all the differences and changes. To be honest, ""Dragonball: The magic begins"", which was made in the early 90's, was a lot better considering they actually made the actors look like the characters (ie. Master Roshi is bald and wears a turtle shell on his back).Conclusion: A good try, but it didn't quite cut it. 4/10"
dfavatar,"10 years later, I had to show my teens",1/10,26 December 2021,"This movie was so hilariously bad the first time, I just had to show my teenagers. It was fun to pause and recap on inconsistencies and how terrible the storyline was. Still a solid 1.0 rating 10 years later. Lastly, the after credits was like ""Oh yeah, gonna have a sequel."" LOL!! Thanks for not pushing out another one. Goku is a minion of Piccolo?! Hahaha."

iabdolali,God... Dammit...,1/10,6 March 2013,"Oh boy, Dragon Ball Evolution.... Now I have been a fan ever since I was little. I've watched every single episode at least 3 times and I have to say that this was like taking those memories and dumping a pile of dung on them. Now, I can normally handle a terrible movie but this? This was a disgrace in every regard. It had no similarities with the series, the actors were awful in every way! And the scripting was enough to blow a persons brains out. Alright calm down, let me say the specifics of this movie that make me want to gouge my eyes out. Goku. The actor not only didn't sound or look anywhere near him (and yes I know that Goku's a animated character but still!)! Second of all, he's in high school... HE'S IN BLOODY HIGH SCHOOL! Fans of the series will know how dumb that is. Bulma... No blue hair = NO BULMA! Great Ape Goku? This is enough to kill me. Great apes are supposed to be absolutely huge! As big as a skyscraper! Their Goku was hardly grew a foot! Now don't get me started on King Piccolo! Absolute worst of them all! By acting and by appearance he was a disgrace. Phew. That's enough. I could go on but I might put my head through a wall..."
Vpirate25-646-453795,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.,1/10,29 March 2013,"This franchise has so much potential in the live-action scene. In Dragonball Evolution, Goku is 18 and a high school/college student. This movie is mostly the Roshi training/King Piccolo arcs mashed together, which is fine, the whole of Dragonball condensed into one movie. The pacing through the series was great and really the only thing good about this movie. Seeing as they had these two arcs, and Goku was 15 when he fought Piccolo, why didn't they just set Goku at 15? It would be an acceptable change, would it not? And why did they put him in school? To make him seem normal? There's the thing, Goku is anything BUT normal and never had a day of formal education in his life. THAT, was some bullshit. Also, where was Krillin? Krillin was a major character in the series.Had it not been based on Dragonball, it would be a mediocre movie. But it ruined one of the most well-loved franchises in history, and that makes it one of the worst movies of all time."
sephirothspawn,anyone who has a problem with this movie,10/10,12 April 2009,"can not call themselves dragon ball fans cause if u paid any attention akira had say in this movie and he said it was his new imagining so get over it cause it was a great movie and i hope they do make more ill watch em and buy them all to add to all my db dbz and dbgt dvds so everyone needs to stop being so critical about it cause your never going to get a perfect adaptation of any game, movie, or book so accept it as it is go in seeing it as a new beginning to a wonderful series and enjoy it and i bet you will see it for the great movie it is then what you think it should be if you want your movie buy a video camera and try making one better then this movie

getbj0235,A butchered Insult.,1/10,26 November 2013,"I love the Anime series but I am not an obsessive fan boy. So when I finally worked up the courage to watch this movie last week with my best friend who like my self loved it in his teens and still loves the show. A couple of drinks and some chips we were set we had heard horrible things about this movie but kept an open mind considering the title was after all DragonBall Evolution.From the opening title I knew there was something wrong. That feeling I had with Star Wars Episode 1. After the opening monologue we are introduced to Goku, although it feels like an impostor. Goku is the first major issue with this abomination of film. Within the first ten minutes of the film the Character is destroyed and spat on and tossed aside. Justin Chatwin was wrongfully cast (not meaning to sound racist but it should have being someone at least half Japanese)Goku in this movie is not evolved he is butchered into a winging little brat who cry's about his girl problems at the high school he attends and not to mention the bullies. Goku has bullies let that sink in for a moment. But where Goku is really butchered and not evolved ""I can tear them apart with one hand"" that line alone is a complete spit on the series. Goku in the series was a loving and caring boy who only fought when needed never used violent threats or thoughts. As for the rest of the cast Bulma sucks the most followed close by Roshi next up is Yumcha. Piccolo seemed to be the only one done somewhat true to form while being evolved, however is quickly demolished by the fact the idiotic story surrounding himself and Goku being alien races who took over earth. So they got it somewhat right but they managed to make it look like worst then a power rangers movie. If your going to evolve a series and a story probably best to not go to far from the source material. I will say however it seemed like they had a good idea for an evolved story. but some how they butchered and not evolved some of the most loved characters of both Anime and Action Cartoons."
matt_bird15,Laughable,3/10,16 February 2014,"So, you guys want a mini review of the movie?It was laughable. The CGI was ""meh"" at best, the fight scenes were choreographed decently, and the acting was pretty bad. Worst movie ever though? No no, Manos is still the worst in my opinion, but this movie is pretty horrible. The actor they used to play Goku was probably fresh out of acting school, and I'd say he didn't learn very much. Roshi isn't an old pervert, there's no Krillin or Tien, and Shenlong was just...not right. Very very unreliable to the manga/anime. 3/10If you like bad movies and you're a fan of Dragonball, give it a watch. Prepare to laugh your ass off."
Jay_4,"Better than expected, some annoying change",4/10,10 April 2009,"I had really low expectations for this so I was satisfied that it didn't totally suck.I knew it was going to be a bit of a contemporary spin on DB, like the lack of animals and Goku's being more of a typical person and I was cool with that.Well cast movie, Chow Yun-Fat as Roshi and especially the actor playing Yamcha we're very close to character. A lot of the elements of DB are retained in some way, the humour, Roshi's less than chivalrous moments and the somewhat corny yet essential dialogue so those are pluses.Effects were decent, fight scenes were solid and it could have been a lot worse. Took me a few minutes to settle in and not look at it too objectively. If that was the first I've heard of DB it would have been fine but it's not a sterling representation of Dragonball on the whole."
fernando-santos-923-282334,Really disappointing,1/10,13 February 2014,"The movie its really bad, the idea was good. Its a shame of all Dragon ball Z fans. It would be so nice if someone make a proper movie of Dragon Ball Z, with effects of Man of Steel/Avengers/The Last Airbender/Matrix/Lord of the Rings/etc... it shouldn't be that hard since every decent action movie has acceptable effects, its not even possible to take this movie serious. I guess all the fans of the Dragon ball Z saga will have a long wait for someone to make a decent movie, its the kind of movies its not even worth the time to watch online or something, maybe only for support issues, I've watched on cinema and was really a waste.

Dazcha,Passable for an action film,7/10,25 April 2009,"The director of a live-action adaptation of an animated TV show is truly caught between a rock and a hard place. Animation is a very different medium to live-action film, and many things that one can animate do not translate well to reality. Consequently, when creating live-action adaptations, story lines are heavily modified, leaving die-hard fans of the source material equally as resentful as they would have been if the director produced a half-hearted clone of the original.I saw Dragonball Evolution with this premise in mind. I was not expecting an exact clone of Dragonball (or even a decent movie, for that matter). I left feeling rather satisfied. It strikes me that the director kept what needed to be kept to keep some loose continuity with the canon, and changed enough to make an original, if not enjoyable, action film.The plot follows Goku (an eighteen-year-old high school student and martial arts prodigy) as he tries to collect the Dragonballs to avoid Piccolo (an evil green dude) from using them to destroy the world. It's the basic premise of the Dragonball franchise. Minor details were changed - particularly in the back story - but the premise is still there. Justin Chatwin is absolutely adorable as Goku, adapted from being a 12-year-old nitwit to a teen-aged dork. Putting a genuine romance between Goku and Chichi (as opposed to the anime/manga's horrid forced marriage concept) was a welcome addition.My one criticism of this movie would be its length. Another 20 minutes and the script could have provided more character development or elaborated on the back story. All in all, it was a decent adaptation and a passable standalone action film."
maxitaxi-214-207742,Tries to ruin your childhood,1/10,4 June 2016,"Let's just put it that way. If you like (or love) Dragonball and even more Dragonball Z, you will hate this movie. It messes with everything you like. They made an awkward version of a teen's movie with elements of Dragonball in the style of the Last Airbender (but that movie is a thing by itself). The animations are bad, the story is bad, the characters are bad, the jokes are bad, the references are bad. They ripped the original apart. Maybe a spoiler because you never thought it would be that bad.Don't need to say more, because maybe I would get into rage mode too much. Advice: Stay with the Anime. Don't try to make good movies with real actors out of our favorite childhood shows.Such a thing will not happen."
g-luiijf,All wrong,1/10,22 January 2016,"Lame female dogs at IMDb won't let me use profanities, but the only reason this movie gets such a high rating is because of people who do not know and love the Dragon Ball saga like we do. Had to vote 1 because there is no lower number than that. Personally I'd vote it a minus 10. Everything is wrong that can be wrong. From how the impersonations look to how they react and meet. It should never have come to film. This movie is a profanity in and of itself. Like to get angry? Watch it. Otherwise, don't. Need ten lines minimum, so lets review some more. Goku's blond and basically human for starters. And he's going to school! He's never been to any school until he tries for his driver's license, decades after his grandfather dies. He grew up in the wilderness with only his grandfather Gohan to guide him. There isn't a shred of truth to this movie and they'll probably bar me from posting this, but I needed to vent some of my anger at least...

Anybody, and i mean ANYBODY who appreciated dragon ball despises this movie. and for good reason too. its terrible. The characters are not anything like the show, vital things about everyone were changed, AND BULMA'S HAIR WASN'T EVEN BLUE! Even if you have never seen an episode of dragon ball z this movie would still be the worst one you'd ever see. The director was an absolute idiot and this piece of crap has forever scarred the name of Dragon Ball. Our fan base has a saying nowadays.

sebastianarenasulloa,Really Creative and Clever take on the story,9/10,7 December 2016,"All around I found it to be a Really Creative and Clever take on the story, and even an improvement in a few aspects, like joining Martian and Piccolo into one character.I would have changed a few things though: 1. the ending a tiny bit, to make it more similar to DB (I would have had them revive a dead Yamcha instead, for example; and not have the flying Goku by the end, but a powerful well rooted KameHameHa instead); 2. the whole concept of having Goku be the old minion of Piccolo makes no sense at all... it would make Goku older than 2000 year old!, and Goku's grandfather too... It would have been better to have Piccolo explain that his old minion died but that Goku seems to be the same kind of monstrosity, so that hell become the new minion of Piccolo;I really enjoyed it anyway!!

mjnels,Honestly... not bad,9/10,12 February 2017,"Now, i went Dragonball Revolutions with low expectations. But i watched this movie to its entirety and i must say it perfectly captured the essence of three of my favorite series's; Dragonball (obv), Starwars, and Avarter the last Arebender. My nine children loved this movie, which was a nice treat for them considering they didn't get to eat this week. I don't know who Ang's actor was; but they fill the roll perfectly. I coulnt believe it was a movie of the anime! Back to my starving children, now when i gave them the option of getting mac don ald's for dinner, or watching this movie they went with mac don ald's but I KNEW that they really wanted to see this movie. So i chained them back to the radiator and put on this amazing movie. To better understand this movie, my buddie did an intense analysis of this movie from begi nin to end. you can watch this at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2cnpE8NZ-w.I did watch some of the original anime and i was pleasintly surpriuses that Roshi wasn't a pervert in this one; definitely a change for the best. also he dies at the end and gets brought back to life; which i think is a good thing.Needed more Kazaam 8/10"
robsworld247,A good adaption leaving me wanting more.,9/10,11 April 2009,"Just got back from seeing this movie. I went with low expectations and I loved the movie. If you are a true fan of the show; give it a chance and I don't think you'll be disappointed. All I know right now is I want more. If you want my opinion read below.No major complaints from me. This review comes from a TRUE Dragon Ball FRANCHISE fan. Some don't seem to understand there was a series called Dragonball before Dragonball Z I find it funny how most formed their opinions before they even saw this movie. First off: Let me give you a spoiler (ALERT!): Goku is a saiyan; never anywhere in the Manga or Anime does it say he is Asian. If I am wrong, educate me PLEASE! So I am OK with a westerner playing his part because there is an INTERNATIONAL cast. Goku is older than in the original story, it works good. Emperor Pilaf and the Red Ribbon Army were skipped, but it is never said that it never happened. Piccolo is the only major character that is also in Dragonball Z and now that I seen the movie makes sense that they would want to use his story line as a way to connect the movies.To address most common complaint I see: This is a Dragonball movie, not Z that is why the fights do not span miles of land and huge epic power blasts. The characters did not reach those power levels until Dragonball Z. This movie hinted towards awesome fight scenes in future movies. The introduction of each of the characters was decent enough, the best being that of Yamcha. His whole ""Cool, dude, awesome, surf up'' mentality was spot on IMO vs his character in the show. Goku: I had my doubts. There was a moment at the beginning of the movie I sneered because of Goku being like a repressed school geek, I wanted to leave. It was soon forgotten when he went to chi-chi's party and he encountered the 'bullies'. Seeing Goku dodge the punches and jumping around like a monkey gave me a VIVID flash back of EXACTLY how kid Goku would be in DRAGONBALL it was silly and cheesy in all the best ways. Goku sliding upside down on his head is spot on with who the Goku character is. I also read complaints about bad costume design, I disagree. There were subtle hints in several outfits of the blue and orange that are the trademark colors of Goku in the series. And thee trademark orange jumpsuit translated awesome in the live action movie. Whatever material used was a great choice. It was better looking than any cosplay outfit I HAVE EVER SEEN.Grandpa Gohan: The guy who played him was a perfect fit. He's not in the movie too long, but OMG that is almost just like the show. How fing amazing is that. He dies in a different way but it was done in a way that was beneficial to the story line. But hey he still gets crushed!Master Rossi: portrayed very good, dirty old man with good fighting skills that likes to ware Hawaiian shirts. As far as him living in the city. Did they miss he was on an island in the middle of a city and what looked to be a dig site? And a watchful eye would have noticed a poster in back stating it was the site of a future high rise. I foresee a powerful person moving the Kame house to another location buy lifting up the current island. Chi Chi: Just like in the show Goku and her like to fight tournament style(at the end). The set up for her being a complete crazy B were there when they were arguing about who was responsible for her getting hit by Goku. Great potential.Bulma: Read here now, in the show her father is a Caucasian scientist, it would make sense that she be Caucasian also. She has Capsule Corp capsules and the dragon radar. She's sexy and Rossi tries to 'cop a feel' several times. No her panties aren't in it you sick mo's. Not perfect but came across decent enough for me.Yea it sucks Krillin wasn't in there. I say he should have been b/c he's Goku's best friend. I would have dumped Yamcha for Krillin any day but I understand the movie may not have provided a way to introduce him in a way productive to the plot like the way all the other characters were introduced. Goku does mention he doesn't have any friends in this movie. So I speculate the way this story line went they left it open for them to meet in the next movie and become great friends.I didn't think it was too rushed. People talk about plot holes, I say it was done on purpose JUST LIKE IN THE SHOW, things were left open for future explanation and future plot development. To pull my point together here, in Dragonball Z does no one remember how often 'new' flashbacks would occur?! I expect that to continue here.As far as the graphics are, awesome and very realistic and at one moment the trademark fast movement of the hand fighting and blocking hinted towards great battles in future movies. This movie was a giant teaser for me and I can't wait for more. If you read all this go see it. Stay for the credits. The theater was empty and my friend and I were the only ones to see the bonus scene. I left out an awesome detail that I will not reveal because to date no trailers or anyone else hinted towards it, only the movie goers should get to know about it."
jdk602,Not As Bad As You Think!,8/10,19 April 2009,"OK, I get it.The guy who plays Goku isn't Japanese. And the girl who plays Bulma doesn't have blue hair. And the guy who plays Yamcha has a dye job. And there's no Krillin. And Goku's not a kid. And Piccolo doesn't have his green antennae. And they're in high school. And Roshi isn't a creepy perv. But here's the thing: CALM DOWN.Dragonball , the series, is incredible, not to mention complex. And a cartoon. To make a movie out of it, they had to trim some stuff.So, Dragonball Evolution isn't a perfect replica of the series. But it does it's best to stay true to the material and the characters.If you're looking for the exact, spot-on, down to the last detail movie about young Goku and his search for the dragonballs ... you'll be disappointed.But if you want to sit back, relax, and open your mind to this interpretation, I think you'll find it enjoyable."

vmark-99845,Waste of Time,1/10,2 May 2018,"As a child, I was always a fan of Dragon Ball franchise. I watched every episodes and movie. When I heard about this movie, I was excited that the film came out, but when I watched the video, I can describe it as awful. Almost everything from the movie sucks. The characters are all bunch of phonies that don't know to act. They all contradict the story. It changed Goku from a caring person who works hard all the time into a high schooler obsessed with girls and have no friends. The movie is not Dragon Ball. It is just a story with terrible graphics, low-quality plot, and very few characters. A waste of time and a disgrace to all Dragon Ball fans."
TyManUltra,"Take it for what it is, check you brain at the door, have fun",6/10,11 April 2009,"First of all, This movie was made for fans of the series, so if you aren't one, then obviously you're not going to enjoy this fairly campy adaption of an old anime series. If we all remember that this movie IS indeed a kids film, then you should obviously not expect great cinema, but innocent fun, which is exactly what the film is.The violence is fairly mild (but very well choreographed), the effects are sub-par and the acting is laughable, but I didn't mind all of that because this was a new interpretation of a series that I loved as a kid, and all the core ideas and themes from the show are still here.If you can suspend your disbelief and forget about certain large plot holes, you'll have a lot of fun with this movie. If you can't do that, then don't bother because, make no mistake, this is FAR from a good film.

valplusaj,2nd worst movie I've ever seen,1/10,23 November 2021,"Do NOT watch this terrible terrible terrible movie. The story is poorly told and the acting is even worse. I want my time back! Who ever came up with screenplay surely never saw ONE episode of the original anime.
