ruidanielbarrossss,Cowboy Bebop 2021 doesn't deserve a rating of ten or one.,7/10,20 November 2021,"I won't make comparisons with the original animation.I think this show in general is an excellent production. The actors are ok and have great chemistry together.But this show takes a bold approach to the way it tells the story.It tries, perhaps excessively, to be faithful to an Anime narrative structure.It's a western. It's a space opera. It's a buddy cop comedy. It has a noir atmosphere mixed with ultra-over the top action scenes. All mixed in a crazy colored juice.This cocktail isn't easy to make into a live series.And the end result is a highly stylized TV show that is beautiful to watch, well interpreted, but not everything blends in very well.This will certainly work for many people, but for many it won't.So, in the end, what counts is a matter of taste.Try it and you may like it or not.I personally enjoyed some episodes more than others, but I wouldn't mind seeing more.A solid 7 out of 10 for me."
ladyliliroche,Did not expect it to be this enjoyable,8/10,19 November 2021,"Watched the anime like ages ago and went into this with no expectation and got hook.First episode wasn't that great as a pilot but things pick up by the second episode.The fight can look a bit slow sometimes but everything else is enjoyable. The set designs are amazing. I love the retro feel of it. Really captured the cowboy bebop mood.And god the music... Yoko Kanno's Tank! Is that amazing that I didn't skip the intro at all. The whole jazz soundtracks feel so refreshing after watching movies with similar sounds.John Cho is amazing too as Spike. He got the mannerism and coolness, and so is Faye Valentine. I love the witty humour and sarcasm. Jet Black also holds the team together.Plus point for Ein. Adorable."
gabriel_sanchez,"Take it with a grain of salt, but it is a good show if not by their crazy fanbase mad because their beloved anime is being adapted",8/10,29 November 2021,"A funky adaptation that can be seen as its standalone-alternate version of the original Cowboy Bebop.I get it fans are trashing the show because they either are not following the source material fatefully or are following it too much when not necessary, like Radical Ed's introduction, but, hey, I don't mind the adaptation. I take it as a fresher look into the original.Overall, the show is good. All actors fit their role in either a good way or a corky way, but it works.It is goofy, very goofy at times. I believe the show is a work of passion too, so I understand they try to be as ""anime-like"" as they can.With today's Hollywood standards, I don't mind these adaptations. The tech is here, we just need to make it happen. It is definitely way better than Dragonball Evolution (2009)."
catdogmanfish,How is this rated so low?!,10/10,21 November 2021,"Let me start by saying I went into this thinking it would be terrible, boy was I wrong. This series is very well done. They may have some tech not in the anime, and they take a couple liberties with some characters, but they really went deep in their adaptation. The characters, John Cho's Spike is a perfect example, move and speak just like their anike counterparts, the detail is so intricate, it is amazing. I hate to be ""that guy"" but I daresay alot of the negative reviews are probably from people who haven't even seen the show and they just rated it low based on the casting and their dogged defense of the anime. Give this a shot, it is so very good.

yooniverse,Captures the spirit of the original,8/10,21 November 2021,"I know a lot of people are going to be upset that it's not 100% faithful to the anime series, but it manages to capture the style without all the gender or race bending that seems to be so prevalent these days with adaptations. The first episode pays homage to the original, before venturing off to on its own.The show does a good job with the little details, like screen splits and wipes, the soundtrack, ship designs, astral gates, and so on. The humor and the jokes are spot on in the spirit of the original, as are the space western feel, though it's missing a little bit of grittiness. Things are a little too sparkly like JJ Abrams' Star Trek.Acting feels a little forced, but by the third episode or so, I got used to it or they got the screen chemistry right.All in all, with all the recent disappointing adaptations like Foundation, Wheel of Time, Star Trek Discovery, Picard, etc., I'm enjoying Bebop and watching it with a smile on my face."
dubwize,Great adaptation with hints of Firefly,8/10,20 November 2021,"Cowboys, western themes mixed with Sci Fi, Bounty Hunters done with ostentatious flair. That is Cowboy Bebop. Witty, charming and while it is clever, sometimes the camp is overdone. Smart humor, great CGi and worthy of many more episodes.

knedb,People need to stop comparing...,9/10,21 November 2021,"Rate the show based on its own entity. Stop comparing to the anime series. It's a completely different take on the idea and so it doesn't make sense to compare. It makes the other reviews very misleading.Anyways, this show is awesome. It's one of the most entertaining series I've seen in awhile. The action is great. The comedy is great. A perfect blend. I highly recommend.

Turanic,I'll take it,7/10,19 November 2021,"There are three types of people who will watch this show, but it will probably appeal to only two types...
Type one : you love space tv shows, they give you a possibility to see civilization in 500 years, you probably seen everything from Star Trek to LEXX and you are starving for a new space show...
Type two : you happen to be Cowboy Bebop fan by default...
Type three to whom this show might not appeal , people who were randomly looking what to watch in between their Breaking Bad /Brasic/ Peaky Blinders marathon..."
rogier-86785,"Sharp, bloody and witty film-noir scifi",7/10,20 November 2021,"Cowboy Bebop is a live adaptation of a popular anime featuring a group of space bounty hunters nicknamed 'cowboys' who roam the now-populated solar system a few centuries in the future. The tone of the series is light-hearted, featuring typical down-on-their-luck yet likeable main characters who stumble their way into victories against equally incompetent bad guys. It's basically all in good fun.It's universe is a combination of Americana influences from the '50's up to the '70's, Japanese mafia tropes and old-skool visceral science fiction, with a film noir-detective glue that holds it together. It consist of over-the-top but well designed set pieces with characters that find themselves in absurd situations, mostly created by their own antics. Fair warning, it can get pretty bloody at times between all the sarcasm, true to anime heritage.The music is excellent, especially the jazz pieces from all the greats that seem hand-picked to fit the scenes. It's general feel is reminiscent of comic books, with lots of different color schemes, shots from strange angels and short, witty comebacks that could've just as easily been dropped in captions. Blood doesn't drip, it flashes over the screen, that sort of thing.My main criticism are the predictable plot-lines, with one or two nice surprises. Also, not all the jokes land because the editing can be off beat, slowing down the comedic timing of the actors. On these review pages it has been compared to the original, well-loved anime, which I didn't do. Without the comparison, the end-result is a production that could have had a sharper finish, but that doesn't take away much from this futuristic noir-detective that got stuck in the seventies.Don't expect the world and you'll root for these cowboys."
dmerette,I'm enjoying this,9/10,20 November 2021,"I think its well done. Fun dialog. Music is great. Good acting. I'm really enjoying it and I'm not even a anime fan, so give it a try. I dont understand all the bad reviews.

mariousa-54084,Charming TV show,10/10,20 November 2021,"Dont know why there is such a low rating from some I think it has is own charm and realy like the cgi and cast. Hope there will be a second season and of course it's not like the original anime... but its worth watching.

worksmart-58506,Bravo!!,10/10,19 November 2021,"Honestly wasn't expecting much from this because the original is so damn brilliant and i thought maybe Cho wasn't the best actor for the role. HOWEVER i couldn't be happier with what this show is. It captures all the genius of the anime while keeping as grounded in reality as much as possible. The casting is actually amazing and although I miss Spike's raspy voice, Cho is fantastic and a really good martial artist to boot.The effects are brilliant and 100% true to the original, and it has all the rawness, violence, humor and emotion of the anime.Ignore the bad reviews! Pure nonsense. I see people complaining the music doesn't work, there's too much violence, it's not close enough to the original or instead too close, tries to be something it's not etc etc. Very clear these are trolls or people who're just completely clueless as to the brilliance of the original, because none of these complaints make any sense.Possibly the best Netflix production yet...bravo!!!"
hydralien-40230,Hit and miss,7/10,20 November 2021,"There are expected controversies around how faithful it is (or should be) to the source material - some points are literal retelling of the story, some are drastically different. I think it's mostly good that they're changing the story at times, it's a new material and a new medium after all. And I think they actually are the story difference are actually fixing the issue of the source material where the story was not sufficiently told in the end.What's really great about the live action series is a visual style - it's realistic (the CGIs are mostly about space and some background imagery) yet very bright and vivid and ever-so-slightly goofy. The pace and character development is also great, it's all coming together nicely.But it's a real hit-and-miss in the actors department - some of them are really in the right place and the resulting characters are truly great (like Spike and Jet), some of them come unbalanced (like Faye), and some are a complete disaster (like Vicious and Julia), which is really irritating.It's still very worth the time, for it's a quirky and goofy blend of visual greatness and great characters."
pensman,Old school meets new school meets Whatever,9/10,26 November 2021,"Just pure fun. Basically, it's watching a crew of crazy bounty hunters chase the wanted through a universe out of a demented anime future that mixes jazz, special effects, and a great cast who pull it all together. It seems someone or something blows up every other scene. I like to kick back and watch ""Peter Gunn"" and ""Richard Diamond"" in space opera: BOOM.

IonicBreezeMachine,"A flawed adaptation that doesn't reach the level of its inspiration, but is stylish and well made with good performances",7/10,5 December 2021,"In the future, mankind has established colonies throughout the solar system and left Earth behind. In this future, bounty hunters known colloquially as ""Cowboys"" travel the galaxy looking to collect prices on the heads of any number of terrorists and criminals. The show follows the crew of the spaceship Bebop owned by a former cop, Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir), whose past has left him a mixture of man and machine with cybernetic limbs and prosthetics, former syndicate enforcer, Spike Spiegel (John Cho), who is haunted by his past and the woman, Julia (Elena Satine), he left to it, opportunistic cowboy, and Faye Valentine (Daniella Pineda), a woman with no memories of her past life before being revived cryogenically and swindled by a con artist as the group work as ""Cowboys"" to try in vain to keep their heads and ship above water. Meanwhile, Vicious (Alex Hassell), Spike's former partner whose now married to Julia gets wind that Spike is still alive after having seemingly killed him years ago and sets out to kill him while also staging a coup within the Red Dragon Syndicate.Airing in 1998 in Japan and making its debut in 2001 on Adult Swim in the United States, Cowboy Bebop is often regarded as one of the quintessential modern anime classics due to its richly nuanced characters, eclectic mix of styles and influences, and a soundtrack rich with personality. Since 2008, Studio Sunrise and Shinichiro Watanabe, the company and director behind the original have been closely involved with attempts to bring the property to feature film format with an incarnation at 20th Century Fox starring Keanu Reeves as Spike Spiegel beginning development only to languish in development hell much like other long gestating adaptations like the since released Ghost in the Shell movie or the ongoing cycle of green lighting and cancelation that is the Akira adaptation. Eventually the project landed at Tomorrow Studios, the producers of the successful TV adaptations of Hanna and Snowpiercer and secured distribution for Cowboy Bebop at Netflix alongside an in development adaptation of the One Piece manga. After a 14 year journey, the Cowboy Bebop adaptation is okay.The show makes a good impression with its three leads played by Mustafa Shakir, John Cho, and Elena Satine as Jet Black, Spike Spiegel, and Faye Valentine respectively. The three have a natural chemistry that comes through in their performances and from the way they carry themselves to their various interactions over the course of the show, the three convey that ""dysfunctional family"" dynamic that was present in the original series while making it their own. The cast all hold their own in the action sequences and were reportedly trained by 87eleven Action Design who were also responsible for the stunt work in Atomic Blonde, Nobody, and the John Wick series and it shows with the choreography smooth and engaging with good sense of spatial geography and flow. The production design is also well done capturing most of the future present in the original series with a mixture of film-noir, western, and 70s iconography that made the style and environment such an engaging place.The show this time around tries to have a ""binge friendly"" narrative as opposed to the episodic closed ended nature of the episodes of the original series where Watanabe treated each one like a stand alone movie. The original show despite being seemingly limited by a half-hour runtime managed to fit in a lot of plot and character through visual storytelling and atmospheric visuals where the music would play over moments of science and emptiness to convey a sense of mood and atmosphere. The show tries to build a season long arc out of Vicious' coup with the syndicate and on paper it's not a terrible idea for a overarching narrative as it was briefly glimpsed at in the show, but unfortunately the syndicate coup and its politics are probably the least interesting thing in the series and feel more like a weight the show is dragging around with it. While there are ""villains of the day"" most of them aren't all that engaging and pale in comparison to the menace, mystery, or humor of their counterparts to the original series. Some parts do still resonate such as episode 7 where Faye finds a VHS tape that's a clue to her past, and the acting by Elena Satine along with the direction and music manages to capture the same level of emotional resonance that was in the original. Unfortunately that's only one scene where I got that level of emotional resonance with most of the other scenes never really achieving that.Cowboy Bebop doesn't escape the shadow cast by its anime counterpart, but it's also not a complete failure either as seen with instances such as Guyver, Fist of the North Star, or Dragonball: Evolution. In terms of anime adaptions by western studios Cowboy Bebop hovers somewhere between Christophe Gans' adaptation of Crying Freeman and Robert Rodriguez/James Cameron's adaptation of Battle Angel: Alita. The show is perfectly serviceable in its inaugural season even if I'm not sold on every aspect of it, and the ending to season one promises further divergence for season 2 should it be renewed. But considering that redux/remake versions of Evangelion, Berserk, and Sailor Moon exist, this should be taken for what it is: another approach to the material. It doesn't replace the original nor should it, and it's okay enough that it won't dissuade people from checking out the original. Who knows? Maybe this will nudge people towards checking out the original series."
johntk1566,So much fun,9/10,21 November 2021,"Watched and loved the original back in the early '00s. I didn't expect this new series to be a joygasm of nostalgic rememberries, and it's not...because nothing is...ever.That being said, I really enjoyed this adaptation of the story and the new approach on the characters. The balance between action, comedy and drama was done really well. I'm really looking forward to how they'll continue things.

divg-57-800054,"Not epic, not like the anime, but still fun to watch.",7/10,21 November 2021,"-For me the cast is decent, except Faye Valentine (Pineda), but still tolerable.-The universe, visuals and costumes are good.-The fighting scenes were ok
-The plot changed a lot, but i understand that adaptations do that, so I'm not angry like many here.-If you never watched the anime, this series could worth a watch. If you are a true fan, dont expect a spectacular and accurate adaptation.-The ones who gave 1 star are too salty, maybe their nostalgia is too strong, and they just shouldn't see any live action adaptations.

Snownoise,John Cho surprisingly pulled it off well.,7/10,21 November 2021,"I was skeptical about the cast at first, but John Cho was surprisingly pulling Spike off very well. Now, I can't seem to find any other actors to play Spike other then John Cho. Jet Black, on the other hand, the beard on him looks too artificial. It just doesn't sit well on the guy. They could have styled the beard as its own since they changed the character to a black guy, but then somehow they attached the original character's beard on him which seems to be the general issue in this show. They changed some elements in the animation and adopted new things to a live action show, but then they somehow applied original elements back to new things. They don't get along well together, and often produces some silly chuckles and eye sores just like Jet Black's beard. Overall, the show is interesting as its own. It could have been better if they have made it as a standalone show instead of making a carbon-copy version of the original animation.

yamagata@virtual-markets.net,This is more than a decent effort.,9/10,19 November 2021,"I am glad I saw this episode before looking at the reviews. I really liked the effort that was put in the first episode. The music, the visuals and the acting all brought the anime to into mind. I really like John Cho in this role, but I have yet to see anything that I did not like that he was in. The actor that played Jet captured the essence of the role, and the actress that played Faye Valentine was more that adequate in her role. You should not go into this with expectations. I for one was impressed by what they achieved and it was a good time well spent. I am glad I watched this. I will see if the series holds up over the long haul, but after the first episode, I give it a 9.

ty-jensen,Cool space western!,8/10,21 November 2021,"I was aware of Cowboy Bebop in high school but I didn't see this anime till it launched on Netflix. If Blockbuster had Cowboy Bebop, I would of rented it. I knew the movie was standalone but I wanted to see the show first. I enjoyed both versions, yes the anime is better.The acting is great, I think most fans agree. The cast have good chemistry which is crucial. I probably would be more critical if I watched the anime a few times. The guy who played Vicious was good but I skipped a few scenes, I partially watched this show at night.I think Cowboy Bebop is fairly faithful to the anime, I seen it only once. I think hardcore fans feel its only loosely faithful to the anime. The show isn't overly serious, I guess it has more humor than the anime.The cinematography and sets are good, this universe looks lived in like the original Star Wars trilogy. Both versions blend the past and future mainly the weapons and cars. Having said that, the CGI is lame. Maybe some fans feel this show almost looks fan made.The action scenes are fun, they're well shot and edited. Maybe the first action scene was somewhat choppy. The action is bloody but stylish so it shouldn't offend anyone too much.Overall, Cowboy Bebop is a fun space western. I recommend it to anime fans and science fiction fans. I guess hardcore fans are disliking this show. Hopefully Cowboy Bebop gets renewed, I see it having three seasons."
danteshamest,Campy and Fun Adaptation,8/10,19 November 2021,"A lot of love and effort went into this adaptation. It won't please everybody, but for the most part I can see the creators have tried to be faithful to the important parts of the anime.I admit I had my doubts about John Cho, but he plays a really cool Spike. Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda also deliver good performances as Jet and Faye. The dialogue is campy, but in a good way like the Kill Bill movies.The episode plots are based on the anime, but also fleshed out a lot more. For example, in episode 1 of both the anime, they don't show exactly how Asimov survives the bar shooting, but in this adaptation he is clearly shown to be shot, but the bullet wounds aren't fatal thanks to RedEye.Die hard fans will always fine something to complain about Netflix adaptations, but I for one am happy with this series overall."

Tweekums,Solid sci-fi series inspired by a classic anime,8/10,12 December 2021,"This sci-fi series, inspired by the classic anime of the same name, is centred on three bounty hunters who hunt down the solar system's low lives. They are based aboard a spaceship called the 'Bebop. Spike Spiegel is a former gangster and his partner Jet Black is an ex-cop; they are later joined by Faye Valentine; a woman who's past is a mystery to all... including herself. Over the course of the series they have various run-ins. As well as following this trio we see scenes featuring Vicious, Spike's one time friend who is determined to kill him; he is also ascending in the Red Dragon Crime Syndicate.I was a little apprehensive going into this; I really enjoyed the anime and was fearful that this would disappoint. During the opening episode I suspected my fears might have been justified; I thought it was trying to copy the original too closely... scenes that looked cool when animated felt a little cheesy in live action. I'm glad I stuck with it though as I found the series growing on me; especially after Faye joined the crew... by the end I was really hooked so was more than a little disappointed to learn that it had been cancelled. I thought the cast was pretty solid; they may not have been exactly like their anime counterparts but that wasn't a problem for me. The tone is quite dark at times; particularly towards the end; there is also quite a lot of swearing, which I don't recall in the anime version. Overall I'd say this turned out better than I expected; I'd love it if Netflix un-cancelled it but to be honest I can't see that happening."
Alcaminhante,Excellent tv space opera with a classic retro feel and tons of humor set on a really detailed amazing unique universe.,10/10,24 November 2021,"I was never a big fan of the anime itself, but somehow this live action caught me off guard and I totally love it.The concept design is fantastic in the way it brings to life the limited drawings from the anime and this is one of the best looking space series in years.I don't understand how some people don't enjoy all the weirdness of the atmosphere because I love the tone of the humor and most of all the visual references and in jokes. By the way was that the bar from el mariachi / DESPERADO Robert Rodriguez movie in the first episode of this series ?!...
The whole thing feels like a cross between the 5th element, firefly , Killjoys and a bunch of other stuff but the 70s vibe gives it a really fun personality.I like the humor, the characters and the classic space opera adventure feel and I don't mind the changes relating to the original anime at all.Now I just want to go buy this to own it in Blu-ray and i hope they release a good concept art book from this series soon too.Ignore the bad hype. If you love classic space opera with a retro feel this is for you.And if you like this one also check out another series called Vagrant Queen which has a similar vibe and it's even more crazy. There's only one season of that one but it's a blast. I hope cowboy now gets a few more seasons and not end up like the Vagrant Queen series did."
dmoorejr,Faithful Yet Different,9/10,20 November 2021,"Faithful, yet different. Cowboy Bebop takes everything great about the anime, and it translates well with the set/costume design. Beautiful Cinematography, and stunt work. They even manage to add dimensions to the main characters that previously weren't in the anime. Some may think that's a negative but it's not. And this show isn't a direct frame to frame copy. However it does hold up on it's own. 10 episodes is a perfect season length. And was very surprised how well this was made. Anime die hards will never like live action, and you cant fault every live action adaptation for being one.

rdvljunk,slow start but grows,7/10,25 November 2021,"It is hard to make a real-life version of an anime, actually to make a good real-life version is nearly impossible. Life actors simply can not compare to an anime, nor can the setting be copied, no matter how hard you try. It is a completely different atmosphere and dynamics. I just do not understand why movie makers don't get it that life action and anime are different worlds.Having said that, I have to admit this is a pretty good try. A lot of style elements of the anime have been copied successfully, although also some are dearly missed. The stories are in general simplified (like the fight with the mad clown) and characters like Ed are missing. Ep 1 is pretty bad as an intro to the series and makes you fear that this is another insult to a classic anime, but after that the series grows and gets it's own flow. It is very worth while to watch, however fans of the original anime will, of-course, keep mentally referring to the anime and miss a lot of the anime's characteristics and story-line."
jakespina,Not Nearly as Bad as People Made it Sound,7/10,22 November 2021,"My only casting dislike so far is Faye Valentine.The writing for her is awful, and her delivery is even worse. She also doesn't look the part either. Faye was the stereotypical femme Fatale in appearance, but juxtaposed by her brash nature. This actress lacks the first part, which is important to her character. She's cringeworthy. Also not a fan of vicious, either. But I'm telling ya Faye is really bad.Jet is great. Spike is pretty good.They NAILED the environment and atmosphere. Production is amazing. That really helps the affair.Music is the best of all. Amazing. They brought back the same guy from the anime. It's incredible stuff.They did make some stupid changes to things that I found entirely unnecessary, though. Why? Beats me.It's not the anime and it never could be. But it's a damn good show, especially when you compare it to every other animation adaptation to live actionGive it a shot and don't let others whining taint your experience."
smaniatopoulos,Halfway review.,7/10,20 November 2021,"So this show comes with very heavy legacy, namely the extremely stylish and memorable direction and aesthetic of the legendary anime director Shinichoro Watanabe, whose original production made Cowboy Bebop famous as one of the best anime shows of all time.Now the reason the anime was so famous is because it is a curious blend of entertaining story and likeable (but somewhat cliched) characters coupled with incredible visuals and unbelievable music.More importantly, the color palette and imagery of the anime series created a very original mixture of cyberpunk and the wild west, with bright and earthy colors and ultra modern cities that somehow seemed old and dirty, the way some towns of the Old West look half eaten by the desert and forgotten by time.It was a very unique visual style.And it has not been replicated ever since.The NETFLIX series is completely different. Though it adapts the storyline, the characters and the universe of the original Bebop series, its blue, cold palette has nothing to do with cowboys or deserts. It is an ultra modern, tv-series scifi aesthetic, that looks completely different in tone and style to the original. Even the close-up shot of the famous ""rose in a puddle"" from episode 1 manages to look significantly different.And as a result, this show is lacking character. It screams ""generic scifi, no distinctive style, no uniqueness, no Watanabe"".The cast is also a mixed bag. John Cho is not believable as Spike, and though he tries to bring personality to the part, he just doesn't look it at all. Think of it a bit like Bruce Willis playing James Bond. Mustafa Shakir is considerably better as Jet Black.However, as it happens with Manga adaptations (think Ghost in the Shell), both are underacting their parts. This is why American comic book characters (eg Marvel) come across as more believable when played by actors: ""Manga acting"" requires Al Pacino in Scarface levels of intensity.The music is unbelievably great, as it was in the original, and you should stick with the show for a couple of episodes -even if you don't like it- just to listen to the soundtrack.Overall, this adaptation is subpar, mostly because they failed to capture the Watanabe aesthetic and style. The best way to describe it is to say that it feels like a Tarantino remake shot by some random tv show director.I give it a 7 because, despite its flaws, it's well produced, the CGI looks occasionally excellent and the story is enjoyable. If you like hard scifi, you will enjoy this.But Cowboy Bebop, it ain't."
daisukereds,"""Brainless Fleck of Mediocrity""",3/10,19 November 2021,"I watched the Anime many moons ago, and re-watched some to compare, but I completely understand it's charm. My favorite part of the franchise will continue to be the animated movie! This adaptation is heavily modified scripts, and it's not a faithful adaptation. For example, dogs in this universe are a commodity instead of being common ""mongrels"". And more importantly, many character changes are considerably worse. A focus on a certain character instead of a more ""family"" theme hurts it. This is, subjectively, a big downgrade.Choreographies are good for the most part. It is a bit awkward, with some very nice stunts here and there, and the occasional use of interesting camera work. At time, ""hits"" have no weight to them (partially a physical thing as well as a lack of proper sound editing) and not as dynamic, as what you can achieve on paper. The dialogue is at times bland and predictable. The colorful music (obviously the best part of it) doesn't work as well over the gray and brown filter the whole show has.Regarding the casting, John Cho is a tad too old for the role of a ruminating yet cool guy. And that's a big detriment to the youthful and charming character that is Spike. Still his portrayal is acceptable for adaptation standards. Certainly not memorable. Mustafa, on the other hand, is easily the best of the bunch.. but makes me wonder if it is the case because of comparison. As partners, they work well together and makes the show watchable. Then comes the worst part.. instead of Faye Valentine, we get the annoying character Daniela Pineda portrayed in Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom. Sadly, very unlikable. Funny how the cowboy Judy from ""Big Shot"" is practically the same eye-candy character, but they were worried about Faye's looks. And finally, both Vicious and Julia feel like a downgrade. Giving them more spotlight is not always a good thing. Sometimes, the enigma and mystery of their personalities is a positive.. not here.It's an overall cheap-looking show (almost fan-made) with a great score.. From sets to costume design, to visual effects. And as a ""space opera"", is a bit lacking. Feels like it was made for the masses, much like with Death Note before it.""If you are going to change something, do it better, not worse."""
bobetjo,Quite Enjoyable and Faithful,8/10,22 November 2021,"I was not sure I was going to like this. But actually the acting by all the characters carries off the anime style of speech without embarrassment. The fight scenes are not overdone and the action bears a resemblance to the Tarantino.The graphics portray real scenery modelled almost as cartoon. And it gets away with it.There is a great 90s feel. I liked it. It kept moving.

therskybznuiss,Would be run of the mill Sci-Fi Sit Com if it weren't called Cowboy Bebop.,4/10,6 December 2021,"Everything good about it is from the anime, everything that sucks is what's been altered/adapted/changed from the anime.I might have given this a 6 if they'd somehow not tried to commercialze the crap out of this.The fact that there's no end in site truly is a shame, Spike isn't supposed to be a 50 year old male, Faye is supposed to be a femme-fatale and Vicious isnt supposed to be some Shakespearean Flamer.Eff this show in it's current form.

BennyTV,Umm- people have selective memories i guess-,7/10,20 November 2021,"Dude- the anime was way ahead of its time, so much so that it was scary accurate in predictions- just like other sci-fi greats.My advice to most is: dont re-watch the anime. You saw it 22 years ago and there is no need to ruin this version by drawing comparisons which, is satisfyingly true to the original source material in more ways than not. If you watch this after rewatching the anime, it will seem redundant. Which is why i will save the original for after this pretty dope ass show.Everything is smooth and violent and slick and beautiful.I think people forget that wayyy back in '98, trans, sexuality, social commentary... was all present in the anime. It takes place in the future for poops sake- of course it wasnt forced. Doesnt feel forced here either its just; unfortunately the world we live in. If you want content, you gotta put up with a minimal amount of wokeness. But in general, all other shows and movies are too woke and annoying and ruin the story.Just watch the first 2 episodes and decide to continue or not. What else u got goin on?"
deadshyguy,"It's great, def worth watching if you're a fan of the anime",8/10,19 November 2021,"Well done adaption that embraces the campiness of the anime and does it damn well, Netflix actually listened to the fans and gave them a solid recreation of the anime with a few twists and changes that don't stint the series and keep things fresh.

jimwt66,Not a show for me it seems.,4/10,12 December 2021,I gave it 3 episodes but the fight scenes looked like they were doing rehearsal of the fights. The moves were slow and looked like they were thinking in their head Step 1: swing right fist. Step 2 duck. You can ever see where it looks like they were posing so that fight scene could toss them or something.The acting and other things were mediocre and I could have watched the rest if the fight scenes didn't look like it was their first time rehearsing them. Even the scenes where they were practicing with the wooden dummy looked slow and was just going through the motions.Who knows...Maybe I am spoiled with skilled fighters doing the scenes in other movies. Maybe they speed them up so it looks faster. If so they should have done that with this show.If you are OK with mediocre acting and lame fight scenes then give it a whirl.
cgvsluis,Really on the fence...and leaning towards disappointment.,5/10,20 November 2021,"3...2...1... Let's Jam!Ok, I have been a HUGE original animated Cowboy Bebob series fan for over two decades. When I heard they were doing a live action version, I was cautiously optimistic and skeptical at the same time. When I saw the teasers...I was pretty turned off.It is hard for me to go from the all Japanese production and voice cast...to this multiracial cast, where no one really looks quite right. I actually like the actor John Cho, so I wasn't totally upset that he was cast to be Spike. He really doesn't look like Spike (and the hair is driving me crazy! Not in a good way.), but he did seem to get the banter with Jet down when they were alone together aboard The Bebop. I'm neutral on Jet, I expected him to be bigger and a little more muscular in the chest and arm, but I don't dislike him in the role.The actress who plays Faye, however, is probably the biggest casting travesty that I have ever seen. I just don't see how they are ever going to make that work. She is completely lacking in the fieriness in conjunction with the sexuality of Faye.Jury is still out on Vicious...and our mysterious rose tattooed lady....sigh! Really? They couldn't have done a better job with Julia? What is wrong with her face?As for the production...it is ok. I like some of the colors and sets, those seem to be an attempt to have the look and feel of the original, and the music! I am thrilled that they brought back the composer Yoko Kanno, because the Bebop jazz was a huge part of the original series.Note for the direction...the first episode, first fight scene in the casino...the music should have been louder and the fight better coordinated with the jazz in order to really do justice to the original. When the sax blasts I want that to be a hit or a shot on the bad guy. And don't loose those slow motion bits with the jazz either. It made the fight scenes in the original.I am 100% not of Japanese ancestry, but have multiple friends who are. I was kind of offended that there doesn't seem to be any Japanese or even Japanese-American actors in this production...and that they have a Korean American playing Spike, an African American playing Jet, a Hispanic American playing Faye, a Russian (maybe Russian American?) playing Julia and a Brit playing Vicious? They couldn't find any Japanese or Japanese American actors to play at least one of the major roles as an homage to the original Japanese production?So far it reminds me more of a Robert Rodriguez production that a Shinichiro Watanabe production. And don't mistake what I am saying, I also love Robert Rodriguez productions...but I was hoping this Cowboy Bebop would be more Watanabe than Rodriguez."
quizote,Loving this,10/10,19 November 2021,"I saw some negative reviews, I'm not sure what they were expecting. I have watched 3 episodes, and I absolutely love each one. I watched the anime years back, so I'm not making any comparisons. I am just loving the dynamic between Jet and Spike, and I'm really feeling Jet's character. The sci-fi is also well done and really no complaints from this viewer. Kudos Netflix, it was worth the wait.

rich7354,Just doesn't cut it.,4/10,19 December 2021,"First, let me state that I've never heard of, nor seen the anime version; so I have no preconceived notions. Here are my impressions.The good:
Very cool premise, it's what drew me in to being with.Nice visuals.Interesting cinematography.That's about it :(The meh:
Acting.Directing.Character development.Story.The bad:
Juvenile writing.No real plot.Terrible fight choreography.Over reliance on slow mo.Cookie cutter characters with no real depth.Childish dialog.It goes out of it's way to be humorous, but falls flat.Mostly dull and predictable."

wolfghostninja,Really really good.,8/10,28 November 2021,"I never saw the anime, so I am not carrying all that baggage - I am however carrying some baggage - principally the fact that Netflix consistently under delivers and has been doing so for a couple of years now. Having said that, Cowboy Bebop is a welcome, refreshing, but all too rare quality turn from the studio.Quirky, well cast, excellent locations and sets, great world building, and a jazzy noirish score. I loved every minute.Highlights include Mustafa Shakir (Jet Black), who has great screen presence, Daniella Pineda (Faye Valentine) for her IDGAF attitude, and Alex Hassell (Vicious) who seems born to play psychopathic villains.Fingers crossed for a season 2, definitely underrated here. Watch.

degrees-33365,True to the source,9/10,22 November 2021,"Straight up loved it.Great to see a tv adaptation with actors staying true to the original. I utterly enjoyed it. Sure, the fighting scenes were pretty bad but everything else came into place.

ladymidath,Space Cowboys,10/10,25 November 2021,"I was really on the fence about how to rate the live action Cowboy Bebop. I love the original anime and the manga and I usually hate American remakes, like Deathnote. So why the high score? Because I could see how much love went into making the live action series. First of all, they brought back Yoko Kanno for the musical score. She also scored the anime as well. Second of all, the casting of Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black. His was perfect casting. I also don't mind John Cho as Spike Spiegel. I know there are a lot of people that didn't like Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine because the character was originally from Singapore and the actress is Hispanic, but for me that is not a huge problem as she does a pretty good job. Also I know that many people hated the way that Alex Hassell played Vicious. Again that is something that I am torn on. I like Alex Hassell, but I don't think he brought enough menace to the role of the cold blooded killer and sociopath that Vicious is. Also, why bring in the sub plot of one of the elders being Vicious' father? That seemed a little odd. Ein the dog was fine and most of the other casting was good as well. The music of course was perfect and the action scenes were plentiful and fun.Now for the nitpicks and problems that I had. First of all, why give Jet a daughter? The closest thing he had to a daughter was Ed. Also, why recast Whitney Haggis Matsumoto as a woman, then soften the anger and betrayal that Faye felt against him for saddling her with a huge amount of debt? Pierrot Le Fou was afraid of cats, not dogs, otherwise the actor was great in the role.Gren was horribly damaged by cruel experiments and now he is changed to being non binary.But the biggest change was to Julia, played by Elena Satine \. Except for her long flowing blond hair, she was virtually unrecognizable. She ends up becoming a cold blooded dragon, taking over from Vicious. That was the one change I really hated as in the series, Julia was a sympathetic character who was on the run from Vicious. This is one change that I can't fathom.There are a lot more smaller changes as well, but minor so I won't list them all here. Now normally these changes would piss me off as Cowboy Bebop is a classic, but I do understand that to adapt something from anime to live action, or to a foreign audience, some changes have to be made.Despite all this, I still found myself enjoying the show. The actors all have good chemistry and do a great job of bringing the characters tto life. Now another big complaint against the show, is that it's too action based and misses the nuances of the characters and their struggles and individual journeys. The humour and banter are still there though. Now, for Ed. Where was Edward ""Radical Ed"" Wong Hau Pepelu Tivruski IV? Well, she didn't turn up until the very end, but there were mentions of her throughout the series. I think this was to ensure a second season. I know the reviews have been mixed, mostly negative, but I found things to enjoy in this series."
jochemunlimited,It grows,8/10,28 November 2021,"I never seen the anime, I only watched a view parts on Youtube to compare. I think it is looking and feeling the same, but that is just a first glance.So from episode I watched a few episodes and I was thinking: is it every episode like this? Just fight like a married couple, doing stupid jokes, nothing is serious etc. No real story. Everything just ends bad. I also did not like the scenery much, it is just Earth with some Jazz/noir sauce on. The technology part is subtle. Like they use normal weapons a lot, but they also have sci-fi looking weapons. First I had the game Borderlands in my mind, but I stopped with that comparison later on.But suddenly I did not pay attention to it anymore, I got used to it that a scene is just at some bar or at a street. You do not see much of the planet itself. But I like the style, it still has some cartoonish and it looks normal, but there is something off the whole time. So I like it. I think the balance is created by bringing in Faye. Spike and Jet are not bickering so much anymore, they focus it now on Faye I think. There is also more story/background, so that is nice.I like the acting of all people. Everybody has it's own style and they are not doing weird things you do not expect. I know John only from his role in 'off centre' so I had not so much expectation, but I have some cathing up to do I see! I think he fits perfectly in the series.So I am busy with episode 9 now, and I am liking it. Yes it is weird, it is different, but it is also not very original storywise and there are some cliches, but if you do the rest perfect, then it is no problem at all. So for me it is just a very fun series to look, I do not take it very serious, they also don't. And like I said, a lot of things they do perfect and I like the characters."
christeasdale-26776,Stop thinking about the anime series!,8/10,24 November 2021,"Ffs you can't win these days. If you do something the same, people kick off. If you change things, people kick off. If you're going to watch a series or movie based on anime, books, previous films and TV shows etc, best thing to do is to not think of the source while watching.If all you're gonna do is compare and complain that it's just the same or that it's too different. Then why even bother watching.And yeah it is rather corny. However, I've a feeling it's supposed to be. I think you'd have to be a complete and utter moron to think otherwise. The cheesy goofball style kinda reminds me of Scott pilgrim. Which I loved. I would recommend this to anyone with a sense of humour, who also has the mental capacity to separate this version from the original.

ChungMo,It's Cowboy Bebop and not - unfortunately,6/10,30 December 2021,"Already cancelled - mixed feelings about it.The biggest worry going in to watching this live action adaptation was if it was going to be the most expensive cosplay video ever made. It is and isn't at the same time. The main problem from my point of view is that the creators of this production either didn't understand one of the main components of the original anime or actively chose to ignore it. It's the music, not just the sound of the music but that the entire anime was composed like music. Granted that it's easier to do this with animation than live action, but it seems to me that the highly talented team behind this didn't get it. One you remove the music and make it largely an afterthought, you've removed the Bebop.They also had a few problems with the casting and their approach. While the two leads for Jet Black and Faye Valentine got their characters down and added their own twists which is great, the actors playing Spike and Vicious seemed frequently lost and unsure of who they were playing. Neither really got their characters solid although John Cho seemed to get more comfortable as the series progressed. Vicious never went past a Harry Potter villain in looks or behavior.The decision to open the series with a well-filmed but nihilistic Zack Snyder influenced action scene probably put people off. To have Spike just gunning people down right off so casually was a big, big mistake. The anime never made this mistake. Probably the big audience drop off can be attributed to things like this, the lead not fitting into the part (I'll blame the directors and a probably tight production schedule first before the actor himself) and too many things happening that made sense to people who watched the anime but not to new viewers.After watching the anime again, my initial disdain for this live action interpretation wore off and I have come to appreciate some of their new additions to the story which I thought were actually taken from the anime. They are that integrated into the Cowboy Bebop universe. The one I still don't care for is the introduction of daddy issues for Vicious, can we please stop this overly repeated theme in superhero, fantasy and sci-fi productions?The reordering of the anime's story arc to now revolve around Vicious and the complete non-inclusion of Radical Ed can be argued. My feeling is that it took away the needed humor which balanced out the anime. But it does close out the storyline instead of leaving everything hanging with the cancellation, so there's that.Am I sad a second season isn't in the offering now? Yes, I actually am interested in how they would have continued it (also dreading where it could have been taken) but in the end I have the original anime in a BluRay set to watch and that's fine for me."
Tactrix,Not the right vibe..,6/10,19 November 2021,"They took a beautifully written and acted Anime and turned it into a horribly written and tacky live action series. And you know what the sad part is, it's not like they tried to do a different show, they tried to remake the same show in a live action format but for some incomprehensible reason didn't use the original lines which were perfect.Here are some things that just don't work. First the casting, this is an opinion but Spike and Faye should have been cast as Sung Kang, and Olivia Munn and Vicious should have been cast as Benedict Cumberbatch. They have a much better likeness and the right demeanor for those particular roles.Second thing the original show worked because the feel was that it was a drama/tragedy with occasional quirky moments. The live action series on the other hand seems like a bad tacky comedy with occasional drama involved.Third and I can't stress this enough, they did everything wrong when it came to the execution of the actual pivotal scenes. For example, in the first episode in the bar scene in the anime you have the woman ordering a bloody mary, the reason for this is specifically so that the bartender can claim he's out of tomato juice which is code for redeye, however in the live action series they cut that entire part out and replaced it with a bunch of irrelevant gibberish none of which adds to the story or establishes atmosphere.And while we're on subject of atmosphere why do all the henchmen look like they're trying to act as if they were a gang from Grease? They look so obviously fake and act so poorly that I almost laughed, it's like they picked up every reject from theater troops and put them in this live action disaster."
blackmamba99971,It's just like the series,10/10,20 November 2021,"This is a fantastic live action series based on the original anime. John Cho - Spike Spiegle (AKA) fearless who was part of an underground crime mafia group known as the syndicate. The action is fantastic, music is top notch, as well as the deep underlying stories of each character, which blends so well to the fast pace environments under protective shields that protect ordinary citizens from the vacuum of space.Daniella Pineda who plays Valentine is as perky, ruthless, kick ass, and downright visceral when it comes to getting what she wants. Not to mention of becoming one of the most bad ass bounty hunters in the known galaxy or solar system. On top of that, there is also the captain of Bebop, Jet black played by Mustafa Shakir. Together, all three make the bebop famous as well as nostalgic for the devoted fans out there who keep this franchise alive and well.For years I was wondering on when this classic series was going to go live action. And finally it came true. It's fast paced, with great fights, humor, gore in a few episodes, and highly charged for all of the extra bonus features such as locations, technology, as well as the razor ship flown by Spike. If any series has impressed me the most, it has to be Cowboy Bebop.With that said, I've also learned that a few studios are beginning talks on whether or not one of the most famous animation movies will go to live action soon. Warner brothers in the past has brought us Titan, Bleach, Gintama and a few others to mention a few. The animation to go live action will be none other than -- AKIRA.Ghost in the shell was a disaster mostly because the producers had their hands in the project and that most if not all of the characters were non-Japanese. What also made the film a flop was the fact that the main title sequence had none of the original soundtrack which was provided in the original movie by award winning composer Kenji Kawai.Cowboy bebop however did its name proud of keeping to the original musical scope that the series was well known for. It set the pace for action, mystery, drama, or any emotional impact that was needed to keep the audiences riveted. I highly recommend this series to any and all fans of Cowboy bebop. You will not be disappointed in this galactic tale set against the backdrop of the universe."
ercfunk-445-950046,Has flaws but overall pretty good,8/10,23 November 2021,"I'd saw they did an incredible job of transforming anime to live action. The tones, the scenes, it feels very close to the source anime. I think the cast mostly did well in their perspective roles. Eventhough they race swapped Jet I think he did great job capturing the character.Faye on the other hand I thought was a miss. The costume is what so many focus on and really it wasn't *that* far off. I'd change the color (to the OG yellow) and then leave the rest. The actress on the other hand did not capture the character. She just didn't seem like Faye at all really.Lastly, needs more E1n. More corgis always makes things better.

holtrowley,Not Better then the Anime But they did pretty good.,8/10,21 November 2021,"It felt very close to the OG anime. Yes there are changes so if you are looking for an exact mirror copy of the anime you prob won't be happy. I actually kinda liked they changed it a bit. As a huge fan of the anime it was nice to see a bit of change so I don't see every thing coming. It's similar enough that you know what's going on but just different enough people I notice. I love the music as it stick to the anime!! The intro!! So good!!! Classic!If you are watching this and never the anime
Just know it's based on an anime and they tried to keep a lot of the fun things like the music etc. The only reason I give it an 8 is at point I thought the fighting felt to rehearsed it looks like dancing. That is just sometimes. Mainly the first fight scene. Also the CG can be a bit questionable but it's good and I still Enjoyed it.

grlym-46849,Corny but good,6/10,21 November 2021,"So I know this show is sourced from anime. So I imagine the critiques on a semi American version will be through the roof.However, I know nothing out it but that people want to compare it to firefly...which I see almost no similarity.To me this show is a mix of Jackie Chan, sin city and Space Sweepers. Extremely corny and B rated. But somehow I feel compelled to keep watching because if the dearth of this type of genre."

adaptor,"Not the anime, but not bad",7/10,19 November 2021,"As a sci-fi western, it was okay. As Cowboy Bebop, it leaves much to be desired. It could have been worse but it could absolutely have been better.Faye and Jet are great, Spike... he's a tough character to cast, I'm sure, but I truly think they could have done better. John Cho is too slow and uncomfortable-looking in the action sequences to be believable. Generally, Jet is Jet, Faye makes the character her own, but Spike is a different character.The overall tone of the show isn't bad and it has some of the feel of anime, some of the feel of Firefly, and some of the feel of (Adam West) Batman, with a dash of Tarantino and Twin Peaks thrown in. Overall, the cinematography and scenes are really well done.I'm happy that this got made, and I'm happy that I watched it. However, I think they missed a huge opportunity to make something great instead of something just good. I hope there's a season 2, though."
PlumBallz,Anime snobs,9/10,20 November 2021,"I was sceptical going in. Watched the death note remake and that was poor. But I loved this. Its a funny sci fi adventure. Too many people are knocking it because they're hung up on the anime. Take it as it is. It's fun.

andersondavidthomas,I'm really conflicted,6/10,19 November 2021,"As a show I wish I would have watched this with no prior nostalgic love of the anime, I would have enjoyed this show much more. I understand that this show is an adaptation that the creators wanted to show us but after episode 6 it just felt uncomfortable. The story felt ever so slightly wrong with the changes made. I don't like a lot of the changes but I think we can count this as something that is not a live action remake that failed. As a show in itself it is good, it's just very weighted down by the idea of being based off one of the greatest animes made. I think the show could benefited from a few more episodes of adventures to create more depth with the new ideas and then to deeper out relationships with the main and side characters.I say watch it if you want to watch an interesting show. But always go for the anime first in this case.

just_funme,"more like 7, but 1 point for effort",8/10,19 November 2021,"I'm not a crazy fanboy of Cowboy Bebop, never got the fuss about it. It was a nice anime and I rewatched it recently, but I've watched better shows than it.So, from someone who thinks the anime was ok, not the untouchable masterpiece diehards think it is, all I can say is the live adaptation was decent. It screws up from time to time with some important details, they modified the stories when they didn't need to, they left out characters probably for their introduction in a second season...BUT. It's still a nice homage to the original and if you pay close attention you'll get some nice scene recreations, like the shadows when Spike fights Pierrot. Small details here and there which take you back and give you an idea of how much love they put into the live adaptation.They recreated the world as close as possible to the anime and I for one am satisfied with it. CGI wise, I've seen some cave trolls complaining, but I doubt they themselves could draw a simple straight line, it's by no means bad, especially for a tv series. The acting was ok, characters on point for the most part, dialogue ....well, not much better than the anime ( again, I've watched it and the lines in the anime are not so earth shatteringly amazing either ). I think that, since they can create their own stories from this point onwards, a second season will give them the chance to bring us closer to the characters, give them a broader background and improve the connection between them.It's not a step-by-step recreation of the original and I see how that might anger some people, I for one expected a continuation to be honest, but it's seriously not as bad as the crazy people make it out to be. If you never seen the anime, it's also a good standalone sci-fi show, so if you like that genre, you should watch it.But would I watch a second season ? Yep, since I always wanted more Cowboy Bebop, so this should satisfy that. Does it deserve a second season ? Yep, since I feel that they showed love to the original material and think they would do a good job moving forward.In conclusion, it's a good show. Watch it."
TheOneThatYouWanted,Just a cow,4/10,9 March 2022,"I can see why this is so hated. The three lead actors are great, but everything else is below average or just plain bad. Bad dialogue, filler like stories but worst of all it is boring most of the time. The original anime is great but far from perfect. This seems like it has they budget but comes off as cheap. This series is forgettable at best.

dschlatter,Something fresh,8/10,30 November 2021,"Sometimes you watch something and it just works for you. You like it with all its faults. Bebop reminds me a little of Firefly. Not the visuals, but some quirks, like how in a sci-fi movie they still use bullets of clunky ""phones"".I just wish, the hardcore fan base could get over their love for the original. Stop trashing this show. Don't be mad, because you've watched this show against your better judgement. That's on you. Me, I adore Back to the Future. If there is ever going to be a re-boot, I'll know what to do: Avoid it like the plague. It could never live up to my expectations. So why don't you do the same?

eclarkdog,Are you entertained?,9/10,24 November 2021,"I've heard of the ""Cowboy Bepop"" anime but never seen it, so this is all new to me. The show seems to be getting very mixed reviews from both critics and viewers.My usual numero uno criteria in gauging the merit of a show is whether I'm entertained. CB seems to be getting knocked for all the same reasons a movie or show gets knocked over the source material. Granted, for me this is all a clean slate, but I can't understand how anyone could not be entertained by this show. I've seen 7 episodes so far and I'd rate it ""binge-worthy"". It's funny, action-packed, extremely violent, great characters - both main and side, and with a touch of drama to boot. Plus, the jazz score is excellent. Oh, and really cute, and smart, pup.I especially like how the show mixes the futuristic with retro stuff. I assume the source was similar in this regard. One minute you are in space or some futuristic setting, and the next your on the streets of New Tijuana or in some neo-noir nightmare. CB is a wonderful genre mish-mish.I've been entertained, have you?Edited 12/17/21: The show is now canceled and I think all these anime CB fans really shot themselves in the foot for all their whining, complaining, and rating dumping. Now we have no more of this great show and universe. Really disappointing."

jamesvass-62316,"Fun, fast, and entertaining.",8/10,26 November 2021,"I went in fresh, I don't know anything about the comic or cartoon or anything like that. The reviews are average, but I loved the old Firefly/Serenity shows so I was attracted to the western meets sci-fi thing. Ok, that acting is a little OTT, but I'm told by my young nephew that this is what the cartoon characters are like. The stories are layered and each episode unfolds a bigger story and explores the characters a little at a time. And the effects and costumes are are weird mix of Art Deco, old world noire, 70's camp, and science fiction. It is just a fun show to watch!

berg-74532,Surprised the rating on here was so high.,8/10,1 January 2022,"I had no confidence they could pull this off shocked when the did but completely unsurprised it was canceled. People, critics pro and wannabe bash the crap out of things just to make up for disappointments in their own lives and Netflix is usually the the center of this nonsense and I'm guessing with time the average score on here will come down with crowd joiners. Women not front and center as pieces of meat three non white leads including a Muslim means all boxes are checked which made me think this was a lock for 5 seasons it also kept me away for a year as I believed that would be the focal point of the show. The show blew past my expectations the ethnicities were not jammed down your throat and the acting was far better than anyone could have anticipated the stories were well thought out the dialogue was as cheezy as it should be while no cheese was wasted. 10 episodes a bunch of morons looking for nits to pick later and another quality shows goes the way of Firefly, not that this was as good but once that loose comparison is made nothing more needs to be said.

uniquename76-690-984242,What if there was no anime,8/10,20 November 2021,"People would be pooping themselves. 10/10 so stylish. 15/10 amazing concepts. Half the problem is the brats and wannabe anime fans voting this show down because it's not animated instead of measuring the show by it's merits.Don't even give me the ""wanted to love this but 2/10"". I LOVE Bebop. I've bought physical copies 4 times. Seen the series 10 times. What is the original anime missing? Can there be more Spike and Jet and Faye and Ein?I don't want the exact anime AGAIN. That already exists. Live action would be a new medium. What can you give me? Off the bat Netflix flexes Dolby Vision and Atmos and spares no expense on the CGI and FX. Which is excellent since hand drawn animes usually don't give you that. The casting choices are excellent. Keeping the spirit of the characters alive.Are the episodes identical? No. And thank you for that. I do not need to see frame by frame remakes of animes. Not do I need Ang Lee Uber arthouse filming.I need fun.I need action.I need goddamn jazz.This series delivers all three and it looks GREAT. I do not get the haters other than they are blindly and stubbornly sticking to the SAME cartoon format for our beloved show and shunning anything else. A very narrow view. As I will eat up any and all Cowboy Bebop you can give me.On its own it's a FUN series. Enjoyable. Are there flaws? Yes. Viscious? Omgah horrendous choice. The worst and most glaring choice of all. Still. Cho and everyone else brings flair and love to the show and I can feel it. Have you noticed the people who have never seen the anime keep giving the show high marks? Even pro critics who never seen CB the anime? Because it's a fun show.I have no interest in idolizing the original and putting it on an untouchable shrine. What for? I love it. I still do. It's been out 20+ years let's do something else.Bottom line I love this and I hope they do Samurai Champloo too. Which is IMHO even better than CB."
HardLight,How this is at nearly 7 is beyond me,1/10,25 November 2021,"Well...not at all beyond me because we all know why it's at 6.7 (currently Nov 21) and its got everything to do with that 86% that's on another movie at another review site that that has been there and static since 2019 that totally 100% represents the feelings and emotions of the users and not something else at all.... *cough*Anyway.Let's get to this trainwreck shall we?From the moment go with this version the fans should've realised what it was, I mean it's Netflix, the last time they tried adapting an anime they got Emo Elliot Roger and his magic notebook.But let's be serious here, they tried to at least present the story in a semi-canonical fashion. Ed is either an hallucination or just pops up right at the end for some reason, but the very ""basic"" plot of the series is there.And all of it is bad.The expressive nature of the Anime is turned into pure cringe, the comedy is done in an absolutely horrendous way with a lack of tonal consistency with the original source material and the acting is - at best - subpar.Add to that the needless drama from ""someone"" on the crew, the seeming lack of care for the story, the frankly arrogant nature of the writers to change key plot elements of characters so that they won't get named as something for including violent governmental overreach with certain people.And honestly a weak prop department (when con goers put more effort into their foam weapons and cardboard bodymods to make things look like they're real, you're scraping a barrel bottom from the other end of the barrel)Then it's not a shock that this is seen by (almost) all people as being the terrible thing it is.Lucky for us though, Netflix has cast the One Piece Crew so we can hope that the bright, colourful, highly action orientated fun world of Oda-Sensei's world is translated well...right?I mean it's not like they could do something like make it entirely wrongfooted, turn the ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT into an allegory for some political end they don't like or something, no! They'd not do that while making the man who needs to hold a sword in his mouth while fighting next to a man made of rubber while another fights with feet and a guy with a long nose who fires from a slingshot and a redhead (not gonna be) who fights with a staff....
look like its trash or anything right?Right?!RIGHT! TELL ME THEY ARENT GOING TO MAKE ANOTHER TRAINWRECK?!"
the_malbogia,"Its not the anime, but thats not a bad thing.",9/10,21 November 2021,"I feel like whenever you make an adaption of something you fall into this super weird space of people wanting it to be something it literally cant be. Whether it be turning a book into a live action, a comic into a cartoon, a video game into a cg movie, you're going to find a big portion of people saying ""its not the same as the original"", and thats not a bad thing to me. Take the original work and do something else with it.I definitely went into this with high hopes, and for me, it did not disappoint. I honestly feel like if I had never seen the original anime, i would have stll fallen in love with this. It captures that whole 'space western' the original anime captured.I enjoyed the visual aesthetics are spot on for a jazzy kickback western. The soundtrack is relaxing smooth jazzy like.I honestly dont understand the complaints on casting. They honestly all feel made for this, especially jet. Honestly never seen the actor before, but he kills Jet. John Cho as spike works. He feels a lil too old for the role, but he doesnt feel wrong. It just feels like he shoulda been given the role 5~10 years ago. The story feels the same as the anime just made live action, so if you didnt like the story before, its not significantly different. The thing I feel was a bit off was the choreography. Its the difference between having an actor do their own stunts and a professional stunt man doing the action. It just feels semi flat. NOT SAYING IT DOESNT WORK, but you can definitely feel the pulled punches, and the dumbing down of choreography so the actors can do it.All that said, no its not the anime. Its a live action adaptation. Fingers crossed they at least finish out the season."
giuliano-iannotta,"Not an anime/manga fan, completely unbiased",9/10,19 November 2021,"Well, my title says it all; haven't read the mangas or seen the anime or whatever (because I'm generally not a fan of the genre) but I thought the trailer looked nice. So I watched three episodes and I'm in love, great actors, unique camera technique and cut, good soundtrack, interesting setting and story. Honestly, this show is one of the best underdogs for me this year! To all the fans out there who are unhappy with that adaptation: I understand you and I see you, but in my honest opinion you should give the showrunners some credit and let them express their freedom with the source material. Try to watch the show from outside your fan goggles and maybe that'll help you.

davevanzundert,I like it!,9/10,20 November 2021,"I liked the anime when I watched it back in the day, enjoyed it from my teenager eyes. I am glad they didn't take the anime to serious and just made a fun live action show out of it. Is it the anime? Nope. Is it Cowboy Bebop? Yes! The music, the special effects, the humor, all spot on!

limpfan106,Solid,8/10,21 November 2021,"I liked it. Some parts were boring, some parts were really good.My main critique: they made the characters more friendly toward each other which makes sense if this show is going to continue, and I actually really liked that change but the end is really faithful to the original and basically undoes all that friendship building. I don't see why they needed to change the formula just to have the end be just as depressing.Still, a solid show and if they make a season 2 it will be great to see the plot go in a new direction. Just please don't make it all about Julia. She is by far the most boring character in the show. No personality at all, just a pretty face and men fight to the end for her based on that.

muthergamer,Awesome Bebop campy fun!!!,9/10,20 November 2021,"If you want cannon Cowboy BeBop watch the anime series for the 1000th time. This Live action series on Netflix CAPTURED the spirit of Cowboy BeBop 100% No it doesn't follow the anime EXACTLY because if they did that it would be friggin' boring and pointless. YES it IS Cowboy. Netflix nailed Bebop's campy bluesy- jazzy sci-fi futuristic FUN! And the STORY is the icing on the cake. I really hope Netflix picks it up for future seasons! Great Job! Kudos Netflix for this refreshing re-telling of an awesome beloved story!

charles-boecher,A Work of Art,10/10,23 November 2021,"I don't like the majority of anime, but I have watched the original. It's amazing, and this version is amazing. This is the best live action remake of any cartoon. People that don't appreciate the jazz, olds car styles, and other stylistic aspects, may not appreciate it.The casting is amazing. My first thought was that the Jet character would be hard to cast for. The actor is amazing. The Spike character casting is amazing.I love everything about it. I think over time people will like it more and more, like red wine or oil paintings.

The chemistry between the cast is good, action/music/dialogs are well written. I liked it.I also read some comments about how it is not like the real series, but c'mon people how could it be the same with original.They did a good work in adapting a great anime, at least till now.

alfstadj,Fanboy Rage,8/10,20 November 2021,"This is not Cowboy Bebop the masterpiece animation. If you came into this expecting it to be you did yourself a huge disservice. I'll admit I was having a bit of this with Faye, but the depiction is growing on me after I shook it off.Almost every sub 7 rating directly compares this to the original. Every so often I get exposed to a 6.4 rated show(Rating at the time of this review) and this is not a 6.4.Hopefully after the fanboys voting on day one are done with it it'll increase to something more reasonable.

Kassdhal,Poor writing,4/10,14 December 2021,"Take a great property with infinite potential, give it to untalented writers with no respect for the IP and complete it with subpar casting choices and you get Netflix Cowboy Bebop: a show with potential but bad execution.From the outset this how was marred in controversies and choices that should have been better thought through
why ever lash out against fans?why cast against type and then be smug about it?why give the writing role to people that are not fan of the original property?why the urge to ""modernise "" something that doesn't need to be?These kinds of controversies work when the underlying product is amazing. And this show isn't.Recipe for a disaster."
KalpeshHemant4,Entertaining and has potential,7/10,26 November 2021,"I went into the series with no prior knowledge on the Japanese neo-noir science fiction.Season 1 is enjoyable and somewhat stylish. The premise interesting, cinematography and visual effects are good too. John Cho is excellent as Spike/Fearless, the fight scenes and choreography stellar. The twists were decent. Mustafa Shakir is great too.Though meandering at times the series gets a 7/10 for all of the above.What doesn't work is the main actress, the love interest: Julia. There is no chemistry between her and any of the cast. Dare I say her acting was subpar and certainly a miscast. Singing not so great either imo. Sorry. As an audience there was no connection to her or her plight. Her partner , the main antagonist, was perfectly cast and played his character well.I also noted the 'city' streets, where the main bar is as well as other 'shops' or places, frustratingly looked like a studio lot.I hope season 2 (if it gets renewed) improves."
NotTheOne000,"Great characters, great stories, great fun",9/10,5 December 2021,"Loved this series, fantastic fun with plenty of noir tropes for genre fans like me, but not laid on so thick that it's nothing more than a reheat of 50s cinema. The characters and acting are great, with the leads excelling and the minor roles slotting in perfectly with their oddball eccentricities adding to the overall feel of the Bebop universe. The relationships feel sparky and genuine, with a real chemistry between the three main protagonists. The cinematography is great, as good as many films, and the effects look amazing throughout. The music track selection is interesting, and is used to accentuate, not create, the mood of the scenes.I understand that many fans of the original do not like the new version of teh original show (which I have not seen). That's fair enough, as I've been in a similar situation myself (Disney Star Wars Universe, I'm looking at you). What I don't understand is the poor reception amongst critics. This is an excellent show, and I would hate a second series to be shelved on the basis of snobbish gate-keeping from critics who are supposed to remain more objective than the Anime's fanboys and fangirls."
hayward-alan,Fun.,8/10,23 November 2021,"The key thing this show gets right is it doesn't take itself too seriously. It understands tone and reincarnates this most pleasing aspect of the original brilliantly. Also has the best brass Ive heard on a soundtrack since Treme which is extremely high praise.

troy-daniel-bush,AN EMBARRASSMENT!!!!!!!!,1/10,29 November 2021,"I cannot believe there are fans of the anime who unironically defend this. I can't believe there are people who defend it at all.Cowboy Bebop is my second favorite show of all time. It's a phenomenal piece of television that does everything right. I am not even a fan of anime and I love it. So yeah, this is personal.I watched the clip where Spike meets Ed on the street and my thoughts towards it were as follows: ""This is as bad as I was expecting."" And, ""That's not Ed.""But I sucked it up and forced myself to watch the first few episodes. I also took it upon myself to watch the Cowboy Bebop movie and the first nine episodes of the anime. It's not often I stop watching something but this pile of crap really did it for me.This is a Last Airbender situation. You have this show that is a work of art and then a live action adaptation is made and it completely butchers everything that made the original great.As I watched this show I was also thinking...""How does anyone write that line and not realize how awful it is?"", ""How does somebody watch this and not speak up?"", ""That's not Spike!"", ""That's not Faye!"", ""That's not Jet!"", ""That's not Vicious!"" The only character they got right was Ein. That is so sad.This action is awful.Why are there so many Dutch angles? This is amateurish!All of the comedy is wince-inducing.I'd like to reference a quote by Adam of YMS, however, I will paraphrase it. ""By making this show you're essentially telling American audiences that they don't need to expand their horizons. There is a world of amazing anime out there that is waiting for people to discover it. The original Cowboy Bebop is something you could show to someone who isn't interested in anime and they will probably love it.""The original Cowboy Bebop is a timeless masterpiece and that a lot of people will not see because of a stigma attached to anime and because a lot of people don't like foreign cinema.If you like this, great. But you can threaten me with death and you will not get me to agree with you that this show is any good. Because let me reiterate, as far as I'm concerned, once again, referencing YMS but paraphrasing: This show is a crime against filmmaking.This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. I think it's the worst adaption of an anime ever conceived."
oussamaarroud,Lol 9/10 of the negative reviews are from the anime fans,10/10,20 November 2021,"With that being said. I loved this show. I've tried watching the anime 3 times before but couldn't get past episode 2. But this show made me binge it in one go. I love the actors chosen for the parts. The music is tiptop. The cgi was looking very good. And i loved how everything was shoot tbh. Overall I loved this show more than the first 2 episodes of the anime.

kevinmiller-55959,Great tv,10/10,19 November 2021,"It's not perfect, but then name a tv show that's well loved that's perfect!I can pick worse holes in shows bigger than this, yet people are dragging this, crazy!John Cho looks exactly like spike, and his acting is top notch.Everyone else is fine, they suit and are wacky enough to fit in with the mixture of live action and what the anime was.The only criticism I have is vicious, who isn't at all like the anime, like not even a little bit. You'll have to watch it to get it but yeah, he's a good villain, but the anime version was truly terrifying in comparison. Maybe this take just works better with live action who knows.Anyway, the people who bang on about being true to the source material and rate this so low probably gave shows like titans a 10/10, so ignore them and watch this and have some fun!Lighten up you purists 😂"
tqmybbwr,Love it!,2/10,19 November 2021,"I love sci fi and this is amazing! I'm familiar with the original and I'm getting the same vibe. In a live action it's important to capture the vibe and some resemblance to the characters which we get. There's no such thing as a perfect adaptation to the original if you're expecting to get a perfect ORIGINAL adaptation lol so people rating it low expecting it to be this perfect thing conceived in their mind are very naive. Hell, even people rating it not knowing what the anime is and vibe is shouldn't probably be rating it cus they don't like the vibe or music or whatever. It messes with the integrity of the rating and how you should review a show, especially an adaptation.

I can go on playing this up and I've loved the original series since saw it 20 years ago.Netflix can go to hell. Netflix is canceled. So many other streaming services, they have a big opportunity to pick this up.

BronnFlakes,"Lower your expectations, don't expect a shot-for-shot remake, and have an open mind.",8/10,21 November 2021,"As long as you're a fan of the original and you go in with tempered expectations and know that they ARE going to change/condense stuff because it's 10 episodes rather than 26, it's really not that bad. People are also upset that they changed the plot a bit. What, were you hoping for a shot for shot remake of the original? What would even be the point in doing that? If people cherish the original so much that they just want to see the same scenes all over again, they're certainly free to go back and watch it again.I appreciate that they changed the story up a bit, though I'm a bit lukewarm on the final 10-15 minutes of the finale. Still, it's obvious that they wanted to set this up to continue as a new series that tells new stories for those who are interested. If that's not you, then, I don't know what to tell you. Go back and watch the anime?As far as the production goes, it was decent for a Netflix show. Some stuff was hokey and I probably would have gone with a younger actor than John Cho for Spike, but he does a good job in the role despite his age. The rest of the cast are more or less average/good (but not great), and the CGI and set pieces are pretty good. The space scenes in particular are pretty nice to look at.So, yeah, go in with an open mind and lower your expectations. Don't go in thinking, OR wanting, a shot for shot remake and you'll probably at least be moderately entertained. The live action Cowboy Bebop is by no means exceptional, but it's still a fun watch overall."
marshalsea-547-992254,Not Perfect But Better Than Most Live Action Adaptions,7/10,20 November 2021,"As one of the original CB fans, having watched this first time round, fan subbed, and waiting for the last few episodes to arrive, I still rate 20 years later that Cowboy Bebop is the best anime series released. Great culturally referenced stories, acceptable levels of fan service, and that soundtrack... all the things most anime fall foul.So ignore the whiners and come along for the ride - it's not perfect, it's a beaten up barely hanging together rickety ride, but hell - what's more Cowboy Bebop than that?So first up... it got the music spot on... well... how could you get it wrong when you get the original seminal work of The Seatbelts. A 20 year old OST that sounds as fresh as ever, and probably the most responsible thing for getting people into Jazz in the last 20 years.The writing? It's not perfect, it is however respectful and doesn't fall foul to the usual ""I'm a raving narcissistic idiot who thinks they can out-write a well loved series"", and does an awful lot within this space - bravo! The writers do however nail the humour, absolutely spot on - so for all the not perfect this gets the writers a huuuuuge thumbs up, to nail something as intrinsic and ethereal as the bizarre humour of Cowboy Bebop is a major win. A little bit too much of the ""now trendy gender"" writing that will age badly and date this, that the anime completely avoided.Their major fail is the whole Julia/Vicious thread, totally wrong - losing all the mystery that keeps you hooked in.Casting - this is where it comes a bit unstuck. Where John Cho and Mustafa Shakir absolutely nail it - all the worries over the casting of Daniella Pineda are confirmed - she and/or the writers have not handled Faye at all well, and she comes across as unlikeable and whiny instead of no-nonsense, massively angry, snipey and selfish Faye, I suspect she hasn't done any research of watching the anime or just doesn't have it in her personality. Now... I'll temper this with Daniella does have her moments and you think ""THIS!!! MORE OF THIS!!!"". Come on, get this nailed for the next series and prove all the nay-sayers that it's the right casting!The other massive miscasting/writing is Vicious - he's gone from a genuine nasty piece of work in the anime to a bit of a butt of jokes at times - the Hassel gurns his way through every scene. It's really weird as he's a fantastic actor elsewhere.On the other great casting is obviously Ein... heart melted, just not enough of him; and Mason Alexander Park as Gren, every time they're on screen they steal it, much like their anime counterpart.Art Direction - HOLY HELL!!! These peeps deserve a medal, they've totally nailed it, the outfits, the locations, the sfx... wow.A major weirdness that will no doubt be talked over is there's a weird filter/lack of over everything that just makes everything look cheaper. Than it obviously is."
NellaMarieDudova,You All Argued John Cho Was Too Old!,7/10,29 November 2021,"John Cho managed to do such an excellent job as Spike. I mean, none of us argued that John Cho wasn't going to do a good job, right? Right?! Without spoiling anything substantial, I was pleased to see the adaptation be changed to fit into a live-action. Unfortunately, some of the decisions made by the production team and all to NOT alter some of the very goofy things and character traits to fit a live-action adaptation were strange to me. Why change one thing but not another? I guess that will forever be the question. Overall, I loved the cinematography, and I bow down to the stunt coordinators and stunt people for doing a great job because I do not think I've seen much better overall fight scenes in a while. VFX peeps, I didn't forget you! You've clearly done your fair share of magic!

danbull-20427,Ok for a Sunday afternoon with nothing else to watch,6/10,2 January 2022,"Despite previous review about Netflix aiming for those with a low IQ, which is the exact sort of pretentious drivel those with a low IQ say about others as their IQ is to low to realise their own failings, this is not that bad.Yes it's not going to revolutionise your thoughts on cinema. Mustafa is not enough for this role however John Cho and Daniella Pineda bring an easy fun to their roles, which is enjoyable to watch.It definitely is not worthy of any higher rating than a six but then it doesn't have to be brilliant to be fun and enjoyable.If you've nothing better to do on a wet Sunday afternoon this will fill the gap nicely.

fraser-simons,"Just can't get into it, after multiple tries",4/10,8 November 2022,"I really wanted to like this. I like the aesthetic, even the jarring jump cuts, after a while. But I just kept finding myself not caring what happened next. A problem the original certainly does not have. The acting is pretty uneven, in a way the anime gets a pass for because it's down to voice acting and falls back on incredible animation. This solely relies on actors and I don't think they're capable of embodying a compelling feel. You see this a lot with shows that have a lot of green screen going on. People are in a haze without exceptional direction, and as of the first four episodes, it just doesn't feel like a cohesive end product.And I have already seen what's happening on screen via the anime, so who is this really for? People who haven't ever seen it and want the same thing repackaged, I guess? Well, that isn't me, apparently.

obenhuberr,Not quite right...cosplay,6/10,22 November 2021,"Um, i have been in love with this anime forever. I also feel that way about Ghost In The Shell. Sorry to say it is almost impossible to do anime in a live action format. How characters look. How characters speak. How characters behave and interact. These are critical. All of the characters did not look at all like the anime characters, so for myself i could not really see Spike or Jet, or Faye. Jet was from Ganymede he was not a black gentleman ( i wish they had found a Ganymedian for that role), Faye was chinese sort of (amnesia) not latino, and VER ver sexy. Spike was the HOT toxic male. Faye was the HOT toxic female. Jet was the protective grandpa. Cosplay. That is how it seemed...cosplay, not real characters. Again, just my take.

cherold,"Probably okay if you haven't seen the anime, in which case, watch the anime",6/10,13 December 2021,"I still remember (vaguely) the first time I saw the anime series Cowboy Bebop. There was this scraggly guy who was as cool as Humphrey Bogart who fought like Jet Li and there were other cool people and jazz and stylish animation and this super annoying kid whose inclusion was the one real mistake of the series. It was one of the first anime series I had seen, and one of the best I've seen to this day.I also remember seeing (more recently) the trailer for the title sequence for the live action Bebop, which exactly emulated the anime title sequence, and thinking, I hope they know you can't just use the language of anime for live action.But they don't know that. The first episode slavishly devotes itself to copying the look of the old series. Which might work if they could also emulate the cool.The first thing to note is the likable John Cho's version of Spike is a poor substitute for the cool, scraggly, pain-hidden-deep-inside Spike of the original. Likewise, Daniella Pena's Faye just lacks whatever made cartoon Faye so engaging. While Mustafa Shakir makes a decent Jet Black, the weak casting is a serious issue.The action was pretty good, but lacked the woah factor I recall from old Bebop. And this is ultimately the issue with this version; there's no woah factor. Everything's pretty decent, but there's nothing that makes me feel - as I did after one episode of anime Bebop - oh my God I have to watch this.In conclusion, if you haven't seen the anime, watch it."
wang-01639,"Hello, my name is...",3/10,24 November 2021,"Ridiculous casting decisions.I was skeptical about the casting of Jet and Spike.John Cho and Mustafa Shakira actually nail their parts, cosmetic dissimilarities aside. You know they are familiar with the original anime and succeed bringing that to their parts.Now to the absolute ridiculous casting of Faye and Vicious. Pineda cast as Faye is completely incorrect for the role. She makes no attempt to even try and pull off the role. Pineda is playing Pineda. What she thinks its a wacky, great interpretation of Faye completely misses the mark. Really destroys the flow of the series As well as being in insult to the original. Terrible actress to boot.Vicious -What the hell were they thinking? This interpretation is the opposite of Vicious. Uncertain, anxious and weird, not intimidating. The guy is hammy. Another massive casting failure. Not to mention he looks wall-eyed."
tvlongz,Best Anime Live Action Adaptation,8/10,20 November 2021,"Casting, Sets, Music & the feel of the show are perfect.Vicious the main villian was alittle over the top, too cartoony.The writing also needs to be cleaned up alittle.Good start to better live action anime adaptations.

I don like how the one- or two-ers still come up with their criticism! It may all not be on par with the original anime, but I do not care. The show has a fantastic design: I saw even a crt-monitor: a great idea! It is obvious a pastiche of the anime, but very well done. Al the acting is just fine and John Cho is great. Must force myself not to binge-watch. Every episode is worth looking twice.

laubepiotr,The best series since Gotham,9/10,22 November 2021,"I did not know the Manga origin and this is maybe why I am totally enchanted by this series. It has everything than you would expect from an mix of Space Opera with some Tarantino element. Characters are great, the wit is there and it is actually funny, the CGI is amazing blending earth landscape with futuristic enclaves somewhere in our Galaxy. It is a pure joy, don't expect logic - just sit down turn up the sound and listen to the lovely Jazz Bebop. Can't wait for second series.

mattbrady67,Anime is one of my favorites,9/10,20 November 2021,"The original anime is easily in my top 5 and I still really love this. Do I have some nit picks. Yeah, but you almost never come across perfection in anything in life. As most people have complained I don't like who they cast as viscous. Not sure yet if it's casting or what the director/script gave the actor to work with, or maybe all three tbh. But something about him just wasn't right. Other than that I'm loving it so far. Most of the changes make sense, it's got some scenes ripped right out of the anime and makes some other changes to keep it fresh. Probably the best anime to tv adaptation I've personally seen. I technically give this an 8 I just wanted to offset some of the hate from people that expect some exact carbon copy of what they've seen 100 times.

randall_fire,"The Bebop vibes are there, with enough changes but not too many.",8/10,20 November 2021,"I don't do ""comparing."" I've seen too many people lose their minds over how The Lord of the Rings suddenly had a female elf in them! Gasp! Or Dune being ""unfilmable."" Or anything that ""proves"" that you're a real fan, and nothing new can't possibly be good. Keep an open mind and give something new a chance please.So that being said, I just binged the anime again a week before seeing the live version, and I must say: I like it, for the most part. I think the actors are doing well, the writing is for the most part good, and they follow the source material, but with some changes to keep it refreshing.I don't really like Lucius Malfoy (no, not Jason Isaacs. You'll see what I mean) as Vicious. The acting there is weird and he just makes me cringe/laugh. In some places the use of.the wide angle lens is also a bit strange. And in the first two spisodes, it looks as if they're still finding their way. But that's all the bad I have to say here.The acting is good enough, the humour is on par, the effects are really good, the music is great as it should be, the characters are as loveable as they should be, the fighting scenes are fun (though sometimes they look a bit too rehearsed) and in the end, you just had a fun time watching.I'm a fan of the anime, but face it: all the fans wanted more. Well here it is, after many years. Is it perfect? No. But don't hate me for saying this: neither was the anime. I had a blast watching both though, and I sincerely hope it won't stop after one season just because some close-minded people can't handle that. Faye's boobs are a bit smaller (seriously! I have seen this as a complaint!), or that Spike's hair isn't green and doesn't look like it just got out of a tumble dryer, to name but two things. Who cares about that??What I care about is having watching something like this. And that is exactly what Cowboy Bebop does."
nrgigaba,Watch It With New Eyes,5/10,20 November 2021,"Whenever Netflix announces an anime live-action production, fans cringe because they have constantly failed to produce something worthy of the original source material. Firstly the exaggeration in anime make it hard to be executed by people and secondly the casting has always been bad in anime live actions.Cowboy Bebop has a cult following which expends beyond anime lovers, so the bar was always going to be high for this one. Old and new Cowboy Bebop fans will be watching this frame after frame, cast mannerisms and listening to every word with scrutiny.This has been honestly the best anime live action from Netflix, emphasis on ""anime"" because we got the amazing 'The Old Guard, Sweet Tooth and The Witcher' which are comic book adapted live actions. But the horrible after taste left by the 'Death Note' has not been removed by this series.When watching this watch it with an open mind and try putting every memory of the series you've got behind your mind. John Cho (Spike), Mustafa Shakir (Jet) and Daniella Pineda (Faye) are just good at their roles but when you wanna compare it to the anime you'll hate this.Remember: ""Comparison is a stealer of joy"" allow yourself to enjoy this series for what it is without constantly trying to compare it to the original anime.I wish this does get a second season because I think their biggest challenge yet will be Eddie's character and I for one wanna see how they are going to deal with that."

lumiens,I Hated It At First,7/10,23 November 2021,"I have BluRay/DVD of this anime. I've watched the episodes over and over. I put Cowboy Bebop up there with Samurai Champloo, Ghost in the Machine, Dororo, Akira, the list goes on. I only watched the live action show to make fun of Netflix's effort...and boy I did - at the beginning.I disliked the wooden acting, the telegraphed choreography, the character changes (I dislike pandering...why not follow the vision of the original creator?), etc. However, things came together soon enough and, by episode 5, I recognized that this was an awesome creation in and of itself.Even a couple of my teenagers decided to watch it with me. They weren't going to, but they saw me laughing and decided to see what all the hubbub was about. Still, it's hard to watch a show when you know where it ends up.It's a melancholic exercise. Don't give up on this, folks. Consider it as an alternate universe of the original...a re-imagining... with some different characters/story-lines to keep things interesting for the old-schoolers...sometimes very different."
florianperini,Can't wait for season 2,10/10,21 November 2021,"Agreed. It's a bit different than the original Manga series but it is its own piece of art. The characters, environments, dialogues and the music are really well set and frigging entertaining.I binged it and very much enjoyed the ride. Can't wait for season 2 and am hopeful that there are many more to come.

Blumanowar,Very entertaining but Netflix is...,7/10,31 December 2021,"Very entertaining but Netflix is...Or has had an incredibly disappointing holiday fare. They had no great new shows and they cancel ones that show promise. Netflix is losing its edge. They won't even give a show a second season to prove their case. Had JBO based the same ideas on GOT a great show would have been cancelled before it got out of the gates. I didn't care for GOT the first season.Prime had much better fare released and while I've been a long time Netflix supporter and stock owner it's been a disappointing last 3 years. Period. The only decent shows are for adolescents. I guess it's going to cater to the teenage crowd while prime clearly has more adult entertainment. Ashame too.

wilwilliamharris,A solid enjoyable watch,7/10,20 November 2021,"This show isn't the anime, but is definitely enjoyable all on its own. The casting is great. The sets and music really captures the spirit of the original.

loozzotys,not bad not great,5/10,29 December 2021,"Some great action some bad action
some good CGI some really bad CGI
Some good jokes some flat jokes
a missed opportunity to be great
Some scenes so flat boring
some scenes are good
mostly mediocre jokes though. The episodes could be half the time run to make it more better paced because some really flat scenes.

mindlessmoviemaster,Netflix was right to cancel this.,1/10,11 December 2021,Why can't they just do it right it's not that hard. Glad they canceled it before they ruined even more of this show. Why can't they just do a faithful adaptation? Notice all the Tens are from bot accounts with one or two reviews. Anyways thanks byeeee!
Hazu29,Almost watchable if it wasn't for...,1/10,21 November 2021,"Daniella Pineda ruined the show. I know for a fact it was not the writers idea to change so much about Faye character, the actress made demands and they complied. Wardrobe, character personality, sexuality, etc. Basically, she's not Faye, that's another character completely different. Faye is a badass action girl, the ""Faye"" from this show is a comedian wannabe trying to be cool and 100% Hollywood. It's a disgrace. They also messed up Ed, but I won't bother with that one. The rest of the cast is okay, nothing special. It just looks like a parody made by amateur cosplayers. Unwatchable for real Cowboy Bebop fans."
koonibert,"Solid, well made Adaption by people who really dug into the material",8/10,19 November 2021,"I watched the first few episodes today and I am very happy with this adaption.You can see that a lot of careful thoughts went into making this and I appreciate that. The world building is great and the acting works well too.If you like futuristic stuff or better yet, if you're a fan of the original I think you will be pretty pleased.

residentgrigo,A bad adventure show and a worse adaptation,3/10,19 November 2021,"The just-concluded 5 part Rurouni Kenshin film series is very well done and there have been a few other live-action adaptations worth watching (often period pieces). Even Old Boy is loosely based on a manga. Yet Japan itself is failing to do manga & anime justice 98% of the time so what hope is there for foreign productions? This most recent US stillbirth is a giant waste of time and feels and looks like an ""ascended"" fan project. Who knew that being stuck in development hell for close to 2 decades is bad for projects? The badly cast actors, NONE of them work, also fail to engage and the sets and CG look fake in nearly all shots. Worst of all is the editing. The actors can´t live up to the energetic original so editing or direction ""tricks"" and endless reprisals of the original score are used to bridge the gap even if the choices rarely fit. Don´t get me started how badly lit and shot most of this is. I couldn´t bring myself to suffer through 10 eps. The bad manga and game adaptations might have been a sign that Cowboy Bebop´s magic can´t be repeated. We now know for sure so don't even bother. (Re)watch the original instead as that will take about the same time as this. Nearly all cases there are all killer no filler and often continuity-free. This Frankenstein monster makes them twice a long, connects them for no reason and fails to do anything right in the process. I can´t believe that Christopher Yost is one of the main people who inflicted this on us.The failed Death Note 2017 at least works as a trashy 90s teen film. I will admit that worse US adaptations of Japanese material exist but how is it noticeably worse than US Death Note? This sad production is at least better than the truly hateworthy Ghost in the Shell 2017 so I ""award"" one point more. Good luck with One Piece and Yu Yu Hakusho Netflix...Update: I finished clicking through the rest of the show and the pilot ended up being the best episode by the looks of it. S1 of hopefully 1 is offensively bad. This will launch a million YouTube takedowns! I have to drop my review by a point as what I sampled is worthy of outright hatred. Especially ep 9. A full episode flashback into Spike´s mafia past with all the actors being middle-aged so laughable wigs are put on the trio to make them look young. (Spike becomes a bounty hunter at age 24 in the anime and is 27 in the main show + film). And poor Pierrot Le Fou. The original´s best ep, a haunting Batman homage as Bebop´s team also worked on Batman TAS, now reduced to gutter trash where he is a direct-to-video freak show monster side act. I would need to be paid money to finish this for real. Not quite Dragon Ball Evolution or Devilman 2004 bad still one of the worst ""adaptations"" of Japanese media of all time. 2021 Vicious, now a main character in EVERY ep, might lastly be the worst main villain in such media. Respect."
akinu-78962,Not the animation...buuuut,10/10,19 November 2021,"You can see the love added into this series, saw many anime to live action across the years and i can say that this series can join a very exclusive club (rurouni kenshin the other candidate) of good quality cross-overs.However, the anime is too dear to my heart...making it impossibke to go over the 7/10 mark.

nyxnightbird,Remember watching the show years back,8/10,21 November 2021,"I enjoyed this. I think people are comparing the two unfairly, which is why things dont do as well as fans are so rigid and unwavering and wont let anything be changed as if the original is sacred. I enjoyed this for what it was, loved the cast and it was fairly humorous. Give a go if your open minded and willing to see past one thing.

jonwake-22302,"Loved it, probably live action anime by Hollywood",8/10,19 November 2021,"I always thought Cowboy Bebop could have a live action series, space westerns aren't new, look at 'Firefly'. And seeing how Guardians of the Galaxy was made, why not... No doubt this was going to divide critics and fans, from a fan of the anime myself. This was a really good live action series, enjoyed it from start to finish, stayed true to the key parts from the anime but also new stuff actually worked really well. The cast was brilliant, John Cho and Mustafa Shakir and Daniella Pineda pulled off their characters brilliantly... action scenes were okay could have been better, hope they they improve on that. Yoko Kanno's score great as always.Overall it was good and enjoyable, I prefer the anime, but credit to the production team and Netflix they did a good job."
orangejuice-99091,10 For the hater,10/10,2 December 2021,"I felt compelled after 7 episodes in to write this...For all of the hate this show gets...I love it. I thought maybe I'd hate it too, but I gave it a chance and am having a lot of fun escaping into this entertainingly cool world. This show has won me over for what it is. It has heart. Don't tell my inner cynic, but my kid at heart loves it. Heck even my inner cynic has warmed up to these characters. Call me a pushover, but hey, at least I feel happy and have fun when watching this live action version of Cowboy Bebop.

TheTruthofItIs,And that's a pass,2/10,7 December 2021,"Cowboy Bebop (S01, 10 eps, 45-min, Netflix) is such a huge disappointment that I couldn't even get past the second ep. It gets an extra star for its production values, but everything else is a bad miss: casting is horrible beginning with John Cho as the lead, he'll always be a side-kick, secondary actor, he just doesn't have the gravitas to lead; the annoying jazz music that allows for no other music style/type at all - how 'bout diversity for music! And episodes just end flat, no hook, no enticement to watch the next, it's just a very very poor effort. Update 12/9/21: Nailed it! Netflix cancelled after only one season due to dwindling viewership/interest.

ajneeago96,4 Stars out of 5 Stars,8/10,20 December 2021,"Look, I've never seen the original anime, nor do I think I really needed to see it to experience and appreciate this live action adaptation. While I think it's a wonderful, awesome series, im also the same person that thinks the live action death note film was good too... so you angry anime fanboys, don't @me, idc lmao. What a disappointment to hear this wonderful series is already canceled. Why Netflix expects people to keep watching their shows if they keep getting axed is beyond me. Regarding the bad reception this got, simply put: people have expectations that will never be met.. like ever. What's wrong with just enjoying something? I dug this a lot! The special effects are pretty amazing. Possibly some of the best CGI I've seen from a Netflix show thus far (although I haven't seen much). The characters were wacky, fun, and ever interesting. The score was very much a vibe; jazzy as all hell. The direction/cinematography/choreography was this shows greatest feat. So damn stylish, high-octane stuff. John M Cho plays a damn likable character Spike/Fearless who works as a bounty hunter with his buddies Jet and Faye. This ended on a huge cliffhanger so obviously if this never gets renewed, I'll always have beef with Netflix."
farrukhx-26124,It's really an 8,10/10,20 November 2021,"If, like me, you've never seen the anime, then the show is entertaining and enjoyable. I've given it a 10 to try and raise the average due to the bashings from some incredibly weird people but it is a solid 8 for me.A lot of reviews are comparing to a cartoon they watched years ago and need to really get over it as this clearly isn't a show that's as low as what they've rated it and should look at things objectively.

charles-limcw,Actually Good and Very Enjoyable in Itself,7/10,10 December 2021,"I only watched it to see how bad it was given all the sniping about it. Lo and behold I enjoyed it!Guess the trick is to watch it for itself without having a clue what the animated series was about.I have no issue at all with the casting - all felt naturally befitting their roles. The restrained vibey music was great.Fun (though tad too violent for my liking), well produced and interesting without being smart-alecky convoluted, nor taking itself overly seriously.I'll be watching the animated series (which I've not seen) and see what the big fuss purists have been kicking up. Though I concur that the west have totally screwed up the likes of Death Note and Old Boy.Too bad Netflix has cancelled it after just one season.But do kick back and flow with this one season!"
kegebler,You totally missed the Cadence of what was Cowboy Bebop!,5/10,31 December 2021,"You're casting was immaculate however the direction and Cadence was totally missed. Cowboy Bebop has a Cadence of super brutal making you cry versus making you hate somebody completely. This series seems to emit a lot of that not being able to catch the character and overall hierarchy of garbage. There are many episodes you are not putting in that are pivotal meaning the first episode in the Animated Series completely time Spike Spiegel 2 Julia and The Syndicate. The rest of the story telling almost means to me that the director skimmed Cowboy Bebop and never was never able really connect to the completely Canon episodes to some forced information we have to have boo. I understand why this was canceled just not good direction you guys left out everything great in simplified and put in everything that was overstory reason you wanted to Force and just not following the main story boo.

Muxje,Worthy homage to the original.,7/10,21 November 2021,"It's not that easy to do a live action version of a comic, and that goes double for anime. If you're after a faithful recreation of a beloved series, you'll probably be disappointed. It's a different medium, and what works in ink doesn't necessarily work with real actors.So: the Netflix version of Cowboy Bebop is not a recreation, but a worthy homage to the original. That's as good as it's ever going to get... and that's fine. An over-the-top, beautifully made production with a crazy energy.An acquired taste to be sure, and it's not for everyone. My advice, whether you're a fan of the original anime or not: ignore the overly positive or negative reviews, and just watch an episode or two, that should settle it.

Nyc_Don_DrKing,I mean THEY TRIED....is all I can Say,3/10,17 December 2021,"Look it's not as horrid as it's being made out to be, but as a hard fan of the anime which was my 1st introduction back in 2000, I'm sure it came out maybe 1-2 yrs before that. There's just certain anime you don't ATTEMPT to adapt to live action. Matter of fact there is A TON of anime you don't adapt to live action period. ""IT IS THE VERY REASON WHY IT IS AN ANIME""..let the classic be just that, a classic. It is very rare to get a accurate or at the minimum a decent adaptation of a anime classic. HOLLYWEIRD just won't learn, especially these streaming sites. Just because comicbook films & anime is what's on fire right now doesn't mean everything will be. This isn't on the actors solely, the writers n director failed this one heavily.

bgar-80932,Entertaining,7/10,19 December 2021,"I never watched the anime so I didn't automatically hate it like some. I could have seen it being renewed or canceled, it was a decent entertaining show. I liked Spike alot and Vicious was a pretty good villain. The writing was only so-so though. The action was really fun. The end was pretty dumb, makes no sense how Spike lived, I wish they would have just let him die there but they thought there'd be another season I guess."

chefseanaz,And... cancelled after one season.,2/10,10 December 2021,If the idiots at netflix and whoever casted this would have stayed true to the Anime this would have been a wonderful adaption. This was obviously made by people who didn't care about the anime. Or even watched it.
safods,3..2..1..lets jam.,7/10,19 November 2021,"I'm a sucker for good sci-fi and this show is that. The production value is top notch, those saying the sfx are bad makes me wonder what show they actually watched.The camera and editing work is also good and the music composed by Yoko Kanno and played by the Seatbelts -I had to look them up as I will need more of this jam in my music life - is of the hook.The main cast has great chemistry and nobody falls through, the only character that started to annoy me a bit was Vicious. Not that Alex Hassell is a bad actor, Vicious just felt a bit onesided. I binged all ten episodes in one sitting and was not bored(the second to last episode does drag a little bit). I liked the silly slightly over the top feel of it all, kinda reminded me of The fifth element without getting quite so silly.The last episode had me sitting feeling slightly depressed thinking no....nonono it cant end like this, and then the very last scene completely flipped that. Made me laugh and smile and right there and then I was ready for another season with the cowboys and a dog."
tourach-95769,Pretty bad,4/10,7 May 2022,"The directing and story I feel are pretty bad. I actually didn't hate John cho in the lead like many others. This just didn't translate well to live action and the vision they had for it didn't work at all and came off a cheesy.

speiglewill,The effort has room for future potential,7/10,20 November 2021,"Looks great and has a certain quirky spirit that the anime had. I like the story divergence from doing exactly what has been done before. Since these are real actors, it makes sense that there needs to be a little humanity to them. Vicious is the only disappointing character so far, in that the live action version contradicts what made the animated version so scary and methodical. The Vicious here is a spoiled, impulsive brat that can't be taken seriously nor respected. I'm glad that they made room for more seasons since there needs to be a better connection with the characters and so that the actors have more time to biild their chemistry with each other. I would've liked a bit more fun with certain aspects, however overall I like the direction that this is going. Also, this far better done than those insulting live action Deathnote and Attack On Titan films were.

kissalbums,"Without Julia & Vicious, this would be a 10",9/10,27 August 2023,"A Fresh reboot that deserved a Second Season. They did an admirable job with Casting & there definitely is Chemistry between Jet, Spike & Faye. Any scene where one of the main three characters is on screen works, and is quite enjoyable.John Cho channels Spike with a perfect blend of Cool & Aloofness. Daniella Pineda holds her own as Faye. She ads a refreshing take to the character, while toning down some of the two dimensional emphasis on sexuality that was present in the Anime. Mustafa Shakir does an excellent job as Jet. The addition of a family to his backstory works well and coincides with the Paternal instincts that he showed in the Anime.The only drawback is the over emphasis of Vicious & Julia. Alex Hassell is an overacting Ham who makes almost all of his scenes unwatchable. Elena Satine ads an edge to Julia which was not present in the Anime.It is worth a watch & stands on its own .......Hopefully a Live Action Move will come soon!!!!"
Pairic,"Good ""Villains"".",7/10,12 December 2021,"A bit difficult to get into, effects aren't always great but acting is good. The retro setting is confusing and I had to go to the Anime source material for an explanation for the diaspora from Earth. Good ""villains"", everything is relative here. After a few episodes I sort of took to it. And so the end. After 10 episodes I have a sneaking regard for it. Spike's backstory is fully revealed in episode 9 but it still lacks an info dump about the catastrophe on Earth. A goodish bounty hunters series. Sadly it's cancelled after one season. 7/10.

james_scott_mcs,Fan of the Anime and of fan of this version.,10/10,23 November 2021,"As a fan of the anime, I was glad to see they didn't do a frame by frame cosplaying remake. Yes the characters aren't perfect clones of the anime, but there isn't one that you don't instantly recognize. And they all do a great job at playing their part.Now the story. They took the original, yanked out all of the origin stuff twisted parts around and made it into the first 10 episodes. While it is essentially the same overall. There are numerous changes which keep it fresh and unique enough to fans of the original (like me) interested. Even if they saw the original 10+ times. And honestly, in a lot of ways, I prefer the Spike-Vicious-Julia storyline in this version. Maybe people are mad because all of the ""fun"" episodes from the anime's first half aren't in these ten episodes. But instead they concentrate on telling (and expanding on) the main cast's background.Sets and filming. Now here is where I would take away point for the lack of space and ships. While there are scenes with ships and space, it is mere fraction of what was in the anime. But, when they do, they look picture perfect. From the Bebop to Faye's and Spike's small fighters, they look spot on. But where they lack on space scenes, the city scenes knock it out of the park. I also found the Noir style really captured the feel of the anime.One of the elephants in the room was some changes that needed to be made. There were some subject matters and costumes (most notably Faye's) the had to be changed. In the 20 years since the original a lot of things are no longer sociably as acceptable. But thankfully the changes they made were subtle and really didn't detract from the story.Overall it is a great series in it's own right, that uses the anime as source material and not as a script."
hafaball-1,Fun but misses on many marks,5/10,22 November 2021,"""See You Space Cowboy..."" is shown at the end of 4 out of the 5 episodes I've seen so far and that's quite presumptuous of the writers, assuming we WILL be back to watch a mediocre adaptation of Cowboy Bebop, the beloved classic nearly perfect jazz space tragedy of the late 90's. I was willing to give the show the benefit of the doubt, but even in the trailers they couldn't help themselves and remade characters, plots, even nearly the whole 1st episode of the anime. For some reason, coming up with new stories was just too much trouble, which was masterfully done in the 2001 Cowboy Bebop animated movie.Even when they do come up with new stories, each episode feels the need to extend the runtime to 45+ minutes (possibly the fault of Netflix), doubling that of one anime episode. Meaning by the time the Netflix episode is halfway over, we'd be done with the anime, which somehow conveys more information, emotion, action and better humor than an overlong slog of a scene the live action version seems to do. It reminds me of the new Twilight Zone, each double the length of the 1950's show, with less going for it and the message wondering away.This fault lies heavily on the bewildering decision to overly show the monotonous syndicate scenes (I won't go into this Vicious ""The Chin"" version) which have added nothing so far and the removal of the slick beautiful neo-noir feel in favor of more energetic Scott Pilgrim-esque or a less funny pseudo-Edgar Wright gags. Also the strange decision Hollywood continues to make that dutch angles means cartoon or comic book, when the cinematography of Cowboy Bebop made it so skillfully beautiful that it was the first for many to walk the line of ""just a cartoon"" to a real work of art. Maybe instead of Cowboy Bebop they should have remade the wackier ""Outlaw Star""?The huge pluses are of course the music, wisely picked for their scenes, though I'm not sure I've heard anything new by Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts, but I could be wrong. The action is great, though the fight scenes seem slow and overly choreographed, that's unfortunately due to the live action vs. The watery flow of Spike's animated fight style. And the main cast has been fun to watch, John Cho is really good even if he's not quintessential Spike, he seems to combine Spike and Shunsaku Kudo, the character from Detective Story whom Spike is based on. A lot of people have commented he's too old, I don't see it. Faye is annoying, but she's supposed to be (as long as it's not all the time) and Jet is Jet...really, Mustafa Shakir is that good. I loved him in ""Quarry"" and now this.Overall, it's nice to hope maybe kids today will watch this and then watch the original series if they haven't, but it's kind of like the new Ghostbusters or Star Wars films... did this really need to happen?"
erin-34031,Live version of an Anime that was so underrated,9/10,19 November 2021,"I am the first episode in. I can tell you this... the anime had jazz music, guns, space, blood and gore. To the ones complaining about the jazz music making it seem off or jarring obviously didnt see the anime. John Cho is the perfect casting for Spike, from his unique style hair, aside from the greenish tint the hair had in the anime; he's exactly how I imagined him to be. Jets relatively close as well. As far as I can tell, the first episode is the first episode from the anime. Everything is the same from the anime. The opening and the episode title is even the same. Its very difficult to take an anime and turn it into live action. They cant even turn video games into live action correctly. This is the closest anyone could get. The director did their research.The only difference is Faye was more bustier in the chest in the anime. The actress while not as busty, she is very close in resemblance. I'd also point out you dont see Faye until the 3rd episode in the anime and this you see her in the first. Just sped up their meeting. You shouldn't take anyones word for their review. Dont take mine, see it for yourself. I looked at some of these reviews before watching this. Because I know how hit and miss these adaptions can be. I gave it a chance and its engaging if you enjoyed the anime. This anime was short as well, only 27 episodes. The live action should at least be 3 seasons."
erici-94346,Great pass time. What tv is for.,10/10,20 November 2021,"I watched the anime and really I
Enjoyed it so when I found out that Netflix was doing a live action I was happy to hear.My thoughts, first calm down people - it's a tv show to enjoy on pass time and it does that great.First on comparing to the original- I don't care, that just informs me of the general story characters and themes to expect, but any adoption is just that an adoption it's not a copy.Casting is fine some complain about spikes age I didn't realize and I watched the anime show so yeah it was fine.The acting, cgi, action, costumes, etc are spot on and does enough to bring back the good vibes of watching a ""space cowboy"" genre.Final thoughts it's entertaining."
cgmovie85,This Is A Great Show If You View It As An Alternate Reality,9/10,25 November 2021,"It was difficult getting past the first two episodes. I had to stop because it didn't feel authentic or veyr good. But a few days later and midway through the third episode, I decided to watch it as Cowboy Bebop in a different timeline. It's the same three characters with some minor adjustments.The anime was heavy and depressing. I like this live-action being a bit more lighthearted. Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black is the best acting job on the show. Having a daughter feels like a weird and boring plot line, but I get it. Black dad can't get a break even in the future. Lol. John Cho is amazing too, but a lot of his dialogue feels too comical, which I dont' like. Faye cursing all the time feels out of place.The visuals and set designs are amazing. There's too much music; feels like 90%of scenes has music. It's too much, man! Vicious' acting is eh. Spike being called ""Fearless"" is the worst idea I've ever heard being pitched. Fire that person, please.But overall, watching it for what it is, and taking everything into account, I can appreciate this. And maybe after a few more rewatches really see if I love it.Edit: Episode 9 makes it 9 stars."
sgoconnor-15248,Live action success,10/10,20 November 2021,"Wow, finally, wow and finally!I watched this show when I was a kid - 13/14 years old, the cartoon was awesome and this live action wonder has been a pleasure to watch, and has aged beautifully with me (and any others who saw this as a Kid!!), the language and bloodshed has reflected the age of the audience (I assume!! Lol).321 let's jam!

mathd-32500,Season 2 Canceled!,3/10,9 December 2021,"I think it speak by it itself. I feel that series could be as the same action as the anime. I've recently finished the anime series and I cannot compare the quality and the energy. I know that the anime it finish on a cliffhanger and the real life characters is not at all the same. I'm happy the attempt to do with old with the new but should had continued the anime series and finish it.

RachelMarieSmith,Wonderfully Bebop,10/10,19 November 2021,"From the music to the beautiful set design, effects, wardrobe...music...did I say that? Cowboy Bebop is fantastic. I think this is a wonderful original story that anyone who hasn't seen the anime will enjoy. Long time now grown up fans of the anime will enjoy this too.Anime only watchers who are offended by good reviews and are chomping at the excuse to hate on anything that isn't an anime or manga will probably do that to this-even though it doesn't deserve it.Don't be such an insecure weebu. This is a well produced production that is keeping the lights on in someone's home. This series is WELL DONE and they cast/crew/production teams deserve a 2nd season, but I would also love an adaptation of the feature film as well.10/10 Crazy / Uniqie / Well Acted - Very R Rated action, comedy, drama...and JAZZ!"
mateosamaniegovarela,So much better than expected and that is a good thing.,6/10,19 November 2021,"Of course, It is not as good as the original 1998 Cowboy Bebop animated series, which I highly recommend to watch before this one. I also don't think that making this was very necessary at all, but I still think it's a cool gift to the Cowboy Bebop fans that really makes justice to the original series that we all love.I also appreciate the fact that the people involved in this show weren't trying to copy-paste the original material, but tried to create something new and a bit different while offering the same Cowboy Bebop storyline from the original series.

yentsaiwang-50314,Curious..,8/10,10 December 2021,"I am curious to why some people gave this series low score simply because ""the anime is better"" or ""not sticking to the anime story."" Do those guys often compare their exes to their current partners? I saw both and I highly enjoyed this one as well, it's stylish and packaged with dry humor and ridiculousness that really works for me. I enjoyed it for what it is, a fun sci-fi with decent acting and interesting enough story. Sadly we won't see a season 2.

hucklebob,"Smooth, Silly, and a whole lot of Cool.",8/10,19 November 2021,"As a fan of the original i find they captured the vibe of the show very well.John Cho nailed it as Spike.Acting was a bit off from some of the other characters, but it worked for me nonetheless."
akashicorca,The best anime adapted to live action so far,10/10,24 November 2021,"The wistful charm of space bounty hunters lost in their own personal nostalgia traps has been captured in this remake. And now we have details filled in that make the characters more interesting, believable and funny. The anime was great for the 90s but definitely slow by today's standards. We had to wait till the 10th episode to find anything out about Jet's back story. And what did we find out? His long lost marriage actually sucked, but he didn't know it. And that's the end of his story for the whole series.I am so glad the live action version is written with more direction - more detail. Yet it still stays true to the characters' character and the overall philosophy.There is so much to be found in Japan's rich culture of story telling. It is a relief to see a story get adapted to English audiences without getting ""Hollywoodized."" I can't wait for more.

Brundlefly93,Sorry but,2/10,13 September 2023,"John Cho is quite probably the last actor on earth I'd cast as Spike.Spike is tall, lanky and young, he is effortlessly cool but also very obviously kind of a loser. John Cho can't do any of those things right.There's two young actors today that'd be perfect for the role, Lakeith Stanfield and Bill Skarsgard.But if the reason is ""you have to cast an Asian guy as Spike"" then at least choose a Japanese actor, not a Korean one.Jet was good, both the actor and character.The change in Faye and Julia's characters feels like anything that's wrong with adaptations. Apparently there's only one way to write female characters nowadays.Wish Watanabe was as hands on on this as Oda's been on One Piece.And I especially wish only people who loved the source material AS IT IS could adapt it."
viva_la_dube,It's not bebop but feels like bebop,9/10,23 November 2021,"First off I am a HUGE fan of the anime. I know how reboots and adaptions work, so I expected a lot of changes. I honestly expected the worst and was against this show ever being made.It didn't take long for me to realize how different this was going to be but I kept an open mind. The results actually surprised me, this felt like Bebop.I see many complaints about the casting, I honestly felt like the casting was decent. The actor playing Spike felt like spike. The actor playing Jet was phenomenal. It's a little hard to judge the actress playing Faye because the writers added so much dimension to her character but she manages to make the part her own. I didn't really care for Vicious, Julia, and some of the bounties.The music was great sounding and very true to the series.The writing and directing were hit and miss. I feel like some areas (like adding more depth to the trio) were great enhancements. The scene where Spike and Faye bond over bouty scars was great. They also took some depth out of characters(like Pierre Lefrou) that felt like we're done far better in the anime.I like how they made references to radical Ed and the Earth gate explosion (even showing the partially destroyed moon from the gate explosion from the Sympathy for the devil episode of the anime. I don't know of the were all directed by the same person but I thought the third episode was done especially well. I'm not fond of the ending but I remain open to it.All in all I got more I expected. I felt like everyone really made an effort and did their reseach. For as many changes that were made, I'm surprised that I still felt like MY Bebop. I actually enjoyed seeing it and feeling like I'm getting more out of it. Most of the changes made feel fluid, authentic, and fresh. This is the best live action anime I have seen by far. I now find myself looking forward to the next season. Normally I would not give this show a 9/10 but I gave it some extra points for giving me hope on live action animes.If you are a purist and you can't tolerate any form of change, this series is not for you! You will be disappointed! If you loved the original and just want more Bebop in your life, this show may be perfect for you!"
demonetrigan-53722,Underated,9/10,29 June 2023,"I loved the original Cowboy Bebop series... I own the boxset and have watched it many times.I saw how much hate this was getting and thought it was best to avoid it, until curiosity got the best of me. I was prepared to be disappointed.Oh wow was I wrong. Maybe going in expecting it to be bad allowed me to appreciate it for what it is, but I love this series. I am extremely disappointed to know there will never be a season 2.I would watch the hell out of a second season. The acting in this was great. The characters were well done. The visual style was everything I could hope for. It felt like Cowboy Bebop from start to finish.Solid 9/10."
jaimemedina-36288,Oh boy... poo poo,2/10,20 November 2021,"I made it to one third of the way through the first episode. Life is too short to sit through this unfunny dross. The decent production value is completely destroyed by the one track plot monotony. The formula of exposition/fight scene/silly nonsense, wears thin quickly. I cannot imagine sitting through an entire season."
ropelawshiel,No,4/10,21 November 2021,"I enjoy the anime; if you like FireFly or Killjoys (great series), this is a lost opportunity to bring Cowboy to the real world. The script feels it has to use F.... all the time and vast overuse of the Jazz music and toilet humour so sad; the original series deserves better. If you feel FireFly needs rewriting with lots of profanity and toilet humour, then this may be for you. (all this and I am only two episodes in)Just a note I love The Boys. It is full off..ing and c....t etc., but it is so well written, and no one needs to sniff their fingers after a trip to the loo.

krisztian113,I tried. I really tried.,2/10,26 November 2021,"With all my love to the original material i watched the series until the 4th episode, where i simply quit. Before the show i watched some movies with John Cho, and i have to say he is an allright actor. I choose some of he's more ""mature"" movies, but in my opinion he had everything to play Spike.But to be honest, Mustafa Shakir is the best thing this adaptation have to offer. He's acting is top notch. Maybe i have to mention, the Hungarian dub choosen Spike a voice, which sounds like a teenager who always tries to speak like an adult, while Jet's voice is exactly how you imagine this kind of character should speak.Daniella Pineda is someone i really wanted to like and give a chance, but She is acting like a young girl with all those strange faces and everything. I guess they wanted her to do it, but for me, her acting is like when someone forces you to do something, and you ""overdo"" it. Like making every little motion much bigger just to show, how much you disagree... just to strike back.Also the strange camera angles and motions and ideas are... Sometimes i really liked them, at least something unique and new. Sometimes i said ""okey, it's because the series is an adaptation of an anime, so it have to be sometimes silly"", but oh boy... Sometimes it's just pure discomfort. Especially those with Alex Hassell. They wanted to make him well... looks Vicious, and ended up making him look like a clown. Even when he does something othervise evil and gruesome thing, poor guys character is already so ruined for me, that it just does not make the impact. I'm really sorry for the actors and the series, but for me it ended after 3 allright episodes. I do hope others like it, but it's not for my taste."
TheVictoriousV,Thoughts on the series (and the weird fan spite) from a non-fan,5/10,19 December 2021,"It might comfort some readers that I'm not approaching the Cowboy Bebop remake as a fan of the anime (I've gathered ""fans"" aren't held in especially high regard by those who might want to defend this new take). I know very little about the original sci-fi adventure and so I come at the Netflix version with relatively fresh eyes. Nostalgia isn't why I'm here.What did make me interested in Cowboy Bebop, ironically, was the negative word-of-mouth. Not that the show was ""so bad it's good"", but that it supposedly epitomized the contemporary pop culture trend I wrote/warned about in my Harley Quinn review.The trend stems from a desire for better racial diversity in media, as well as giving female characters more to do than simply look sexy (or at least, this is what studios and distribution companies will CLAIM is what motivates them), but the resulting products are perceived as having a spiteful tinge. Cowboy Bebop is cheap-looking, poorly edited (both in terms of plot pacing and action sequences), and just generally irksome to look at, all while supplying irritating characters. I don't know that I agree that it's as spiteful towards a supposed white-male fanbase (nor as hung up on half-baked critical theory and self-satire) as some other reboots, though this manner of counterproductivity appears in the bizarre ""defenses"" of the series, which I'll get to later.Even though I feel like a Nostradamus For Nerds over some of the sh-t I wrote in the Harley Quinn article, let's begin with something I was dead wrong about: The idea that we're all used to this stuff and accept it. My point (which was based on little besides the fact that Harley Quinn had flown under my radar, even though shows like it usually cause fuss) was that geeks have grown weary of fighting for what they love; that they choose to live with the fact that Star Wars, Star Trek, Ghostbusters (between 2016 and now), Disney remakes, comics, or whatever (things that used to function as escapist fun, basically) have become ""contemptuous deconstructions of what they once were"" -- reboots nowadays so often criticize the worlds they profess to adapt through a modern, usually ""more progressive"" lens.I felt that only the turbo-sexists still bothered complaining and everyone else had realized that it's useless to try, since they'd probably get lumped in WITH the turbo-sexists anyhow. I thought the golden age of fighting over cartoons and space-wizard movies was at an end. Boy was I wrong.What I should've realized is that, if there's anything that still riles people up when you make needless modifications to it, it's anime (there's even a famous meme template that compares the faithfulness of manga-to-anime adaptations vs. The laughable/""diverse"" casting choices of most Netflix remakes).When Cowboy Bebop came out, resembling its source material very little in terms of tone or character traits (John Cho as Spike looks fine but even one of the Channel Awesome ""films"" had a more accurate, less grating Ed), there was ample outrage -- I hadn't seen the like since 2017's Death Note. And since we've learned nothing, people involved in the series chose to deride the fanbase (even though the main topic of discussion, namely Faye Valentine's redesign, makes practical sense for a live-action production and can be easily defended with better arguments). To think, by some strange turn of events, this show that failed to please fans (who then got the blame for it) is now canceled.As wrong as I was a few months ago, I did also write: ""...it's bound to get old. My theory is that, if you want to make more money, it may soon be time to do the unthinkable and simply give fanboys more of what they want, instead of the middle finger.""This sort of self-sabotage should tell us something, as should the other ""defenses"" of this series. As someone on Twitter pointed out, there seems to be a whole new genre of journalism where writers explain that, actually, these shows are SUPPOSED to be bad and the fact that they alienate people is totally part of the plan, you guys, we promise (shows like Santa Inc., which alienated the ""fanbase"" of an entire holiday, and The Wheel of Time, which has less-than-stellar ratings, garnered similar coverage).And even now, at the end of it all, journalists try to find copium wherever they can. One of the chief neckbeards on present-day YouTube is Nerdrotic, who gloated at length about this show's cancelation, capping his smug post with ""Don't f-ck with us"" (I'll ignore the eerie Tim Buckley similarities for now).The defenders' takeaway from this (really grasping at straws to strike back at the geeks) was that Nerdrotic meant to imply that he is single-handedly responsible for killing the series, which he clearly isn't so ha-ha, take that Nerdrotic! But the guy's actual, very legible point is that you're asking for disaster when you choose to adapt a beloved work but also hate the people who love it. Some works get away with it, yes, but this stuff DOES happen -- and it HAS. Even if it's true that you're only flicking the middle finger at ""the toxic fans"", there seems to be a consensus that fandom as a whole is toxic. So why do it? This sort of squabble is only good PR until someone loses a Netflix series (I think that's how the saying goes).Cowboy Bebop isn't one of the worst examples of modern-day reimaginings, but in terms of what these ideas can lead to, it's certainly one of the best."
twh-00286,"Entertaining, but...",6/10,24 November 2021,"Being a fan of the original show, I have to say that the live-action version is pretty good too. It is an enjoyable watch and pays tribute, as well as almost taking verbatim from the first episodes.The only question I really have is ""why?""

Cylac,Really enjoyed it!,8/10,27 November 2021,"When I heard this was coming out I decided to binge watch the anime version before as I am an Anime fan. (Loved it)I really enjoyed this live version of it despite the changes they made. I understand why as they needed a way to prolong the series. It's a new twist to a classic.EDIT: Super annoyed that yes ANOTHER amazing series has been cancelled by Netflix. Hopefully another network/streaming service picks this gem up!

AngryBaneling,Another garbage Netflix adaptation.,3/10,22 November 2021,"This terrible low-effort and low-budget western live adaptation of one of the greatest anime of all time shouldn't exist, but it does, so here we go.Most of the main characters have been terribly miscast. Spike doesn't feel like Spike. John Cho is too old and tries too hard to imitate his anime counterpart. Faye is, well, that's NOT Faye. The tone is all over the place, and the show tries too hard to appeal to, well, not anime fans, apparently.The adorable corgi, Ein, is the only redeemable aspect of this show. No, really, that's one cute doggo. Everything else is mediocre, horribly butchered by the likes of modern-day Hollywood for a modern-day audience. Netflix is where good source material goes to die.Watch or rewatch the original anime. You won't find anything in this garbage adaptation that wasn't done better by the anime two decades ago."
QAOSbringer,Tried to imitate but failed really hard,3/10,1 December 2021,"Seriously, how did Netflix make Cowboy Bebop so terrible?I also watched and compared the original anime episodes they imitated. It seems like they made this show with the reason: ""There's this thing called Cowboy Bebop, everybody talks a lot, the dubbed version we made in America is still in business, why don't we buy the IP of it and make money on it?"".One of the biggest features of anime was animation visuals and fluidity in animation. They turned this into like a Syfy series and that visuals and fluidity disappeared. Especially when you compare the Church scene, when he is trying to go upstairs, the weaknesses in this subject is very noticeable. In the anime he is trying to go with a vengeance and greed, in the Netflix series it was like ""do not tire yourself too much, point the gun, we will die anyway"".Anime's other biggest feature was the storytelling and the relations between the characters.Spike isn't bad, but the light hearted vibe is gone and he felt too old and serious for the role.They turned Faye into a very ""Netflix-esque"" character.Vicious is a man-child villain, he doesn't have a tenth of his anime charisma and intimidation.Julia was really butchered, they changed her from a Femme Fatale character to a pop-lipped Tik-Tok influencer.Only Jet Black was successful, and his voice was very similar to the Japanese voiceover from the anime. But they smashed his story at the last minute.While watching the anime, the music really adds a different flavor to the anime, as if the songs are characters themselves. They tried to imitate the same songs, but they couldn't keep the atmosphere and tone of the anime, and it cause the music remain weak in the background.That jazz/blues mood in the anime is gone, and ignoring the subtext of the stories was a major factor.It's like they watched the anime episodes skipping and then shot the Netflix series with what they remembered.They ignored the important details, background designs, ideas behind the stories and made their own imitations over it.Ok, I didn't expect to see the exact same show with exactly the same quality. But I expected them to carry the ""atmosphere"" or ""tone"" of the anime. Instead, they repeated the same mistake made in the Ghost in the Shell movie adaptation. They tried to carbon copy the same story, the same visuals, the same events, while not understanding why and what the original source intended with those story, visuals, events. And this made the adaptation fail really hard."
redcanofevil,Surprisingly Watchable,7/10,24 November 2021,"Definitely a low budget/cheap adaptation of the much beloved anime but one of the best live action anime adaptation for sure. Altho it failed to emulate the tone of the anime due to obvious reasons it did manage to fully capture the spirt of the anime. It deviates here and there but its clear the ones in charge of the project is respectful of the source material and does care about how people might react to this.The two problem I had with the show being low budget and Faye also do get sorted out in a way. Faye altho very different than her anime counterpart is much more tolerable by the end of the show. Again I don't blame the actor for this at all, its the way the character was written and the awful script for her. Daniella Pineda captures the essence of Faye but just wasn't saying the things Faye would've said. Hope it gets better with season 2 because the script really needs the most work, esp for Faye.Spike and Jet were absolutely perfectly cast. I can't believe we made fun when John Cho was cast. Sure he is wayyyy shorter than Spike but he really does play him well, maybe thats why sometimes its more important to play the part than look the part.The show is obviously very tongue-in-cheek and on-the-nose but it works with the low budget. Altho the last scene has serious cause for concern as another anime regular was introduced and boy is he/she going to be a bigger annoyance than Faye was in the first few episodes.A very solid and surprisingly watchable anime adaptation. Its nowhere near the anime but its fun to watch and tries its best to respect the source. Which when it comes to anime adaptation is the best you can get. Its a solid 7/10 series really, one which shouldn't offend the purist and works as an excellent gateway for people to check out the anime.RATING: 7/10."
ashishagupta,Absolutely fantastic show,10/10,30 November 2021,"The cinematography and soundtrack are off the charts. The plot and character development is great for an episodic TV series. All the main characters have interesting story arcs that make them individually fascinating.The actors are endearing. We all know and love John Cho, but the other principal cast members hold their own and were a joy to discover.Many of the other reviews have me incredibly surprised, and not in a good way. I suppose you need atleast a little bit of maturity to enjoy this show.Here is my question to disgruntled Anime fans: if you have seen the greatest near-perfect version before, why squander time watching this show, and then squander even more time writing your ranting review?Movies and TV shows are abridged adapted-for-screen versions of the original text. This is universally understood except for some anime fans. Get a life and grow up, is all that needs be said to these anime fans.If you are over 30 and enjoy jazz, you will absolutely love this show."
mikejohnb1,Stylistic take on a classic anime,10/10,27 November 2021,"For those who are upset about the similarities to the original, view this series as a labor of love and respect for a classic. For those who are upset about the differences, understand that this is like the jazz music that beautifully flows through a number of the episodes... it takes something that is well known and artfully molds it into something that provides a different understanding of the original. The casting and character portrayals are excellent and there is a real chemistry that comes alive on the screen. Similar to the original the music is fantastic and eclectic and really builds on the stories. I appreciate the longer episode format as it allows the viewer to become more invested in the story. Any show that can make you sad one minute and laugh out loud the next has something going for it. Highly recommended for fans of the original and bebop novices alike.

felipelacerda-82823,WHAT A FUN RIDE,10/10,19 November 2021,"Is this series a 10/10? No, it's not. Neither it is the trash some make it up to be. However, I'll give a 10/10 for now so you can give it a chance. Stop listening to the critics and make your mind about this show. IT'S NOT A COPY-PASTE from the anime. It feels different, in a nice way... Give it a chance.

SF cowboys' adventure, a lot of shootings, fights, heists, chases - many of those in and with spaceships and on different planets, a lot of humor, in one word - joyride!Of course, don't expect too much, especially hardcore fans of original anime, this is something very different.Also: Actors are pretty average, production budget pretty cheap, screenplay no brainer...But, great fun! Really nice dose of good old tv entertainment before a bedtime.Just relax and enjoy, it's worth it!

skanklover_69,Better than the anime series,10/10,29 November 2021,"This live action adaptation of the animated series Cowboy Bebop is fun, funny & funky. It's like Guardians of the Galaxy the series. It follows the adventures of a pair of space bounty hunters. I watched a few episodes of the original animated series back in the day, but it never grabbed me, but I'm hooked on this. I think people who love and revere the cartoon are the ones giving this low ratings. From what I remember this is actually visually, sound track and style wise pretty faithful to the anime. It is quite violent with swearing and adult content so I wouldn't recommend it for kids. For everyone else it's one of the most enjoyable binge worthy romps I've watched this year.

Near-L,"Incredible visuals, Anime came to life! But...",1/10,20 November 2021,"The rest feels forced and stupid. But it's actually better than i expected, definitely watchable but not even close to the anime vibes or close to being good on it's own.Edit: i was so wrong on calling this watchable... i sat through it and now im in the Pierret Le Fou episode and omg how cringe that is. Watch the anime instead for god's sake. Absolute garbage!"
lipnusis,A Disastrous Adaptation,1/10,2 June 2023,"Cowboy Bebop (2021), the live-action adaptation of the beloved anime series, is an absolute disaster that fails to capture the essence and charm of its source material. From its poor casting choices to its lackluster storytelling, the series crumbles under the weight of its own misguided attempts at recreating a beloved classic.One of the most glaring issues with Cowboy Bebop (2021) is its mishandling of the characters. The casting choices are questionable at best, with actors who fail to embody the complexity and charisma of the original characters. Their performances lack the depth and chemistry that made the anime so compelling, leaving the audience disconnected and uninvested in their journeys. It feels like a shallow imitation rather than a genuine homage to the source material.The storytelling in Cowboy Bebop (2021) is an utter mess. The pacing is erratic, with episodes that lack cohesion and fail to build a coherent narrative arc. The original series was renowned for its intricate and thought-provoking storytelling, but this adaptation drowns in convoluted plotlines and unnecessary detours. It loses the philosophical depth and emotional resonance that made Cowboy Bebop a timeless masterpiece.The visual aesthetic of Cowboy Bebop (2021) is a disappointment as well. The original series had a distinct and stylish blend of futuristic and noir elements, but the live-action adaptation feels cheap and uninspired. The set designs lack the attention to detail and atmosphere that made the anime so visually striking. It fails to capture the gritty and vibrant world of the original, leaving behind a bland and forgettable interpretation.The action sequences in Cowboy Bebop (2021) are lackluster and poorly choreographed. The original series was known for its slick and thrilling action scenes, seamlessly blending hand-to-hand combat with gunplay. However, the live-action adaptation fails to capture the same level of excitement and intensity, resulting in lackluster and poorly executed action sequences that feel more like a cheap imitation.Ultimately, Cowboy Bebop (2021) is a catastrophic failure that tarnishes the legacy of the original anime. Its misguided casting choices, disjointed storytelling, lackluster visuals, and underwhelming action sequences create a subpar adaptation that fails to capture the spirit and brilliance of the source material. It serves as a painful reminder of how an ill-conceived live-action adaptation can ruin a beloved franchise. Fans of the original series are better off revisiting the anime and avoiding this disappointing and forgettable adaptation altogether."
RyDeRzNewb,another fail,3/10,30 November 2021,"Nothing works right ... Faye was not even close to what i expected & dont get me started on ED or no ED... and probably copy/paste some of the best quotes from the anime without any backup wont make your show good! So cya space-netflix season 2 will be a joke and painful to watch if they decide to massacre this project more.

shahar-zivan,Don't be turned away by the low scores. It's good,8/10,22 November 2021,"Let me start by saying I really dislike Anime as a medium. I simply can't stand the art style and the storytelling style employed in Anime. It just takes me out of the story immediately.That sucks, because I have many Anime-fan friends and I keep hearing about these great stories that I don't get to enjoy. Cowboy Bebop is one of the ones I hated being left out of, because my Anime-loving friends kept raving about it.So, when this came out, I was excited. Especially after a few early reviews said it gets a lot of it right, I was expecting a masterpiece....And this wasn't it. I was honestly really disappointed after the first episode. The writing is corny and cliche-ridden, the dialogue is eyeroll-inducingly unnatural, and it's predictable as hell. But I decided to give it a chance to get better and win me over, and it did.The writing doesn't get any better, the dialogue stays goofy and the stories are extremely predictable, but... it's just so stylish. It's beautifully shot, wonderfully directed and the soundtrack is just incredible. The action scenes are awesome, the comedic timing is great, the world is intriguing and the campy writing just kinda fits into it.The actors do a surprisingly good job delivering the goofy lines they're reading, and the main cast has a good enough chemistry to make you like them.In the end, I really enjoyed it. It's not a masterpiece, and you shouldn't expect one. It's just fun, pretty, dopamine-enducing nonsense to turn your brain off to and enjoy. I'd say it pretty much fills the exact same spot that Cobra Kai did.As for all the negative reviews taking down the score, if you go over them quickly you'll see 90% of them complain about nonsense like the actors not looking like the anime characters.If you haven't seen the anime, or are mature enough to accept that living people aren't gonna look like drawings, I'd say there's a good chance you'll like it."
wow-70703,It ain't the anime but....,10/10,20 November 2021,"So this live action adaptation won't ever stack up to the anime but as a faithful reinterpretation it does a really great job. The actors put a ton of heart into their characters, the sets are Superbly re-created, and the musical score is just how the anime fan remember it! So don't judge it based on Cowboy Bebop but understand that it's simply Cowboy Bebop 2.0 produced for old and new fans alike.

fajarsantoso,Same mistake made,3/10,21 November 2021,"Cowboy Bebob is yet another failure of a Hollywood production based on a successful Asian production. The Ring, Shutter...is there a bell ringing, people of Netflix? Or perhaps Ghost in the Shell? Still no bell ringing?That's why, if you were a fan of Cowboy Bebob, stay away of this production and use your time more efficiently. There are probably a zillion other things you can do then watching this failure.

subwmn,Better than anime to movie,9/10,4 December 2021,"As much as I love anime and Ruroni Kenshin and Full Metal Alchemist, they were bad as movies. I stopped watching them after a few minutes, but Cowboy Bebop live action series was great. Not knowing anything about the anime, but getting the gist of it, I like it. It had humor and the actors spoke English. No subtitles like in the other anime to movies. I had my doubts, but better for me and glad I watched.

rabijaved-77123,Loved it. Ignore the salty haters.,10/10,27 November 2021,"Entertaining show with great casting and interesting story. Had me hooked. Don't listen to the salty haters and give it a go. Ppl giving a bad score just because the cast doesn't resemble the cartoon characters in the anime is just hillarious.

TheRopeIsComing,Awful. Awful. Awful.,1/10,7 December 2021,"Every character change is for the worse, the story and writing is terrible, the acting barely passable and the casting is so far off you wouldn't believe it.Spike is 50 years old Harold or Kumar from Harold and Kumar LOL, spike is literally a 50 year old asian man hahahahahahThe only white man is the big bad, don't care but it's just funny considering he's the only talented actor in the entire show.

grinningelvis,All your worst fears confirmed...,1/10,19 November 2021,"As bad as I thought it could be, it actually ended up being worse. Wrong in every way, from casting to script tone to color pallet. This is just bad tv. Dull, lifeless noise with barely a hint of self awareness. That it's a remake of one of the most stylish and sophisticated shows of all time is unforgivable.Who the hell was this intended for? And how can two-dimensional drawings have so much more heart and nuance than a team of 100 or so actors?Just embarrassing.

ashwin-avasarala,"Lead actors got it, the writers screwed it up",6/10,28 May 2022,"John Cho and Mustafa Shakir understood their characters really well and played them to perfection, even though the writers don't seem to understand character study. The script is plot and visual feel focused instead of being character driven. As a result the show lost what it was about - sociological commentary on the self destructive nature of people and destructive nature of greed / capitalism. This is pretty much why GoT last season sucked compare to the books / previous seasons.In addition, the original show let you fill in the blanks and treated the viewers with intelligence. The live action just spells everything out, and I don't need to see everything just because it looks visually good. Pineda understood her character well, but she is not as good an actor, yet, as the other leads, who delivered despite the script challenges.

preiso,Very Fun,8/10,21 November 2021,"I've seen the English-dubbed version twice, and loved it both times. I've also worked in the film industry (local) for over 15 years, and I understand the difficulty in finding actors that both look & sound the part, and mesh well together. It's not so hard to find voice actors to do that alone.While there are some misses that get fired here, overall, it's fairly more faithful to the source material than just about any other Anime translation from Japanese to US (anyone want to argue that? *clears throat* Dragonball Z? Anyone?)It would be nigh impossible to find someone who both looks and acts each part, so they did the best w/ what they have, and these actors are doing everything in their power to keep it faithful. If they get to season 2, I'm REALLY excited to see if they can make Ed work. Ed was my favorite character in the Anime. Perhaps I identify more w/ Ed...?Either way, this is a really great jumping-on point for anyone who's not seen the Anime. After you watch this, watch the original and see for yourself how great the Anime is... 😁"
jamesbradbury5,Worse than you could possibly imagine,1/10,27 November 2021,"The world is a worse place because this adaptation exists. Loving the source material doesn't make you qualified to adapt it. Cowboy Bebop already has a great English dub, it's super accessible, this garbage does not justify it's existence.It's infuriating to think there's going to be a large group of people where this is going to the their only exposure to the world of Cowboy Bebop, or maybe it's just depressing, either way, negative emotions.Seriously watch the original series, give this a pass.

DearAsians,Nice drama but where is action director and effect editor?,9/10,20 November 2021,"Great, cowboy bebop was my last anime as fan when My youth age, this director good catch humor code from anime but he didn't respect Chinese kungfu actor like a bruce lee so every action in this drama looks like dance (look at their eyes where they see) that is worst and if I suggest someone mind next season, change all comic mood as serious like a 'boardwalk empire' not cowboy bebop as cowboy bebop's codes are Bluce lee and Jazz and gangsters not just a humors.

mdilore,Watch the cartoon first and you'll understand,8/10,22 November 2021,"I've been a fan of Cowboy Bebop for many years now and was very excited to hear about a live action reboot. The cartoon is fantastic and I can only speculate that Joss Whedon got ideas from the cartoon when he was creating the Firefly series. So far I think this show is a very good rendition of the cartoon. The only reason that I can surmise that this show is not getting the best reviews so far is that a lot of the people that are watching this are not familiar with the cartoon.To conclude my review I think the show is very good thus far and I would highly recommend watching the animated series first. This will help you understand the characters, format, sequencing, and overall story much better!

andrejurado-1,Style over substance,5/10,23 November 2021,"Mimicking the original cartoon just ain't gonna cut it. That made the actors sound cartoonish and unrealistic. That's a downer for me right there. Plus, even the original's score sound a bit boring and drags the directing down with it. Sorry but it's a no no. I gave it a 5 for the production value. It looks really good! Still, I couldn't even finish the first episode.

lamkim-87547,The live action adaptation we've all been waiting for - 4 episodes in and it's actually doing something,9/10,19 November 2021,"So i've watched the anime version (which's the original source for this tv-series). And belive me, the show's super boring and mediocre at best when you're just a few episodes in, without a patient mind, you'd probably never get to the fun part, or climax.In that case, the live action version had all of the problem as mentioned above fixed. First episode in and you can see the depth of those wanted criminals, not just some bland lovers and died out of savagery. As their death, depicted in this version was also the same, yet you can still feel at least some bit of humanity left inside them."
briantrueblood-89516,Stop comparing every little thing!,10/10,24 November 2021,"I've been a fan of the show since I bought a bootleg copy in Iraq. Let me start off saying. You're never going to capture the original. Not possible. The charterers will be slightly different, the stories will be slightly different, everything since it's not a Japanese anime, will be slightly different. You can't do the same thing in real life it's impossible.It's a good live action telling. Probably one of the greatest anime adaption even though that's not saying much. Everybody needs to get over themselves and enjoy it for what it is.

CANpatbuck3664,"Takes a Little Patience but When Bebop Hits its Stride, You'll Want to Cowboy Up For The Ride",8/10,17 January 2022,"Cowboy was ahead of its time for anime, telling its tale of space cowboys collecting bounties and stirring up trouble along the way. I watched an episode of the original anime for context and having seen the entirety of season 1 of this version, there are changes but with the look and vibe of the original show are ever present. Cowboy replicates several parts of the show pretty well in the live action format and it carries the tone across effectively. The overall wavelength is very reminiscent of Firefly (I know the original anime predates Firefly) but with less earnestness and more of a focus on being ""cool"". The visual effects work is decent, the writing is pretty tight and there's plenty of unique characters. I would also point out that the action scenes were pretty average but most of the new version works and I even liked the updated cut of the opening theme with the new credits.Getting to the characters and the plot, even if it's expanding on what was already created, the strength of this show is how wonderfully weird it gets. The overall arc of the plot is familiar (save for a decent twist at the end that played with expectations) but from episode to episode, there's a surprising amount of variety. It was pretty entertaining watching the Bebop's crew pursue their targets, from a French hit man that's afraid of cats to kidnapper that targets rich dogs to an AI trying to entrap you in limbo etc. They do a good job of making the crew appear competent yet they're always tripping over themselves and each other (in a very Guardians of the Galaxy way). It was never boring and led to a fair amount of laughs. It made me excited to watch the next episode and more often than not, if you can give me a chance to laugh as you're letting the story unfold, I'll be willing to ride along.For all the criticism surrounding the casting, I think that they nailed it. John Cho has always been underrated, he's funny but he's a skilled dramatic actor as well (he's great in the Abrams Star Trek movies but check out Searching for a really great performance by him). Playing Spike so aloof didn't seem to suit him at first but his performance grew on me as the show went on. Ditto for Mustafa Shakir, in the first episode he seemed like a musician that could only play one note (intimidating but secretly soft) but he really grows with the character. He fits the part of Jet Black but I really liked his chemistry with Cho and Pineda. Speaking of Pineda, I've always had a soft spot for her after some of her early work. I was surprised how far she leaned into Faye being the wild card in the crew, she isn't trying to be likeable but she compensates with a really dry sense of humour. She became indispensable as the show went on and despite there being some changes from the original character, she did a good job making it her own. Elena Satine, Tamara Tunie and Alex Hassell round out the rest of the main cast. Each of them are pretty good, Hassell is really over-the-top but he's given some context as the show progresses. Satine does a good job playing the sultry damsel and Tunie is warm and inviting as everyone's favourite club owner Ana.My biggest problem with Cowboy Bebop is that it takes a while to get going. After 3 episodes, the series was just middling for me and I was wondering what all the fuss (from both sides of the fanbase) was about. But then the full crew materialized and came together in episode 4 and it was a real shot in the arm. Bebop really gained some momentum at that point and I never looked back for the remainder of the journey. This isn't an uncommon problem, as much as I loved Game of Thrones, the early episodes were pretty dry and you had to stick with it. I thought Bebop was well worth it in the end. In a more minor quibble, the second to last episode is oddly placed in the series. Bebop is deliberately coy with Spike's backstory and while they're trying to cultivate mystery surrounding his character, they spell it out for you in Blue Crow Waltz. The episode itself is well done and it capably answers many of the lingering questions heading into the finale. But if they had placed earlier in the show's sequence, it would have helped us care more about Fearless' and Julia's rekindling or encouraged us to invest more in the feud between Fearless and Vicious. I just thought it felt like a misuse of resources, if they had made it the 2nd or 3rd adventure with the Bebop crew, I would have been hooked earlier and had a deeper connection to our heroes.The experience of watching the live action version of Cowboy Bebop has divided the viewers into 2 camps. If you've seen the original, this version is derivative garbage that insults the beloved anime. But most of the uninitiated (at least on IMDb) seem to have enjoyed it to varying degrees. I fall in the latter camp. It's not engrossing or enveloping material but I had a lot of fun with this show and I'm disappointed it wasn't renewed. Even if it doesn't break the mould or blaze a new trail like the original, it was entertaining at worse and a trip at its best. I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you're new to the property. Just give it some time, the Bebop will get you to your destination Space Cowboy."
noirink-12054,It's not THAT bad...,6/10,20 November 2021,"Most of the actors doing their job well and are sympathic. Except the guy who plays vicious is truly a misscast. At certain moments the show felt really rushed and cheap made. Also the actionscenes seemed somewhat off. Some changes to the story left me also my head scratching. I was entertained nonetheless.

josetinta,"Ok, we can be fine",8/10,19 November 2021,"At the end of the 90s one of the best animes we have seen, Cowboy Bebop, a mixture of personalities, film genres and diverse music, in addition to a fantastic travel, was released.Now 20 years later a live action is released, which is not a disappointment like what Death Note was, although it is not the revelation of the year either. It is a series that works well from the technical aspect, the performances, the setting and the music (obviously by Yoko), with a plot that could have been treated better, but it works. Besides that some changes that are given are good and enjoyable. There are also no signs of misunderstanding of the characters (again, obviously because of Watanabe) and there is good chemistry between all the characters.The best thing is to watch this series with an open mind and having the expectations of finding something good and enjoyable without fear of being disappointed, do not be prejudiced by the American, live action, etc. Because although it does not have the absolute depth of the original series, it has its own rhythm and develops the journey of the characters correctly.In conclusion, allow yourselves to enjoy the series, because it has elements that make it really good (yes, if it were an individual series it would be the best it would have given us this last days, but good as an adaptation ...) and it achieves not disappoint the fans, much less the viewers in general."
pilgrimtom,"Again, Cowboy Bebop goes to prove . . .",10/10,22 November 2021,". . . that some folks just don't get it.No, I never watched the original series nor did I read the Manga.This show is the best thing that I have seen in years; Irreverent, engrossing, funny as Hell when it should be and a glorious, non-stop action event when it should be.The music is awesome and the combination fills it with charm and style. Wonderful!Reviews either are disappointed fans or they don't get what they are doing here. Try it, be open minded. Wonderful!

nordmeyerx-87385,Despite the reviews not that bad.,8/10,24 November 2021,"I have watched the original anime show and I understand why hardcore fans of the series are upset. However as far as entertainment this show is pretty good and has all the elements I am looking for in a sci fi show. Action, Acting, somewhat decent story writing, good effects and choreography. I have no issues with the casting, especially of spike, as I always though the original spike was too young to be a seasoned Syndicate operative.So, not bad. Not earth shaking, but certainly has my attention.

owen-watts,"See You, Space Cowboy...",6/10,27 October 2022,"I always struggle to see the function of live action anime remakes because fans of the anime surely just want... more of that and people who don't know the anime would surely rather watch the original? I'm in the latter camp and as bombastically presented and as well cast as this is (Mustafa Shakir can do no wrong) I have no frame of reference and it made me feel like I was missing out on something. The core trio are good fun but the noirish romance/revenge plot that runs under the sci fi capers is turgid and uneven. The CG was surprisingly strong at points but you could feel the ghost of animation tugging at it throughout. An indulgent experiment... is all this could ever have been.

yowilwasup,Snappy dialog bot glitched,1/10,22 November 2021,"Obviously the random movie character generator is acting up again. This couldn't have happened at a worst time because at the same time the ""snappy dialog bot"" is stuck on ""quip"". The bad luck doesn't end there. The genre ""mash-up algorithm is stuck on kitsch. I watched two episodes and as I'm sad and lonely I will watch another episode. As I am of average intelligence after I'm finished watching I expect to be a little dumber."
jsucie,Interesting and fun,8/10,9 December 2021,"So I will be reviewing as someone who has zero connection or knowledge of the source material this show is produced from.This to me was a fun show overall but not without its problems too. I'll say my 2 biggest gripes about this are that John Cho is such an odd character to play fearless in the sense I've never seen him do this kind of action before. Perhaps he is true to the character and does a good job of portraying him. Now this isn't me bashing him as I enjoy most of what the actor has done and he does a fine performance here as well. Secondly the actual hand to hand combat seemed off and far too choreographed; with that it seemed slow like everyone was thinking about the motions rather than them coming more naturally.What I did enjoy was the noire settings giving that Blade Runner with a hint of the show/game Defiance to it. The idea of bounty hunters in the future which does have material out there for that genre but not as much as you'd think there might be on the small screen given how rich of a topic it could be.All the main actors did a fine believable job in their roles with shoutouts going to Daniella Pineda as Faye and Alex Hassell as Vicious. It was also nice to see some familiar small screen sci-fi faces sprinkled throughout.I'm sure this will, and by judging of some of the purist responses, not be for everyone or they may downright not like it at all for whatever reason including that it isn't like it's source material. From someone who knows nothing about said material, this was enjoyable but I fully understand if it isn't picked up for a second season."
StrandedPirate,"Yes, uh huh, yup, be-bop a do, yeeha!",10/10,24 November 2021,"It's not everyday that I'm hooked on a series from the first episode, but this was one of the rare ones. A lot of parallels between this show and Firefly as well as Sin City. The editing, music choices, cinematography, and actors are all top notch; I dig what their puttin down. The whole crew should be proud of this; I'm thoroughly entertained and needing more.

Edis7771,"It's a good show, weebsters can never be pleased",8/10,20 November 2021,"My honest suggestion, ignore all the reviews that compares this show to anime. Weebs were ranting before the show was even out.First episode wasn't the greatest, but it keeps getting better and more interesting with every next one.Story isn't the deepest, but it's there. If you want a show with a bunch of action, jokes, space, good looking visuals and a corgi it's the right thing to watchThe show reminded me of Mandalorian - every episode main characters are on a different quest while main plot/characters slowly develops as well.Watch it, it's pretty good.

Aria_Athena,"Oh no, what they did to my boy.",3/10,20 November 2021,"I only watched 1 episode, so I'll refrain from giving it the ace that it truly deserves. I couldn't do that to myself, I had to stop. The opening scene is all you need to see to get a feel about the show. The casting is probably the most glaring offence. If you've seen the original show, you will have to give it try for curiosity's sake. If you haven't, just watch the original. It hurts me physically how much this pales in comparison.

cameragod,Not as relient on tropes as the original,8/10,24 November 2021,"One of the things about the original was it reliance on the characters doing something because that's what their character trope would do and not because of something the story had set up as their motivation. In the anime characters took actions, shared moments and emotional payoffs they hadn't earned through anything they had done or said. The show relied heavily on the viewer providing their own context to the trope filled shorthand to link the sometimes random character actions.The NETFLIX show attempts to ""fix"" this. It tweeks the characters to give them reasons to behave as they do other than that's just what that type of character would do. Spike and Fay's ""shower/bath/shower"" dialog does more to bond them and explain their relationship to each other than anything that happened in the anime show.I liked it but obviously some don't like script driven characters and were not bothered by all the ""wtf"" plot shifts in the anime show... after-all it was just cartoons :)The only thing that dragged a bit for me was every scene with Vicious and Julia... although I feel that ep. 9 and 10 made that worthwhile."
calamtaylor,Pleasantly supprised!,8/10,19 November 2021,"I was initially hesitant when I first heard they were attempting to do a Cowboy bebop live adaptation, but boy was I wrong! They've managed to encapsulate the fun that is Cowboy bebop and even better Yoko's new score's blasting away in the background! Yes there is a lot that misses the mark of what was in the original show, yes it's also not fully canon to the anime, some of the original story has a slight twist to it but for the most part, it works. Please if you're a die hard fan of the anime go into this knowing it's a different show and isn't an exact remake. Watch out for the cool little easter eggs though! Please bear in mind if you're hesitant or someone who hasn't watched the anime please ignore the reviews and watch the show! This will be review bombed by anime purists, people who haven't even watched a second of the show!"
protilius-862-771061,Brilliant,10/10,22 November 2021,"Don't care about the fanboy hate, as a guy that played the original on repeat to fall asleep at night, before it was found mind you... I find all of this a tastefully crafted balance of old and new.Casting is great, wonderful chemistry with the various relationships and banter, soundtrack was masterful.They retold all of the old stories in new ways and it was fun, light hearted (in a violence addict kinda way), and super classy... Which may be something some reviewers lack these days. Always looking for a reason to rip a thing down... I found no good reasons here.Super pleased... hope they get a second season going immediately. I'll take it.Darn great time and super nostalgic. They did awesome ""Americanising"" this. Gotta admit though... It was always a better experience with Japanese voiceovers, but in this rare instance I can forgive it because they really captured the mojo here.I dig it...Now don't be a Choom and give it a chance. 4th episode is a real treat... stick it out, have some Skooma."
VorianG,Cancellation? Seriously?,9/10,12 December 2021,"Netflix has an ocean of garbage series and they cancelled this show because of bad reviews from anime fans who did not like even the original anime. This is was an excellent adaptation for a space opera - noir anime.

garcapolis,Anime super fans are haters,10/10,24 November 2021,"I absolutely loved the anime as well. They did a frigging amazing job with this adaption. If I'm honest I'd give it 8.5 or 9 but I'm balancing the scales a bit. I honestly feel they did an amazing job. Come on people. Think about the air bender adaption. Anime adaptions generally suck and they did a really good job with this one. Diverse cast, great fight scenes, great music, great cgi, solid writing and fairly faithful to the source. Stop hating.

tom_maxey,People love to hate,8/10,5 December 2021,"Cowboy Bebop is one of the coolest anime's ever made, the live action remake doesn't disappoint, while also not ripping off its predecessor. Both versions exist while not taking anything but story inspiration for each other. The live action version add depth to the story of the original while also creating its own aesthetic. The casting is perfect, the effects are amazing, and the writing is finally clever instead of a clunky English translation.

avidiva,Liked the visuals but writing and dialogue is shallow,1/10,26 November 2021,"I don't mind the creative liberties the showrunners took regarding the story. That is to be expected and it gives them the chance to do more than But I have issues regarding the dialogue. The lead characters barely hold any credible conversation. They spend so much time throwing around juvenile lines and trying to be funny it is impossible to take them seriously. The original anime allowed us to invest in many characters, even ones that lasted only one episode. It had light and funny, emotional, serious, suspense, melodramatic, and every kind of moment. The entire live show looks like a caricature of the original anime bery shallow and too focused on being funny. I don't get how characters in the anime and 2D images had more emotion and depth than this live adaptation with its excellent cast of actors. I don't blame the actors, its not their fault. But Netflix, the directors, and writers should really reevaluate how they are approaching this project. If they intend to carry out the next season like season 1, its better to end the show with one season.

sheast,Very Good!! Give a chance.,8/10,23 November 2021,"I thought this series was very good. Right amount of drama, comedy, slap-stick, mystery, & cliffhangers. And in 30 minute episodes. Amospheric...old v. Futuristic! Can't wait for a season 2. Lots more to unpack with the crew of Spike, Jet, Faye, Vicious, & Julia.

star_hazard,Clunky but funky,5/10,28 November 2021,"I've watched my fair share of cringe live action so I find it understandable how it's hard to separate the two. Let's not even talk about DBZ and ATLA. Yikes. But for this one I never watched the anime so I'm a blank slate here. I have nothing to compare it.Alright then so, I quite like the cast especially their banter with one another. I think my favorite is Jet but Spike is close second. As for their acting...kind of weird in some parts if you've watched Shang-chi they have similar acting.. stoic faces with occasional emotions with a lot of close-up and eye twitching. The whole set is a bunch of mixed themes...cowboys, space ships, western bars, Japanese culture etc.. it's honestly so all over the place but I guess it kind of fits with space post earth era? But with the lack of world building background sometimes it's a bit hard to get into it. The costumes...some look okay but some look well like costumes like Faye's hair and Spike's main outfit for some reason it just looks off, kinda tacky. The action sequences are hit and miss too. Some parts are awkward and looked too choreographed to be smooth. My favorite is the music scoring. Love the jazz and everything else especially during fight scenes.Overall for me, I find it clunky but funky. Good enough watch. Yeah some of the scenes and acting were kind of stiff, off and rustic but I'm not really mad at it since I never expected Oscar worthy acting. Feels like those niche indie shows. It has that type of vibe weirdly enough. I feel like it's a mix of The 6th Day, Bungouku Stray dogs and Space Sweepers.It's episodic in nature so the plot is scattered in between ""bounty of the day"". I quite like mystery and crime syndicate themes so it scratches that itch for me. I'd say if you're into the weird and funky mystery action you might like this. Just don't expect dramatic and emotional vibes (I mean there's some drama with their back story but I didn't get invested enough to feel anything) as this has more of a light watch than something somber and deep for me.Does make me want to watch the og so I get more story... Actually I might just watch the anime later and see the what's what lol."
qstanzak,Joyful and exciting ride so far! 5 episodes in,10/10,19 November 2021,"I'm 5 episodes into Bebop, and I can say I had my doubts but after watching the introduction to Spike & Jet in the first episode I felt very relieved. While initially I thought it would be almost a direct scene for scene adaptation of it's anime counterpart, I quickly realized Netflix decided to add more elements to each of it's characters to seemingly fill up the extra half hour all episodes were given in comparison to the anime.Some of the stories are more intriguing than others, but the differences greatly range and show the dynamic of each character. They all differ immensely and I'm certain it will even become more apparent as I get through the latter half of the first season.The casting was brilliant, I've seen people saying John Cho wouldn't be a good fit for Spike Spiegel but he really captures the same charm as his anime counterpart, as does Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black and Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine. The trio works great even if their screen time all together is rather limited.My biggest problem really stems from Episode 1, albeit a minor issue but in the shows entirety the set designs have been top notch. Beautiful CGI, amazing choreography just for some reason some of the set pieces in Episode 1 looked... rather dull. Almost gave me concern they were going to be tight on a budget, but after seeing the next few episodes I was no longer concerned.Sure some moments are almost predictable, for example in Episode 5 you really get a good focus on Jet's backstory and there's a few twists I saw coming a mile away but it really didn't bother me. I love these characters and even though I may be able to see what's about to come (whether it's from seeing the anime before or just having a hunch) I still love this shows unique atmosphere and could entirely see myself watching it a few times over again.I think this is a huge win for Netflix, and for Cowboy Bebop fans that aren't so quick to destroy an adaptation of an already great show. Even if it doesn't live up to the anime (which in my mind it does!) we should be happy we have new content to delve into after all this time!Thank you for reading!"
sharan2395,Don't listen to most fans of the anime,8/10,22 November 2021,"Of course, regardless of this review, to each their own but I feel that the negative reviews from most anime fans are kind of unfair because this isn't supposed to be like the anime. Its not a live action remake, it's an R-rated adaptation and so many forget what that means. It's taking the premise and the universe and doing its own thing in a different format. I was originally kind of wary about the show as I am also a fan of the anime but having watched it, I really liked what they did with it and am glad they didn't try to stick to the OG too much because we already have the anime and redoing it frame for frame would've been boring and pointless because we already have the original anime............I also really like the changes/additions they have done to the story. Once again, I don't want a frame for frame remake so it was really refreshing to see how they mixed it up. They still kept the premise of the original episodes but executed differently - you know, what an ""adaptation"" is. It was coherent and easy to follow, didn't try to overcomplicate things and was well done from start to finish.I also think the casting was done nicely. As a fan of the original, I instantly connected to each character and found them to be very human for the first time. Of course, the characters are kind of different from their animated counterparts but again, it's an R-rated adaptation so it's kind of unfair to rate it badly for the characters taking liberties somewhat. Btw, I never found the characters to be too different, this is pretty much what I expected them to be like as real people with the sliiiiight exception of Vicious (but I like Alex Hassell's work with the character so I'm over it).I think most people who haven't watched the anime and won't watch the anime (which is probably most people on Netflix) will like this show because it has great production value and is really enjoyable - especially when not trying your hardest to scrutinise it against the original anime. And its kind of funky which is exactly what the original was as well."
tfstbrice,"A lot of fun, with a high production value",8/10,23 November 2021,"A very well done show. As a fan of the anime I'm glad it stuck to it at times scene for scene and brought over to live action with a great cast, nice cinematography and more..Had they deviated from the original I'm sure it would be criticised heavily. I've loved the series and it deserves praise 🙂 it's shot beautifully and cast all do a great job.. highly recommend.

olegmaluhin,Crappy adaptation but it looks like they tried,4/10,19 November 2021,"Production values and action are not bad and Spike actor is doing an ok job. Opening is a cool homage to the source material. Same goes to music score. Directly from the original. It's great that more people would get a chance to apreciate amazing music made by ""Seatbelts"" and Yoko Kanno. Thats pretty much all pros from my point of view. On the other hand, writing is subpar at best, most of the lead characters are cartboard copies of themselves but support cast is even worse. Same goes to acting. Story is shallow and contrived. Feels like kids show with some pretentious subplot drama. Fights are goofy and cartoonish with some blood splatter on top. General tone is very gullible and stakes in the story never feel high. Overall, you'll have a better time with the original animation but if you're a big a fan already, this adaptation would probably make you sad. With lowered expectations it's a passable watch though.

darcynader,A Real Mixed Bag...,7/10,19 November 2021,"... But with enough good stuff to make it worth watching. It's stylish, has great (if sometimes oddly placed) music. The set design and period are stunning, pudding with cool and dropping with grove. I love all the little touches and details that bring a lived in feel to the world.Taken as a cheesy, campy, retro-styled action romp, it's a pretty darn fun ride. It feels like it's meant to be a camp 70s noir serial, but with modern filming technique.Tbh, the anime doesn't hold up as well as folks like to remember. But it's still good. This isn't quite as stylish as it could be, but it's still good. Where the anime felt like its episodes were built around it's score, this feels like the score was considered after the action was filmed.

rich-mac,So close ...,6/10,27 December 2021,"Cowboy Bebop will probably gain a cult following - the soundtrack and cinematography alone could carry that.It's one of those first series runs that gets progressively better as the series unfolds, but that begs the question as to why it didn't get more script development, rehearsal time, and general refinement early on.All the elements were there to do something really good, and it has some very stylish and engaging moments, but the delivery has been lumpy and inconsistent, marred by moments of overacting and descent into farce - things that could have been ironed out with keener direction and a firmer hand.But even though it carries the burden of its own clumsiness it still manages to entertain and divert. It came soooo close to being really good, but didn't quite make it.A solid 5.5 which I marked up to 6, which is probably a little gratuitous."
kwes26,"Fun show, high quality but...",10/10,27 November 2021,"First of all the production quality on the show is top notch. The camera work, set design, cgi etc are all very well done. I'd say the acting, story and humor is on par with the show 'Lucifer'. The only thing is in the first few episodes, the soundtrack is really distracting with all the horns and jazz beats. But it seems to get better after the first four or five episodes. At the time of writing this, this show had scored a 6.7. I'd say it deserves more around an 8. Give it a chance. If you hate the jazz soundtrack just know it gets better later on. The show is worth it.

roaches_97,Compare this to the original.,1/10,17 November 2022,"This show is a disaster. A lot of the reviews here say it's fine if you don't compare it to the original show, but it's an adaptation, meaning the most direct point of comparison for this show is the original anime. I still think that this show would be bad without comparisons to the original but as an adaptation it's just pathetic. The action is bad, it lacks style, it isn't funny, most of the acting is bad, and none of the characters feel like they do in the original series. That's the problem with American remakes like there. Aside from Alita, not a single American anime remake has worked. The biggest problem this show has is being compared to the original. This show is mediocre at best and terrible at worst, but it's being directly compared to one of the best shows of all time. I'm not trying to say that this show is being unfairly criticized, I'm saying that even if this show was solid it would be compared to a show that many people consider the best anime ever. If they didn't want to get criticized this hard then they shouldn't have touched this IP.

donnakdunbar,I love this show,10/10,11 December 2021,"I'm really disappointed that Netflix chose to cancel it before really giving it a chance. I think too many people who were fans of the original cartoon had unrealistic expectations and wanted the live action rendering to be identical. This show was funny, well written, had plenty of action, and was only just beginning to touch on the driving factors behind Spike's lonliness--something the haters seemed to want--when the plug was pulled. So much yet to be explored, but now will never come to light.

I'm a fan of the anime and honestly this was well made, it was surprisingly enjoyable, good not great but then what live action anime is? The cast are really good, stayed true to some parts from the anime, action scenes are decent was expecting better. Hope to see you again space cowboy."

lawrencelawrence86,It's fine but why?,4/10,22 November 2021,"Why try to live action a master piece of animation. It can never be as good, make something new and don't give it the bebop name. Such a waste of money and time.

Okfreedom,The Worst Netflix Original of all time.,1/10,19 November 2021,"I never thought it would be possible. We all heard the stories, we watched the announcement trailer, praying that they didn't mess it up.And yet, they did. I mean, I knew it was going to be bad.....but, wow! I didn't expect them to mess up this bad. Everything feels wrong, to the point where I actually think this is the worst Netflix adaptation ever.The directing feel lazy and stiff at the same time. The fight scenes are just badly done while the fight scenes in the much older anime series felt more realistic. The dramatic scene don't really work either as tonally and editing-wise, it just clashes even more with the campy feel of the show.The writing feels way too quippy when the anime had it's fair share of quiet moments. While the anime is Tarantino, the Live-Action is Shane Black gone horribly wrong. Too much comedy, not enough drama. And even the drama feels forced and cheap. The characters also have completely different personalities compared to the original which makes it much worse in my opinion.The casting feels completely off. John Cho is too old for Spike and even then, he doesn't bring anywhere close to the level of charisma that the original Spike had. Daniella Pineda was also horribly miscast as she not only brings the wrong type of charisma to the table but also brings way too much snark to the point where she actually felt annoying everytime she was on screen. The only casting they got right was Mustafa Shakir who actually acted like Jet and felt like he was trying with his performance.The cinematography feels as lifeless and stiff as the the sets they've built for the show. There's not much camera movement, the frame rate feels off and most of the shots consist of dutch angles (if you thought the dutch angles in Thor were bad, then wait till you see this). This is from the same cinematographer of The Witcher so that kind of explains the awkward angles a bit.Production Design is really bad for a Netflix series or for a series in 2021. Rather than something beautiful, this looks like a bad cosplay/fan-film with a shoe-string budget.They brought back Julie from the dead. And made her into one of the antagonists. No, I'm serious. I swear, I'm not making this up. While she was in flashbacks and was killed off in the original, here they disrespect her character in the worst way possible and thus, miss the point of why she died and what it meant for Spike. Long story short, she turns against Spike, shoots him out of the window (yes, the window scene from the anime makes it way here in the worst way possible), and we get the window scene complete with even the same music.Ed also come into the series...........right at the very end. So Spike stumbles into an alley and falls unconscious. Here, we are treated to a painfully uncomfortable POV shot of an excited Ed as he tries to wake him up. The acting in the scene feels over the top and sadly, Ed is completely out of place. I'm sorry to say but they should have left her out of this one.Only positive is that they brought back Yoko Kanno and her soundtrack still rules. That's about it.I've got nothing. This is even worse than Death Note."
knightox,It's Good but the current times effect the classic story.,7/10,14 December 2021,"I like it. However our PC times threaten to destroy the source material. Hope it doesn't. I want this classic to go out in style. Spike and Jet are done well. Faye is a total disappointment. She was meant to be a hottie. A good looking brunette who compares to an American super model (but had a few issues with Spike, Jett and sometimes Ein, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi). Should have had a taller girl with legs.Not too happy that Netflucks canceled the second season. Even though it is not on the level of the original it would have been better to watch than most of what's on.Vicious vs Fearless was a good idea."
Nudiustertian,"SEE YOU SPACE COWGIRL, SOMEDAY, SOMEWHERE!",10/10,20 November 2021,"First off, I just wanna point out that I don't care what the critics say. The original anime hits differently. Its impact is on another level so its not comparable to this. Therefore, there is no comparison between them cause they're not alike in terms of how the story is portrayed-I simply watch it as it is (or shall I say, I look at this as an alternate timeline). As an avid Cowboy Bebop fan since my childhood days, I'm just super grateful they made the live-action adaptation possible. Also, huge kudos for keeping the beloved OST's especially Mai Yamane's - ""The Real Folk Blues"" which is my all-time favorite anime ending theme. I definitely enjoyed the entirety of the show quite frankly. Thanks again Netflix, I've been waiting for this series my entire life.

shootingstarlucy,Not the anime but still great fun to watch.,7/10,21 November 2021,"Some will directly compare this to the original Anime however they need to let it go. I don't personally want a direct live action replacement of the original as I still watch the original. What this adaptation does however it keep the essence of the original but also bend the characters and stories in new ways. Is it the Cowboy Bebop we all know and love no is it still fun and a good watch? Hell yes!

kkohena-87068,Best Anime adaptation yet.,10/10,21 November 2021,"I loved the anime, but thought it ran a little long. I'm half way through the Netflix version, and it has solved my only problem with the original.This version is also darker and more mature than your original space cowboy.The reviews are mixed, but I think this distinction is between Anime fans and Not. People who don't enjoy anime may find this a bit campy. I feel bad for them because this has been a most welcome blast from the pastSee you Space Cowboy.

carsonmoore-09282,The low ratings didn't watch the anime,8/10,22 November 2021,"Yes. This show is corny and goofy With weird acting and questionable quirks... because they were true to the anime. My only negative is the castings, I do think they could have done a better job but you can tell that this was a love project trying to pay homage to the original and I respect that. If you liked the anime, I can't imagine you won't like this. (If you let go the casting thing)

LeParas-1,Another beloved IP ruined by Netflix...,3/10,24 November 2021,"I wonder if the inept dangerhaired clowns over at Netflix are payed by the number of ruined projects?Seriously, who greenlit this atrocity?Most of the dialogue is so bad it seems it was either written by a bot or a 12 year old. I've seen Highschool plays with better dialouges than this joke of a tv-show has.John ""I'm only in for the paycheck"" Cho and Daniella ""I'm acting like a plank of wood"" Pineda are not even phoning it in, so lazy and bad is their acting.Their action scene in the first episode on New Tijuana was so laughably bad it made me almost suffocate while laughing my southern end off..The only likeable character in this show is Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black, everbody else is just a laughing stock and I won't even get started about what they did to Gren.Vicious while being a multi-layered antagonist in the anime, is nothing but a useless clown in this newest Netflix nightmare. Why Netflix? Why?If you haven't done so already, go watch the anime it's way better and more fun to watch, than this pile of crap.Thanks for nothing, Netflix."
leejenkins04,Actually not bad,7/10,24 November 2021,"I'm a huge fan of the original anime. I'd strongly recommend watching it first. Otherwise this whole show will just feel out of place and strange. Because these types of story's and creativity only work in animes and are extremely difficult to create in live action. This adaption is actually made really well. But it can't be compared to the original. The casting id say is pretty good although feye and spike are a little old in this. Jet is pretty well done. Unfortunately because the anime is sooooo good it will never live up to people's expectations. Still yet to see an anime adaption that works better than the anime. Please don't do samurai champloo though.

tyrahel06,Good try ! But misses the Jam,8/10,22 November 2021,"Fun show for newcomers - could be disappointing for anime fan ... I ll still give it a 7 for the effort and the fun.The cast is doing good, haters can be picky but the main trio is doing fine.In fact Spike and especially Jet are doing incredibly... valentine is a little different from the anime but is still doing good considering the tone... as for ED lets not talk about it and its more for a season 2 if ever.I had fun revisiting this classic. And the show even made me laugh and have some good moment!But the main issue is = its not the right keynote !I hear the jazz , that why i rated it so ! They even hit a bunch of notes But the tempo is too high pitched... i m sad for this partIts not a real Bebop ...Bebop is a real tragedy a real intrigue punctuated by quircky fun moments yes ! But not all the time... it talks of difficults topics ! Here it kind of fly through them without talking or contempling seriously on those hard subjects.It s a little too much like a soap comedy... its not too bad at first but then the plot and the ""enemies"" and basically all the script make it so cheesy that its hard to really get gripped by the story but ! You do get attached to the main trio wich kind of make back some of it.I think the ""syndicats"" should have been better written and just visually bring a real more dark/ serious side to the story. Let the others be fun and the main more serious ? This could have help balanced the show.This whole point kinda break the show for me : Julia , Vicious and all changes ruins a lot of the mood and mystery.The first episode especially seems like a 100% soap comedy - wich probably is some of the reason of the backlash.I think newcomers would find it interesting if they like comedies or just a fun watch or old school cops/cowboy shows.Hope they are able to pull something out of this eventually.Big up netflix on trying to bring to life amazing anime / games and such but consider things carefully...Yuyu hakusho? Onepiece? I really dont think we are there yet... should probably find the good directors/teams to lead anime adaptation with easy stuff before going into deep fantasy anime show."
markglynn-82310,"Ignore the negativity, it's actually a fun watch.",9/10,19 November 2021,"This is really enjoyable and I'm a big fan of the anime. I don't get the hate, it keeps the feel of the original (Unlike a lot of anime adaptions) The actors are great, they keep the cheesy dialogue and style that the original has and they fit the roles really well.Don't listen to the review bombers, they're lives must be miserable if they can't appreciate a great homage and excuse to revisit the original series. Sure, it has it's differences, but why would anyone want a scene for scene recreation of something we already have?

taienverdain,Five episodes in and I love it,10/10,26 November 2021,"I was in my late teens in the 90s when this show was released and I have to once again dissent with popular opinion because I am finding this series amazing. There are so many perfect recreations of scenes from the anime (or at least single shots from the anime). I don't mind the story changes at all. The guy who plays Jet is AMAZING at recreating his voice to the letter. And who cares that the main character is played by an Asian? An Asian wrote the story. He does a GREAT job of being Spike.I am loving this series.

spectradatum,Gave me all the emotional ups and downs of the original.,10/10,20 November 2021,"And then some.I am pleased with what they were able to accomplish. I refrained from having any expectations whatsoever. I did not rewatch the original beforehand.Visuals are great. Story is great.Would I have changed a couple of elements if I had made it? Sure, but nobody is giving me millions to produce such a work.It was bold to try and do a live action out of this work. They nailed it on the soundtrack. Top notch. They nailed it on the visual presentation. They did great on the writing, in that they maintained the same sense of humor (for the most part) while adding a few layers of complexity to the story line.Great effort. Look forward to what they do next.Knockin on Heaven's Doors? If they did this good on the show, I look forward to a reboot of the movie."

jordancornally-84720,Guys I am shocked at how good this show is!!!,10/10,21 November 2021,"If you know me You know how fair I am and honest I am when it comes to reviews. I am big into anime and especially the cowboy bebop anime. So when it comes to live action adaptations of anime I am very harsh. But I am Genuinely shocked at how well this live action adaptation turned out. The rating doesn't justify how good it actually is. I really enjoyed this show. Give it a watch. The reason why people are bashing on it is the same reason there is always hate on movies and shows. They just do it out of hate and most didn't even watch it. For me I am hard on Anime Live adaptations but this one is actually good. Give it a watch I reckon most of you will enjoy it :) Edit : They change a few thing but not for the worst in my opinion :D.

poinla,I wanted so much to like this :'(,1/10,19 November 2021,"Ok, so first of all, I really enjoyed the anime as a kid, got some weird tune that made it so special.About this remake:
-I like the music (but I'm into jazz and it's the same tune from the anime so cool)
-The FX, setups, environments are quite decent. It's not as good as some series from Disney + for instance, but they tried to keep that space punk/western/oriental vibe.And... that's mostly all the positive aspects....
-The cast is... weird.... I don't mind that much Jet being black, I know they had to put some more woke in this show, and all in all, it not that weird. But Faye is a total disappointment! The actress' square shaped face and manners are too far from the character....
-The acting is awful, especially the secondary characters...
-The screenplay, pace and editing choices are really bland, uninspired and the action scenes are so generic (actually, not only the action scenes) that it gets really boring....
Well, I could go on, but to sum up, it is just a huge disappointment....
If you don't know Cowboy bebop, I suggest you watch the anime instead.Another miss for Netfilx, but no surprise, Netflix is no longer a streaming platform that produces great series, it just want the money, no matter if they stop a great series or ruin an amazing story."
DarkLead,A disgrace to the Anime,1/10,25 November 2021,"It is unbelievable how they threw away so much of the anime and replaced it with this.The anime was a big part of my childhood and it teached me a lot of lessons that I learned nowhere else, not from my parents, not from teachers or other adults, but from an anime.And it hurts to see the masterpiece that is the anime be tainted by this horrible Netflix adaptation.

It's got an over the top campy vibe that may be off-putting to some die hard fans of the original, but I personally thought it worked really well. Don't go in expecting a flawless 1:1 remake, but it was a cool, fun retelling that tried to do its own thing, and for the most part, succeeded.

roel-coppens,"Forgot the anime for one second, this is pretty good!",8/10,26 November 2021,"Its a good serie. I get it why the point is low, every real life action serie made from an anime is in the eyes of the anime fans bad. But really its good! Good actors, character development, pretty funny scenes/nice humour. Also many scènes look very nice considering the budget.

RandomTard,Pretty weak,3/10,8 February 2022,"These kind of shows really aren't my cup of tea, but I endured the whole first and only season. What this show really to me is, is a remix of some movies/series from late 90's and 00's like Kill bill and others that were popular at the time. This dark cartoon ninja mafia style for me is totally out dated and done to death.This particular show also does things wrong. The story seems to be mostly stolen bits from other shows (when watching the computer simulation episode you're gonna start wondering when are they gonna do timeloop episode). Even the jazzthingy is such an old cliche that it's just unneccessary annoyance.The actors are ok apart for the guy playing Spike/Fearless, he really should decide which is he gonna try to imitate - Bruce Lee or Johhny Depp. At least it looks ok and the sounds are somewhat balanced.

bishopexcons,#savecowboybebop,8/10,10 December 2021,"I am deeply saddened and disappointed with the cancellation. I have really enjoyed the season. The characters, the plot and the visual section made this a very funny series. And it was only the beginning. It may not be like the anime, but it is an adaptation. It does not have to be the same. Giving this series one star is childish and mean. I hope will be rescued.

owenpont-70803,"Ok, this is my personal opinion.............",8/10,27 December 2021,"But I think this show is awesome. Now its not better than the anime of course, but man this is entertaining as heck. I think the people who criticize this show over Ed, the plots being the same are just either gate keepers, or people who won't be pleased with anything related to live action reboots. I think all the characters were memorable just like the shows of course. And sure the plot is the same, but its a REBOOT, they would keep it the same so that they can do more with it with the 2nd season. The did change the ending which i thought was very clever and I didn't expect it at all. And sure I am probably being way to nice to this show, but people are being way to over the top with criticism to this show. Live action reboots of anime won't be as good as the anime, so don't go in them and expecting for them to be better. Just go in them expecting for them to be entertaining. Because this one is entertaining and should get a second season without a doubt.

jaxx-68100,Surprisingly Entertaining,9/10,27 November 2021,"I never once considered looking at the anime series of 'Cowboy Bebop' before watching this live action version, and it took me 4 separate attempts to get past the first episode of this new series. During the first 3 attempts I fell asleep halfway through the first episode-that was because I was looking for something to watch during the waning minutes of consciousness. Finally, I woke up one Saturday morning with no place to go and started watching the first episode for the 4th time, and by midday Sunday, I had binged my way through the entire first season. I then started skimming through the anime series for context on the story, its characters and to find out how Radical Ed figured into the show. I really like this motley crew, the adventures they get into and the colorful characters in the series. It's fun escapism, and John Cho is excellent as Spike Spiegel. Please let there be a second season, I am looking forward to seeing the addition of Radical Ed to the crew and the performance of the young actress in that role. If I can make one criticism/request, dump the down and out, broke and hungry, loser stereotype who can never catch a break. It will not hurt the show if they come out on the top sometimes. They do not have to be the best bounty hunters out there but at the least let them be successful at it. Watching the heroes of the show always come out of a contest with the short end of the stick gets old pretty quick. I have already noticed that, and I don't like it. That notwithstanding, I really enjoyed season 1."
mrartist,I'm impressed,9/10,23 November 2021,"I wasn't sure how John Cho would play out spike but he nailed the character through the season. Overall it is a great live action of one of my favorite anime shows growing up.

roxymurg,Abs loved it!,9/10,23 November 2021,"John Cho is so amazing as Spike Spiegel!! I loved the anime back in the nineties and was reluctant to watch the live action but oh boy, was I about to get surprised!! The music is amazing as always, the scenery, the selection of set colours, the chi!! Everything is perfection, the only reason why I gave it a 9 and not a 10 is because I wanted to see more bounty hunting as they did in the anime, but everything else was really entertaining and enjoyable!!!!

wesleyvanauken,Actors did their best with abysmal writing.,1/10,2 January 2022,"I honestly felt insulted by how bad the writing is in this series. They pulled another ""Locke and Key"" here. They're shooting for that demographic that has an IQ below room temperature and they are shooting for it HARD. It's starting to seem like ""rewriting an existing excellent story-boarded script to be consumed by those who are as dumb as a stump"" is Netflix's big thing. As long as the money keeps rolling in from idiots why bother with anything more?

masterchibi-22046,Bloated,4/10,25 November 2021,"This thing focuses on too many storylines and does most of them poorly. It changes things in ways that barely make any sense story wise just because it can and not in service to the story which just makes it up much poor experience. Characters that had emotional weight to them, like Gren, are made pointless because it would be too risky to tell a story about a man who was experimented on and tortured with drugs that twisted their bodies. Vicious is a joke in every way, and it suffers from tonal dissonance. Jet despite being played so well wasn't given much to do other pining for the life he could have had. Valentine's backstory and personality was changed so much that she might as well have been another character all together.Over all it's just not a fun time. It takes itself way too seriously when it shouldn't and too lightly when it should.

It had great actors, fun stories, and changed enough plot points to keep me super interested... nobody wants a shot for shot remake, lolWhat is missed, and maybe the most important part of the original, was the general slow pace and sense of ennui that the original made the audience feel.Also, it got to the BIG plot very fast. I guess to make an exciting 10 episode conclusion. I hope it slows down for season 2 and let's us enjoy the listlessness.

gtkr-175-73045,Almost Good!,1/10,19 November 2021,"Not as terrible as the fanboys are saying but it falls short. If you haven't seen the anime which is absolutely awesome, you might like this show but still you'd be left feeling the stories are not great.There's so many amazing things on this adaptation like the music, photography, some of the fight scenes and the visuals but miscasting one of the main characters 'Faye Valentine' is unforgiveable. I have nothing against the actress but she's just not Faye and that alone takes so many points off the production. Why create so many awesome sets and visuals to ruin it all miscasting one of the best characters.I'm aware that 99.9% of us can't write a 5min scene but c'mon! The writing should've been on par with the music and the visuals which is usually what ruins every production. Writers you had one job and one of the greatest source materials in this genre, what happened?Overall definitely not unwatchable but as a fan of the anime I just wish they would've match the writing to the visuals and music, would have been a way better show. For that and a crappy Faye I'm giving a low rating and that makes me feel a bit sad.BTW you know who would have made a waaaay better Faye?Jamie Alexander, Krysten Ritter, Willa Holland, Eva Green, Jessica De Gouw, Katrina Law, Hayley Atwell, Evangeline Lilly, Chyler Leigh, Amy Jackson, Katie McGrath, Olivia Wilde, Olivia Munn, Olga Kurylenko....The list goes onSpend millions on sets, music and amazing visuals and not even give Faye her beautiful green eyes? How much a set of green contacts cost? Huge Mistake."

jasonsgk,Inauthentic and campy but you gotta love that Corgi,4/10,19 November 2021,"I remember accidentally catching Cowboy Bebop in the middle of the night as a teenager and like all who loved the series believing that you secretly stumbled on a unique, subversive anime that created new themes and broke molds of the genre. The first episode I saw was Toys in the Attic, and thinking back to that episode specifically it highlighted the major issue I have in this remake. The original felt clever and experimental. This conversely feels entirely ingenious. To simply remake the scenes from the anime into a Live action it doesn't pay homage, instead it feels extremely lame, campy and childish. Reminiscent more of the Wachowski's Speed Racer remake than Cowboy Bebop. The original new material they added, being a deep dive into Spike was cheesy and if we're being totally honest, a boring tromp in the boring syndicate storyline.The biggest issue however was without a doubt the casting. Spike didn't feel right. While he was clearly the only one who could actually act, he didn't seem right and it's hard to put my finger on why. He was too old, too soft, too unconvincing to play the Bruce Lee like quintessential cool guy. Instead he felt like Harold on his way to a hunt a bounty at the White Castle. Jet was the most reminiscent of his original character, albeit he was originally of French decent in the series. I mean an African American actor playing a character named Jet Black almost feels like a joke from Semi-Pro. That was definitely not the issue with his character at all though and honestly he was one I was genuinely looking forward to seeing in the role. No, the problem there was that he was one of the most inept actors I've ever seen. Sounded just like him but the dude could not act. And you know what, those two were the best characters. The worst was Faye Valentine. She was unbearable. The acting, the dialogue. Heck, she didn't even kind of look like her. If I saw a picture of her outside the context of the show I would assume it's a new Netflix show about coffee baristas who want to break into being a graphic artist. She's a like a Gen Z stereotype reimagined as a cartoon toughie. And why a race swap? She was already Asian in the show. Why now a gap toothed Latina who by the way, looks white? The costume wasn't even the same colors. This one was like space bus driver palette. Every scene she was in she was awful and made the scene worse by her participation in it.So here's another weird repeating and annoying thing Netflix does: lighting. The original show had a melancholy to it, no doubt, but it wasn't monotone. This one is dark, as in not bright, to the point some scene actually have a shadowed circular frame like I'm watching it through a peephole. The cinematography is not great either. The saving grace? The stunts are worse. They are so poorly done, I'm the first episode when they are being sucked out the hole in the wall I was reminded of the scene when the main actor fell from the window in Hitchcock's Rear Window.That said, the jazz music (albeit way overused to the point of feeling like your sitting a pretentious professors office. Like I get it man, you like chai tea, can we turn this pseudo intellectual stuff off now?) ships and what not were pretty spot on. They did a good job replicating many of the iconic visual and musical elements of the original series. But given the episodes were longer and big budget I think that was really the basic entry fee so I can only give some credit since it didn't feel like an homage but a rewrite.The last comment I'll say is remember how cool Darth Vader was? You remember the mystique of a character they didn't overuse? Well, Netflix forgot and I hope you like Viscous, because there's a lot of him.Truthfully, I was going to give the series 2/10 but Ein is still as awesome as ever and I can't overlook that."
senapasin-70223,It has the soul,9/10,26 November 2021,"I would take a screenshot of each scene and make it my wallpaper, if not hang it on my wall.This one has the style, the look, the music, the vibe. I really liked what they did here.

Apollotick,Fan of anime and very with this new version,10/10,26 November 2021,"Very entertaining. Not a one to one with anime but its enough to make it work and still keep the iconic feel and moments of the anime.I know some are upset about the changes in some of the characters story and the cast. I don't see how you can make a perfect replica of the characters. Especially Faye. Its unrealistic to fine a woman that has her bust size and her waist size. Then there is the clothing she wore. Just ridiculous to think there is a life like version of that.As for the character story it really isn't an issue it is still entertaining.

draculard,"Less good than the anime, but okay",6/10,19 November 2021,"After having watched the first episode I would say that it's a disappointment but not a major one. The show takes more time to tell the same stories with less style and less substance. Trying to tie the thing together with an overarching plot too early steals loses some of the joy of the original. Jet Black is great.They made a lot of choices in this show that made it more generic, and less unique which feels sad when you consider that the creator set out to make something people hadn't really seen when making the show.I edited this review and my score four times while watching the series going from enjoying it, to annoyed at what they had changed and made worse, to being a little sad about the loss, and ultimately on to acceptance of what it is:
Worse than the anime but not terrible, reasonable fun but with less depth.One last note the way they did Ed was so bad it was upsetting."

JustinSookram,I actually like this better than original,9/10,30 November 2021,"It's a lot more fun dialogue between Spike, Jet and Faye. I remember the cartoon being super cool but dry dialogue. This live action adaptation has more life, literally. I do see where the casting can disappoint fans... I think Jet is perfectly casted.Besides that I think the aesthetics are good and the feel of the future fits the description of the anime.

asterblasterth,Low budget,8/10,27 November 2021,"When I started watching I thought: what is this low budget and cheap show? Then it got me interested to keep watching and then another episode and in the end I saw all ten of them.I have to say I quite enjoyed it. Like I said at the beginning it bothered me that it has this low budget vibe about it and amateurish fight scenes but as the episodes went on I realized it's part of the vibe of the show. As a whole I liked it.

elijah-alcantara,2 points for the visuals,2/10,7 December 2021,"I just can't finish it... I stopped at around 5-6 episodes... I mean what, what the heck did they do to our Vicious... they made him so so lame. Every other reviewer has mentioned the bad cast and forced acting, none of them looked comfortable, so that's that.And those anime episodes that makes you think about life in general? Nope, not here. Soul-less copies. You will not carry that weight here.

dmholloway-18633,Cowboy BeFlop,5/10,24 July 2022,"I decided to give this a watch as i was looking for something new. I was unaware that it was originally an anime until my son told me so i am not familiar with the source material.I feel the show is quite pretentious with its garish mixture of styles and fashions and some of the dialogue that i feel was directed to be performed in a wooden manner as an almost inward satire.It's a though every shot is trying to be a defining image of the show.I enjoy when the story focuses on Jet as i think he is a more interesting, likeable, not so self-centred character. I don't give a damn about Spike and his past and Vicious looks like something out of Twilight or Harry Potter.I found the first 3 episodes enjoyable but after that i found myself skipping over scenes with pointless, time filling dialogue. I don't know if Faye is gay in the original but i found it incredibly predictable that an independent woman who is left alone with another independent woman would turn into a half-hearted sex scene.I thought TV was supposed to be past that!The stories quickly became genre confused and episodic with a poor attempt to tie it together with an intermittent story arc that you can be forgiven if your forget it even existed.I haven't even finished the series. And i am unlike to."
dgccw,Enjoyed it much more than I thought I would,7/10,23 November 2021,"Having seen the original show and movie, I do have to say I'm more pleased with this adaptation than I thought I would be. The critics and rabid fans have bashed it, but the team that put this together did it respectfully and were able to make it feel like it IS Cowboy Bebop.I do have a few gripes in regards to the mystery that was Spike in the originals vs his back story laid bare in the Live version. I think we could have waited for a few characters to appear until a hopeful season 2.

hatsuharu55,"A Jolly, Good Ride!",8/10,9 April 2023,"Of the various live-action adaptations of anime that I have yet seen, this one has done the best in staying true to the essence of the anime, all while making it still feel believable! I don't remember there being so much gore in the anime, but it has been quite some time since I've watched it, so I could be wrong there. I loved that they kept the intro the same, and the humor is great! The actors did a fantastic job (for live-action anime, that's no easy feat!), and the set and graphics stayed true to the gritty style of the anime as well! I was quite pleased! My only complaint, especially since a very prominent character makes their appearance at the very end of the show, is that there is no second season! PLEASE MAKE A SECOND SEASON!!! Or at least a nice movie that will wrap it up with all the characters having their time to shine.

matthewguess-25587,Awful live action interpretation.,1/10,26 November 2021,"I'm utterly convinced the high star reviews here are either paid for or not fans of the original anime. This was one of the poorest executions of a live action anime. Cowboy Bebop is so well done as an anime, it should have been extremely easy to import to live action.Instead the writers clearly looked over cliff notes of each character, and thought no one would notice. I'm utterly disgusted with the outcome of this trash. They had a great cast and still couldn't execute.Anyone who's saying this was a good cowboy bebop adaption, is out of their mind.

bgsmall,'This is the return of the space cowboy....' ;-),8/10,30 December 2021,"Viewed on a friends recommendation and glad I did.This is a somewhat 'tongue-in-cheek' and it has an easy, dare I say it louche presentation of a pair of bounty hunters who roam the galaxy looking or a easy payout, of whom hides a slightly darker secret - that he once worked for the 'syndicate' (ruthless baddies), his partner being an ex-cop, who once hunted members of the syndicate.I like the quirky, jazz themed (redolent of 1930's private detective pulp fiction) and futuristic environments. This will definitely appeal to fans of sci-fi.

keiths29,Needs time,7/10,26 November 2021,"This is a very flawed live action version of the anime. After years of waiting for a live action version, this is a big disappointment. With that said, I would love a second season. The characters were just getting fleshed out. Faye acted like Faye for the first time in the last episode. The character arcs are just getting interesting. I think a second season would give them time to develop. John Cho seemed like a bad choice, too goofy to play Spike. In the end he did okay.As for the style, it's a bit off. The style choices are comic for such a dark toned series. Would have liked a more John Wick vibe and less cartoony. John Cho seemed like an odd choice, but was okay by the end. Mustafa does a good job with Jet, best of the casting choices. The fight scenes are lacking gravitas. Again a second season would give them a chance to redeem the show. None of the characters had time to develop. Funny how the live action was so two dimensional.Lastly, bringing in Ed in the last minute of the last episode is a bit disappointing. Ed was a big part of the Bebop, should have introduced earlier.All in all, fair, not good, but has potential. Netflix, give it a second season and give it a decent budget, I'll watch."
doctordbx,I never watched the anime so I am enjoying this thoroughly,8/10,26 November 2021,"I'll probably go back and watch the anime after this, but so far 8 episodes in and I am enjoying everything about this show.Any criticism of it being cheesy, corny, space westerny, physics defying etc. I put in the same category of criticisms of shows that have space wizards with laser swords not being deeply constructed physics based space dramas. You can't please everyone!Overall though it is FUN, and INTERESTING and gets the IMAGINATION flowing... so naturally most people these days won't like that sort of stuff.

HazelNutFunny,"Don't wanna see you again, Space Cowboy ...",1/10,30 November 2021,"As a huge fan of the anime I was hoping for a good real-life adaption for a long time. When I heard that Netflix started developing the adaption I was already a little worried, but sadly now I'm more disappointed than expected.I think the main problem of the adaption is the tone: The anime had a mature tone and often a quite dark color-palette, especially compared to most other anime-shows. The Netflix-version on the other hand has very bright, colorful feeling and the sets seemed much to clean and artificial, especially for a real-life-show. Therefore the Netflix-version sadly feels more like the adaption of a cartoon-show and not like Shinichiro Watanabe anime-masterpiece.What the directors got completely wrong, is that you have to reduce energy and drive from an anime when you want to convert it to a real-life-version, otherwise everything feels over-the-top and unnatural.While the casting on stills looked quite promising, they also got the tone and feeling of most of the characters wrong.I think that Alex Hassell is a good actor, but the directors used him as if Vicious was a cartoon-villian and in some parts he reminded me more of Gargamel from the ""Smurfs""-cartoon and less of Vicious from the anime.Although I am a fan of John Cho's work and found him as a perfect fit as Spike on photographs, on the scene I found his over-the-top-coolnes not natural at all and most of the time simply annoying. I think he gave his best but is sadly not a good fit for the role.While I found most actors not bad per se, sadly Elena Satine as Julia was really really bad and felt like she was part of a Lady Gaga-Biopic.On the other hand Mustafa Shakir as Jet and Daniella Pineda as Fay felt really good to me and did a great job. Jet was for me always the heart of the Bebop and they delivered this perfectly and Pineda as Fay acted perfectly quirky, mean and nice at the same time.I don't know why they made war-veteran Gren to a dancing-teacher and don't even wanna start on their version of Ed. I just hope that this was the last we saw of that experiment and Watanabe makes another anime-film instead.The saddest thing is that this version destroys the legacy of the anime-series. Now when I hear somebody says that he is a fan of ""Cowboy Bebop"", I will never know if he means the great anime show or if I better leave the room as soon as possible."
fmatt99,Something to watch if you have nothing else to do!,6/10,22 December 2021,"John Cho is a Supporting Actor thrust into the lead role in this 10 episode Netflix drama about Bounty Hunters who never collect a Bounty.Most of the characters in this remake of an Italian original are interestingly drawn, but not in a very interesting way.Tamara Tunie, A Martinez lend their talents to this tale that just doesn't take you anywhere.Cinematography is good, Direction is adequate, but the story is unappealing.The American-Japanese prodduction collaboration is interesting, but in the end you just want this killemall mess to end.

anna01010,I liked it,8/10,27 December 2021,"I hadn't seen the anime, so I went into this without an opinion. I really did like it though, so much so, that I watched the anime right afterward. I can see why some folks feel like John Cho just wasn't quite capturing Spike Spiegel, but I don't think it's for lack of skill. John Cho was phenomenal, as always. I don't just don't think that the character translates to live performance. Anime allows for next-level nonchalance. When real people try to capture that though, they look uncaring and aloof, like jerks. I'm sorry this got cancelled. I think it would have grown on people in time.

Roogatsby,MOO,1/10,27 November 2021,"If somebody told me these were amateur cosplayers who self-produced an homage to their favorite anime I would be kinda impressed ...but this is a Netflix joint. It is a half-baked rehashing of the anime series, often beat for beat, and the overall tone feels like it is mocking the original anime, not bringing it to life. Actually I think you might like it if you are into ""post-irony"" or Lisa Frank or Fyre Island or cryptocurrency. But if you want some genuine, good live action intergalactic hilarity try Red Dwarf or Firefly or Mandolorian or the BBC version of Hitchhiker's Guide.Cowboy Beflop is like a generic artificial grape flavored beverage when what you really wanted was red wine. Or heck even a wine cooler would've been nice. . .but girl this ain't even Faygo. Well at least the OST is brilliant, it is worth enduring all that bloated kitsch just to let your ears get a glimpse of that Seatbelt magic.

Sandre-Monroe,an impossible task! Why this show failed in 4 facts :,3/10,21 November 2021,"The tv show is correct at best, but it is not a good scifi show.Narratives are very flat, acting are not good at all and kill the show,
combat are slow and lack realism, musics do not match the pictures.There is always ""in each scene"" something who looks like fake and break the realism for us to put our mind inside and be absorbed by the show.The worst part for me is the body language of the main cast (heroes and bad guys) who are very bad. The words who came to my mind when i saw the entire show was : ""how is that possible, the director do not manage the actors properly to get something who do not look like as fake acting""They ALL do too much when not needed, and, do not enough when needed. At each scene, every time.But why ? Why this show failed in 4 facts :1) They have as reference the original animated tv show and try to copy it, what is impossible to reproduce with real actors. Or you need to put a lot more budget into it, and take more time to manage the actors.2) Directors and writers of this tv show do not have the knowledge and references needed to do a good job. Bad casting, bad choices, bad writing and no knowledge and understanding of the original universe, will not give us anything new and memorable at the end.3) For anyone who watch the original show, it is a bust, because in our mind, it was masterpiece. Then this show fight a ghost, an idea, a memory.No one win against a memory you will always loose against it, because memory for everyone are perfect. They need to re construct the original to re create new memories, new ideas. And they failed badly trying to copy cat the original what is at best a bad idea at worst a direct way to oblivion.4) Cowboy bebop universe is rich and have a lot of potential, like blade runner, cyberpunk, altered carbon and so on ... why copy something when you can create around and add more. I wish they have created something new or remade something like Marvel done with Avenger.Comic books do not looks like the movies but the workaround was a real success using the original materials.Because of this 4 facts, they failed horribly and create something who will just forgotten in no time. Too bad the writers and director do a bad job to reconstruct something credible around this universe."
katanaroseparks,Don't compare this with the anime,5/10,10 December 2021,"Don't compare this with the anime two different shows I am afraid this doesn't live up to the hype to bad this was a great idea how ever the changes to the characters were sad to say the least & don't get me started on the story line which was all over the place no big surprise it was canceled I predicted it after I got finished watching it you can always tell when a remake isn't going to make it rest in piece live action Cowboy Bebop made those who try it again learn from your mistakes.

ted-cooper,"A faithful translation of the original anime, with some new flavor on top",9/10,20 November 2021,"This show is a riot.Netflix really went for it, adapting some elements verbatim from the original (frame by frame recreations of some iconic scenes) while taking liberties to give fans something fresh to watch.I don't know what some reviewers are looking for out of a show these days... This thing is a roller coaster, with great action, funny dialogue, and real heart.

worksmart-58506,Once again a group of morons dooms a great show,10/10,10 December 2021,"People who can't get over themselves and out of their own way have once again doomed a brilliant artistic effort to the scrap heap.This live action version was an absolute pleasure to watch, and integrated far more of the magic from the original than i even thought possible. Anyone saying they couldn't watch more than 10 minutes are nothing but trolls or haters of reality in general. Anyone saying it's boring needs to go back out trophy hunting with their AR -15. Anyone complaining about the music should go back to their mom's basement and crank some more Iron Maiden. Anyone saying John Cho was older than Spike and so ruined the program for them, needs to take a good look in the mirror and reevaluate life.Wanna see a truly terrible live action version of a cherished anime....look no further than Bleach. Bebop deserves 50 academy awards in comparison. Those responsible for getting this program prematurely and unceremoniously axed should be ashamed of themselves."
elettrozero,A perfect chance thrown away,5/10,19 November 2021,"I'm a huge fan of the original anime and this remake looks more like a fresh out the school director attempt. Camera shots, lights, chroma keys and lines are poorly directed and executed. I noticed the effort in giving more details and lines to all the characters but most of the times it brakes the peace. I'm big fan of John Cho and he quite fits the suite of Spike but the performance is not quite there. I'd rather went for new stories instead of making simpler versions of the original ones.

nsbsnvp,Obscenely Good!,9/10,13 April 2023,"Firstly, I should point out that it is not a direct live action production of the anime, nor it intends to be. It's more of its own thing inspired and reflected upon by the original anime.However, it can really hold its ground, within the first episode you've already got a foundation for not only the plot of the series but the characters stories, the lore around the world and even the themes it will delve into. It hits the ground running and never stops. It has some insane production values, with costuming, set design and even music composition being ferociously good. It's a forefront runner for one of the best shows on television from the 2020s.

enderazophie-06603,Forced myself to watch all 10 episodes,2/10,9 January 2022,"The saddest part of this series is that first episode is so great. Then the second episode happened... this series somehow gets worse and worse until it ends. By the third episode I was hate-watching it, just to see how badly they messed up the whole thing. It seems like they had a completely different script for a show, and inserted the Cowboy Bebop characters into it. I'm not an insane person who believes every live-action adaptation of anime had to be a shot for shot remake, or even retain all the same characteristics: but this show is just bad on its face. The actress who plays Faye cannot act, plain and simple, and she was written to have the comedic prowess of a middle school girl. Her one-liners fare so cringe and poorly delivered, it literally makes you smack your head. And there is a glaring lack of chemistry between the lead actors. Also Julia's wig is distracting and obviously a wig. While the small amount of computer graphics looked great in this show, they did not do a good job on the sets or the backgrounds. But the number one sin for this show is the script. I don't understand how production teams can read these scripts and think it sounds good. Maybe get some people on your team that will say ""no"" to you. Such a dumpster fire of a show. The only good things were basically all of episode 1, the computer graphics looked very good, and I laughed exactly twice. Also the portrayal of Vicious was genuinely very good, not accurate to the anime, but good in its own right by whoever the actor was who played him."
dandhyoon,"If you're a fan of the anime, you will not like this version",5/10,20 November 2021,"If you haven't seen the original masterpiece, this will be passably entertaining. Not great in any way, but with enough production value to be worthy of your time.As a fan though, I had two main misgivings:1. The cast doesn't measure up. They lack charisma and style, especially the two main leads who play Spike and Faye. Harold with a six pack just didn't do it for me.2. The tone of the series is unconvincing. The original was funny, sad, hot, cold, raw, emotional - lots of ups and downs. This version is just bland and lukewarm.7 for first time viewers, 3 (for Ein) for us fans for an average of 5.

swettian,This was a butchery,1/10,6 December 2021,"Gren was the worst. First off there didn't need to be scenes at all for the background of Vicious and Julia. They turned Gren's character from a proud soldier who had been tested on to a showgirl working at a drag bar. That's the other thing that gets me the syndicate spends all this time at a so called dive bar that looks like every drag bar I've ever been to. The only background needed for Vicious character was that he saved Gren on Titan and comes back to kill Gren. Julia was absolutely awful. She looked like a Scott Pilgrim character. She wasn't even a true blonde or even play the badass character that she was. Vicious is a large step down as well. They turned him from a soldier that fought in the war to a whiny son of an elder to the syndicate. The scene where Spike kills the rival syndicate because Vicious is being whiny was terrible. Also why was the syndicate a group of 1000s worried about 50 men in a building calling themselves a crime organization that Spike killed all on his own? Completely useless story filler.On the Bebop all the characters were far more playful with each other than their previous counterparts. They're going bowling and getting drinks. No they were all isolated people that found each other that didn't interact as well with each other unless they needed to. Spike and Fay specifically feel way too playful. Ed was Ed, but a cartoon character such as that doesn't translate well to live action. With all the butchery they should have cut the character entirely."
wpmcg,Great new show from Netflix ...Aaaaand it's cancelled.,9/10,14 December 2021,"Having no familiarity with the source material, I could appreciate this on it's own merits, and not in comparison. Thoroughly enjoyed it, except for the fact I already knew they jumped to cancel it, citing the huge cost of production. Should have made it a mini-series instead of leaving us hanging.

Netflix went and Netflixed Cowboy Bebop! The meme is now reality once more!

les-180,Don't listen to the die hard Manga reviews!,10/10,26 November 2021,"Firstly, I have not seen the original cartoon version, so, if your like me, watch this and you will absolutely LOVE this series.... It is AWESOME!!!Im actually going to watch the manga version when I have completed this, because if its half as good as this, it will be brilliant!!.I get really frustrated when die hard fans of an original series, this being a cartoon, slate something to death and leave bad reviews because of their perspective of the new version!!! Take this for what it is!!! It has brilliant characters, played beautifully. The cinematography and effects are stunning and the story line is great and extremely humorous.If you like recent Marvel series such as Loki and Wanda Vision, you will absolutely LOVE this.... Ignore the Manga, cartoon head critics and give this a try. I seriously cannot fault it in any way and was really shocked to such low rating... I really think people expect too much these days, and criticise far too easily.... However, this is NOT one to be criticised.... Get off your high cartoon horses!!!There's my review. Its brilliant, NO I don't work for the studios and know any of the actors... Its a genuine review from someone that absolutely loved the show.TC Les."
dragracer1260,Another cancelled show,9/10,5 February 2022,"I had never heard of this show before.I don't do animation.I thought the show was great, different from the normal sci-fi, good characters, not a bad storey line.Now I read its been cancelled after only 1 season.Sounds to me like Firefly all over again.I'm not quite sure what these TV execs are actually looking for in a show these days.Just a shame we didn't get a season 2 to finish it all off rather than just cancelling it."
saliaga08,Brilliant and should be the cornerstone of live action anime,10/10,20 November 2021,"Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime I watched as a child and it inspired me to become an actual ""Bounty Hunter"" Netflix followed the anime really closely imo and the actors portrayed the characters magnificently. Anyone who says anything different is straight up wrong. This is how you make a live action adaptation.

I applaud that they did seem to get the overall ""feel"" of the original, but they just changed so much about each character that they were only recognizable by look. I didn't love the characters because of how they look.... they had a perfect outline of how to make a great show but they thought they could do better. They didn't.

samisezin,Stands on its own for me and is pretty good.,7/10,23 November 2021,"I don't like anime at all. So for me I judge this show like it stands on its own. Not as a remake of an anime show. And on its own it is a pretty good show! I like this style of sci-fi. A bit of a dark vibe but not dystopian. And it has great music, great action, good storylines. Not a top show but give it a chance, it will grow on you. They use the word cowboy in a certain way and it has a bit of a raw wild west feel but is not a space western. Go watch and be surprised!

mylesallanson,Unfairly Judged,8/10,21 November 2021,"Seeing more outrage than the live action movie adaptation of ghost in the shell and this is actually great in comparison.I've seen reviews of people saying they were die hard fans of the anime and then saying ""oh and the music is terrible"" - ermmm did you see the original series/ know what bebop means?Yes Cho as spike wouldn't of been my first pick either, he doesn't really have a similar or at least relatable facial structure. HOWEVER I think his depiction of Spike as a character is excellent. You also have to think that this is Netflix. They needed a familiar face if they wanted to get any traction from people who weren't original fans of the anime. That means a recognisable face even if it is them viewer saying ""hey isn't that the guy from Harold and Kumar""?Visually this show is stunning, they've kept the gritty feel of the anime. With regards to the
special effects team on this, hats off because it was beautifully executed. As well as the action sequences being both exciting and almost frame by frame copies of some of the fights I remember from the show.This show isn't without its flaws but if you watched the original it could also get dull on some episodes, feel a bit cheesy and have the disappointing outcomes when once again the crew loses out on a bounty.This shows cheap thrills. Don't go into it expecting a replica of the original show because it is impossible.I'm 3 episodes down and enjoying it. I went in with no expectations but as a show It's Good! It's not the wire or game of thrones but I'm genuinely enjoying it.When has any anime adaptation not had outrage in fairness? I think out of the ones I've seen so far this has done the best job at keeping a lot of the source material, making it engaging and still giving it a unique visual style. As well as creating a new and exciting show that lets hope gets more of the mainstream audience to watch the original show."
willhardwick,Just fun,8/10,29 November 2021,"Never seen the anime so maybe it is a flawless masterpiece in comparison to this live action remake which is very good but certainly no all timer.However, even if I had seen the original, I hope I wouldn't be so short sighted as to let that taint my opinion of what is an enjoyable show. It's dynamic and exciting with memorable characters that are well acted (except the main antagonist but he's not on screen enough for it to ruin things). Well shot and with a great soundtrack too.Not much too complain about at all. Just settle down with no expectations and you'll enjoy the ride.

xaviercrystian,Spontaneous action filled fun,8/10,20 November 2021,"This show is filled with captivating action, and very well written dialogue. The Character are perfect and portrayed well by the actors, it has an original style and tone different from the show, but still has that low fast paced Jazz feel to the show. People who disliked the casting just wanted a white washed bounty hunter, John Cho was perfect for this role, and so was the rest of the cast. The action scenes are great and very well stylized. The character interactions are unique and have their own interpretation that doesn't stray too far from the feel of the original anime. Overall a very solid show, hope to see more from it in the future.

Not sure what the original content consisted of ;but I feel this show should be able to stand on it's own regardless.Being the first season, I give the few shortcomings a pass and think if given future seasons the show will develop into something really great.Some people may mistake the touch of cheesiness to be due to poor production ;but it's part of the art style of the show (probably the original source material as well).I really hope the show is given the chance to further develop the world and story they've laid out this season.

jonnsz,"Shame it didn't get given a proper chance, fun show.",9/10,26 May 2023,"I actually really enjoyed this show, have watched it through a couple of times. Its the kind of fun action sci fi show we don't get much of anymore. Would have loved to have seen a second season.Great performances all round, i'll go against the grain and say that Pineda was awesome and brought a lot of balance to the trio.I cancelled my Netflix subscription not long after this as they just keep cancelling good shows after a season and yet other much worse shows just go on for what feels like forever.At least the season was fairly self contained and rounded out the main arc, even if it did end on a somewhat sour note.Shame no other network was willing to pick it up, it had a lot of potential."

louis1011,Fun but not great,6/10,20 November 2021,This show starts off really well. They establishing characters quickly and they feel faithful to the original. The dynamic of the crew feels faithful to the original early on but as the show goes on the feel more like a family compared to the original and I don't think it works that well.The action in the show is decent. It captures the tone of the original show but there are too many quick cuts. The music does make the action flow really well.My main fault with the show was the story. In the original it had a very loose story that never really played a big part but in this adaptation they make it a big part. The problem is it feels more like a second rate space game of thrones as they focus more on the crime syndicates and power dynamics.I guess I liked the show but the original is just so much better if you haven't seen the original just watch it instead but if you've seen the original maybe give this a go.
dparker-92489,Swing and a Miss!,4/10,10 December 2021,"I had never watched the Anime version when I decided to check out the live-action show. After seeing the first episode, I went back to the original show and watched all 26 episodes. Once I was done with the original, I went back to the remake and realized why so many reviewers hate this show.I can see the effort they made to keep the spirit of the original, but they veered off too many times. They made changes that were not needed, nor improved the story in any meaningful way.They got a lot of things right, but too many things wrong and it will never please the hardcore fans of the original series.I just read that Netflix will not move on with another season/series. For the fans that have never watched the original show, now is a good time to do so."

I'm going to stop here and not watch the rest. I'm not interested anymore.

dasbobo,some old some new --- but it works for me,10/10,22 November 2021,"OK, so the actual rating is probably more like an 8/10 but people are being way too harsh with this remake so I gave it the 10/10.I loved the original; watched multiple times and thought I was going to hate this. Surprsingly, no! The live action writers know bebop and love bebop. Feel the love and don't hold on too tightly to the past.

pivan01,"Mixed feelings, but not too bad. It needs to stop though, it really does.",4/10,7 August 2022,"Let me start off by saying this show is not half as bad as some people make out of it. It is actually quite decent and if you're a fan it's definitely worth a watch.The show is taking certain liberties with characters, and that's totally fine, but I would rather it didn't. Look, I understand and support diversity and inclusiveness, but this woke wave is getting out of hand. The bullied become the bullies and dare you speak the truth you shall suffer the consequences.I wish it was purely noble, but it's not, it's ultimately about money. And if they don't stop altogether, I feel like we should stop consuming their crap.

wittyimdbid,Live Action Garbage,1/10,21 November 2021,"Other than Jet Black..... CASTING SUCKS! I like John Cho, and he attempted a decent effort for the role, but c'mon, Spike IS NOT 50+ YEARS OLD. Cho is a good actor but too old to play Spike. Plus, every time he came on the screen, all I could think about was eating a White Castle burger.Daniella Pineda shouldn't have even been allowed to read for the role of Faye. Pineda ruined the series for me and many others. (not because of her clothes or figure) because of her attitude. She simply sucks as Faye.Netflix and the writers chose to pander to certain societal groups instead of honor a true anime classic. Tried twice to make it thru the second episode, but I couldn't. I really wanted to give the series a chance, but it's just more current cultural/corporate garbage.

fourtimeronehour,I would have rather seen another Firefly season,6/10,18 January 2022,"Things how work in anime does not nessessry work in a live action too. I am a big anime fan, but the real live action versions are not very good working, even if it looks good. The series reminds me of the 20 years old Firefly, that sadly got only one season and at least a movie, to complete the story a bit. I think Firefly was what Cowboy Bebop would like to be. But it is only vilent shooting, than cool sifi.

eialdinger,Decent but doesn't preach the cowboy bebop I remember,5/10,23 November 2021,"First off the story is twisted up and yes I know you have to do that to not make it the same show but it's twisted in ways that made the sentimental value of cowboy bebop not really there in my opinion. Second off many of the characters didn't really served a purpose in the show such as Gren because his whole story of who he is, is gone. Third off they left out so many good parts to the story such as some antagonist and some events but I don't want to spoil for those who want to watch the original.It does good for its own thing but doesn't live up to the cowboy bebop name.

lopresti-46927,Netflix is best anime adaptation but that's not saying much....,6/10,24 November 2021,"When I heard they were making a live action adaptation of cowboy Bebop I was both curious and afraid at the same time. Netflix doesn't have a great history with anime adaptations but this one's not that bad.I thought John Cho does a good job of mimicking Spike. The people who played jet and Faye seemed a bit flat and dialed in. But out of the two Jett is better.The main story of vicious riding to the top and Spike reconnecting with his past is much different than the anime. I would have done it slightly differently with more flashbacks but they didn't okay job addressing the past while still dealing with the present. The story of the love triangle a vicious, Spike, and Julia and the roles they played are completely different. At first I didn't like it but then at the very end it made sense why they did the way they did.Concerning the individual bounty tales They used a lot of the same story concepts but they changed the events of those stories. In some of the stories the changes were good but in other ways it made the stories less memorable than the anime.Overall the set-pieces, cinematography, and CGI were excellent. The only thing I didn't like was that they use a lot of inserts during the fight scenes which leads me to believe that one or more of the actors and Stunt people were not doing a good job with it. But they definitely recreated the Cowboy Bebop world very well.The music was on point. It definitely fit the story and the theme of the show.It was good but it had potential to be better."
AndersSTHLM,Why,2/10,19 November 2021,First of all I liked the animation series but this was just garbage. I only gave it 2 episodes. And if you're just in it for action with no story and bad music then this is for you. A space ship built of old mixer tables and crap. Even the first Star Trek series in 1960 had better sets. It has some really great actors but it's doesn't matter the production is still just crap!
morganiwatkins,Not disappointed at all! Been a Fan and I love it!,10/10,20 November 2021,"I am typically hesitant about any remake, especially live action, I tend to be extra critical of the production value and the consistency of replicating the original storyline- which, in the case of Bebop, is flawless, IMO. But, this is enjoyable to watch and I am genuinely stoked about it!

johnryeh-49694,Not another fan hater.,7/10,21 November 2021,"I own the original series and movie DVDs. Yeah I'm old but still a fan. I enjoyed this and thought it was a solid new interpretation. The action was fun, they looked and sounded like the original characters, the comedic beats made me smirk, and I appreciated the new inventions.Is it as good as the original, I agree with the other fans. Its not.. But if you're not a fan and are new to this universe, give it a try. It's pretty fun way to binge an afternoon after raking leaves.

deaeight,Agenda driven garbage,1/10,21 November 2021,"As soon as the lead decided to disrespect the fans and hypocritically talk about the evils of the male gaze after the awful costume was criticised (even though she's ""dressed up"" looking virtually naked in other projects) this show was doomed. Nothing like the anime in tone, dreadful writing with again unrecognisable characters compared to the original. It's an insult and a disgrace. Netflix really does have money to burn! I'm this case, I'm afraid that would have been the preferred option."
mikeknight-71447,Enjoyed it very much!!!,10/10,8 December 2021,"I've never seen the anime before, so I'm not sure if the shows follow it line by line, but I can say the actors did a great job and love the fight scenes.

jgbgraham,Save your soul and watch the original series instead,1/10,20 November 2021,"This has to be one of the worst adaptations in modern history. None of the characterization is correct and the plot is a jumbled mess. They took the general plot point of the original episodes but changed all the dialog to make it cringey and it is a damn shame. There is absolutely nothing redeeming this pile of filth. I am doing a rewatch of the anime just to scrub this from my brain.0/10.

angelangelides,To balance out all the haters,10/10,20 November 2021,"This series is not worth the ratings it is getting. Most people rating have barely watched any of it and are guided by a spirit of prejudice from casting choices in comparison to the anime. I rated it 10, though I do not think it is perfect and I would have rated it an 8 if the scales weren't so biased against it. Still I recommend watching it with an open mind.I have been a long time fan of the anime and can tell you that the casting choices are actually almost all spot on. Jet and Spike are perfect for the role. Jet might not be black in the anime but he carries the character perfectly in the series. Spike is perfect down the original inspiration for the anime's character (Yusaku Matsuda, look him up). He is a bit older than he is in the anime but it is meant to be a story about oldboys that are already past their prime so it fits the story perfectly. I was only concerned about Faye, but after watching the series I think she is also great. I would definitely have preferred that they keep the femme fatale version of Faye from the anime but this is the second best we could get. They focus on the con artist part of the character and she is doing a great job at playing the cunning elusive con artist.The stories are all you would expect from an episodic series about space bounty hunters. Most episodes are basically them going after some bounties dealing with all the issues people on the edges of society have to deal with. The true magic about Cowboy Bebop is the exploration of their stories and how they got there. It's a story about cowboys past their prime and all of them have a ton of baggage to carry on their backs.All in all I feel the series has a great cast with good chemistry and anyone who likes the space western scifi trope will enjoy the series. Oh and the music score is absolutely stunning."

hondanut-73660,All style no substance wannabe noir,2/10,5 December 2021,"The title pretty much says it all. Four stars all for style - zero for content.Probably entertaining for many but too lacking any substance for this viewer. Relies solely on flash and rote noir tropes to get by with characters who are thin, generic and predictable and many of which are directly lifted (hopefully in hommage not just petty theft) from past movies and TV shows.The use of known noir gimics and characters is meant to give it a ""feel"" but it fails because it's too obvious with delivery by the cast that's also obvious and unnatural.Anyone who likes Doom Patrol might like this too.Another of the tales of the uninteresting and untalented genre (which could be good if there were any decent writers left in TV or movie production)"
jecskene,Good Fun,10/10,5 December 2021,"I never saw the anime version, nor realized one existed before doing my search for a season 2. This is a tale of a few struggling bounty hunters (known as 'Cowboys' in the series) and their efforts to come to grips with the past and present. John and Mustafa's acting really bring this sci fi action series to life. Daniella's character Faye brings a lightheartedness to their grim struggles. I was looking for science fiction that wouldn't take itself too seriously with lots of action, suspense with a helping of weirdness to keep my imagination on its toes. This delivered in spades. TY Netflix!!

tqmybbwr,Why change so much from the Anime?,2/10,21 November 2021,"If this wasn't an adaptation, it would be at least a 7. But I'm rating it as an adaptation because that's how it needs to be rated. Do not change the character development and story if you're doing an adaptation Netflix! I can't believe they sat in a room and decided on this adaptation after the failure of Death Note. Be more like Dune, which is pretty damn close to the book and it's being praised all around mostly. Why? Because they didn't mess with the character development and arch and plot. Cowboy Bebop wasn't a book so this is even easier to adapt as you have a outline already for scenes and sets and so forth. One huge thing that ruins the show is making Faye... Gay. There was sexual tension between Spike and Faye in the anime that is important. Making her Gay is just trying to get your woke points so you can feel proud of yourselves while sacrificing the quality of both characters. Netflix needs to stop ruining what already works and the writers adding their own creativity has been crud. Make something original if you feel like you have to change so much. Like wow."
Wm_Gardner,"Based on what I've seen so far, a valiant effort that falls short...",6/10,20 November 2021,"Pacing is off, that's my biggest complaint. I can overlook the plot changes and questionable effects, even the casting, though not ideal... tries to do right by the source material. The pacing is way off though, mostly too slow. Yeah, some of the changes are a bit weird, but the pacing... 😩That said, it's good for an anime adaptation. Unfortunately that's not saying much.

amalpass-65748,Good fun!!,8/10,22 November 2021,"I toyed with the idea to watch the anime first, but thought na let's go into this without any prejudice. Try and watch it on its own merits.Took me a couple episodes to warm into it, I liked the style and the way it was shot but was wondering if I liked any characters. As it progressed I started to get into the world and the characterThe fight scenes were pretty good, felt like the early episodes were paying homage to some 70s shows. They weren't slick like some of the modern films/shows but they were stylised in a fun way.The cast themselves were strong, whilst I have no reference what Spike should be like, Cho was watchable and believable, as was most the cast especially some of the peripheral characters. It didn't get too hammy but kept its lightness in a dark backdrop."
jonathanwick-44372,Bad Adaptation,1/10,21 November 2021,"People are slamming fans of the anime for trashing this show but the reality is the anime is a thousand times better than this attempt at a live action adaptation.If you're going to use the anime as the source material, at least do it right and faithfully, doesn't have to be exactly the same but starting with the cast and a script as good as the original but this, is not as good as the original which is truly a shame. I was rooting and excited about this show but they ruined it with the cast, cheap jokes, too many filler scenes and plain bad writing.The only good things are some of the music by Yoko Kanno and that is if you like Jazz which most people don't and some of the space scenes, the bebop ship and the swordfish look great.Worst part of this show is Faye Valentine, completely and utterly ruined by a cheap, childish, humorless and ridiculous performance. Ed is not far behind for the minute she's in."

I read most of the reviews on here and I don't agree with the low ratings at all, it seems a lot of people haven't actually watched all 10 episodes before reviewing it. John Cho played Spike/Fearless perfectly, and I've seen the animated series too. The casting was good! Of course the actors weren't gonna look exactly the same as the animated characters. The acting in this series is high quality. I have no complaints for this series, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.

oranmc,I'll get some hate for this one.,8/10,14 December 2021,"Pretty good show, sadly it got cancelled because it wasn't a match for the animation series which if you're 5 is alright, but forget the anime this show was soild.

bh-05570,Cho too old,6/10,30 April 2022,"John Cho is too old to play Spike. Should have been someone younger and cuter.The look and music are great tho.Love the sets and costumes. As good as the animeEp 3 so far. Fun to watch. Looking forward to seeing where this goes.

mattspina-08070,I loved the anime too,9/10,6 December 2021,"I loved the anime too... but I disagree with the hardo's roasting this live action reimagining.Nothing will ever match up perfectly, because it's not meant too... we don't want to live in a world of reproductions... I for one prefer reimagining.. it's fresh with respect to the past.So suck it up, grab a tissue and stop being a baby.. the alternative is that you never see it brought to life... or we wait another 20 years.Why not give it time to grow into something you respect? I would hope you prefer that over getting it cancelled because it hurt your feelings. Life ain't that tough folks, take the wins where you can get them.

olsenry-04499,"You can't ""cut and copy"" heart. Netflix is totally oblivious!",4/10,15 December 2021,"Spike, Jet and Faye were excellently cast. It's painfully obvious to any Bebop fan that Netflix jumped on a cash grab opportunity with this one. Everyone loves Cowboy Bebop and everyone loves John Cho! Unfortunately, Netflix didn't learn from the original Suicide Squad...... Just because you have a great trailer, doesn't mean you have a great story to tell. The trailer built me up and up! But every episode deflated me more and more. I'm just going to say it..... Vicious is a whiny, hormonal, nonthreatening waste of screen time. This was such garbage!

orca2684,Insulting,1/10,23 November 2021,They've taken one of the most beloved animes of all time and warped it to the point of insult. Major characters in the story have been downgraded and major changes have been made to villains simply to justify keeping Ein in the story. Netflix seems to think that everyone in this show should be having a great deal of sex and that Vicious should be a whiny weakling with daddy issues. Absolutely horrific adaptation that is sadly not the worst I've ever seen. The truly cringe worthy moments don't come till later in the series where it's revealed that spikes love interest Julia is actually a villain now. Ed IS in the series but with what they've done with the character it would've been better if she'd been left out. All in all it's as bad as we've feared.
DarlingLlama,Not as bad as Wheel of Time...,7/10,21 November 2021,"...it's a good thing Robert Jordan isn't around to see THAT crap.Buuuuut, it's not as good as the original anime.But really, how could it ever be?The original was the absolute standard for anime.Seems like most the people leaving reviews have never watched the anime.OTAKU UP, SON!

beaufortrockcitypope,Don't fix what is not broken,2/10,29 November 2021,"Bad casting, especially Jet Black and Gren, plus their background story was ""unfixed"" from the original anime .. for the sake of diversity and inclusivity. Gren story should have been like ""the Crying Game"" ... but instead ... just another Bar supervisor
And that season ending was cringe as hell ... SPAIG SPAIGEL ! Oofff."
AbhiSh4ke,A Good Show but a terrible adaptation,6/10,22 November 2021,I sincerely believe that live action adaptation of animes will always be underwhelming only good one I have seen is ruroni kenshin and cowboy bebop proves my point yet again. It's already nigh impossible for Japanese studios but put Netflix's out of touch production/Direction team and you truly get a bad productDon't get me wrong it's a good entertaining show but the casting is absolute travesty especially for OG anime fans. John cho is great actor and does his absolute best with spike but he is just too old to play a character molded as the carefree youth. Mustafa who i frankly expected to be the worse of the bunch is actually the best part of the show he literally embodies the annoyed old guy spirit of jet black.Now the worse parts Faye valentine's character has been absolutely destroyed and no it's not only the clothes but they have completely killed her sensual vibe and fox like demeanour. Basically everything good about her has been stripped and turned into a annoying entitled child.Vicious and Julia receive more screen time but it actually hurts the enigma of their character. Vicious in particular has almost turned into a comically deranged character. Grens character again was stripped of all mystery and turned into your usual queen trope.The liberties taken with the script introducting the same old family divorce drama in a show that needs none of it. Giving show a central plot which is exact opposite of loose plot direction that made anime a hit. In making it palatable for wide Audience Netflix zapped cowboy's soul.
tim-31315,Could not make it beyond 30 min ...,3/10,26 December 2021,"... this is how much time I give to a new show if there is nothing redeeming in it (if it is so so I may watch a whole episode - if it is totally trash, I quit after a few minutes). With that in mind, it is not trash, but I have better things to do or hope to find to watch.

filsdd,This is not a 10,10/10,23 November 2021,"Here is a primer for you:
I love the original series, I love The SeatBelts music with passion, and I've worked in animation and film for decades.Okay... 3, 2,1... Lets check:
Do you like The Fifth Element?Kill Bill??! Speed Racer???!! Baby Driver???!!!Jupiter Ascending????! Firefly??!!!!Even the original Anime? (for real!)Well, I have really good news for you: It's a really nice and fun series!The way I see and recognize what they tried to do in this adaptation was to take all the ""visual"" references from the original series (Pulp, SciFi, Westerns, Mob movies, Noir, Black exploitation, Hong Kong new wave, French New Wave...) and use this as a starting point and references.And when I say references I mean everything: From location design to acting!Reading some of the reactions and comments from fans, the impression I have is that they don't know the original references, movies like:
Dirty Harry, Desperado, Shaft, The Killer, Game of Shadows, A Fistful of Dollars... And many more.The original series was pastiche, there's no way around that. Fans are treating it too seriously.This is not a 10. But I'm putting a 10 on it because I think it deserves a way better recognition. Making stuff like this work is REALLY HARD:
I KNOW because I have done it."
samuel-granados18,"Bad direction/casting/editing/script, with good graphics/camera work",1/10,19 November 2021,"I gave it a 10 just because I know that if it gets bad ratings Netflix is less likely to put more money into a 2nd season. My real rating is really 4 stars pretty much just for the picture and graphics. The rest is god awful.The timing is way off, camera lingers and doesn't flow too well. The action scenes are a bit underwhelming. Scenes are all over the place, almost like a schizophrenic editor/director was in charge. It just doesn't feel in order or very well cut, it's very awkward most of the time.I do want to see more though, hopefully Netflix let's another director take the helm and recasts some of the actors.

cmartinport,They turn a serious anime in a live action cartoon.,3/10,20 November 2021,"I didn't expect much, and was still disappointed. I find the acting quite bad, like if the actors themselves don' t even believe what they are doing, only Spike kind of manages, and barely; the casting is even worst, the scenes and dialogues are terrible, and the action leaves little to believe, much least to appreciate. The Scifi, effects and scenography on the other hand are quite decent, the music is odd, kind like they tried to imitate the anime, but didn't get the feelings right.That's actually the idea that it gave me the show; that they wanted to make something similar to the anime, yet understood little of it, and because of that failed at every part.Which such a budget and story to grab on, the result is ridiculous.

victor-hammarback,An attempt was made,4/10,1 December 2021,"On it's own it's an ok show, but it can't be judge on it's own since it a live action remake of a classic anime. I saw cowboy bebop when it came out an it's been one of my favorite animes since then, the original has a tone of melancholy with dashes of sarcasm while the live action is slapstick with teenage angst. There were a few episodes at the later part of the season that felt a bit more true to the original. My general impression was that this was a high budget fanfiction on YouTube made by Tarantino fans who think Kill Bill is peak cinema. My tip is to watch the anime instead.

aameans,Oh the haters...,10/10,23 November 2021,"The cast was awful they say, no they weren't. It's a good multicultural cast and cast well.The music was terrible, no it wasn't. It's jazz, there was a lot of jazz in the original and don't we need some jazz in this plastic, technological music world we live in now.The story was weak, hmm, nope. The story was pretty tight to the original (which I'm catching up on now thanks to Netflix).This is a great live action rendition of an anime everyone was crazy about in the late 90's. I never had a chance to watch it back then, but everyone I knew was talking nothing and good about it.So basically what I'm saying is, the haters they're just gonna hate it, because they hate everything.Give Cowboy Bebop an open mind and you'll enjoy it. I really did.I hope we get to see a season 2 & 3 & 4, and however many Netflix green lights."
muchachostar,Overhated,7/10,15 December 2021,"No, this is not as good as the anime, not even close but its its own thing. While there are some cheesiness and predictability in some scenes, it is fun and can be enjoyed when seen as its own production. Costumes, music and acting are pretty good, worth watching.

I_AM_JADED,I think 3 stars is even too generous...,3/10,19 November 2021,"But that's what I'll go with. First of all the casting was way off. Not only do none of the characters look like their cartoon counterparts, they don't act like them either. Faye swears WAY too much for no reason, Vicious is way more anxious than he should be, and the villains of the first few episodes missed the mark by light years.I have to bring it back to Faye's character because she bugs me the most. The girl playing her didn't try to look or act like the character at all and it's probably the most annoying part. I doubt she even watch the original show if I'm just being honest.The writers also butchered the story and the dynamic of the team. The chemistry between Spike and Jet works but it's still noticeably different than the source material.I honestly tried to go into this with an open mind but Netflix ALWAYS disappoints when it comes to live action adaptations. The set pieces were pretty cool but that's about the only interesting thing about the show.Oh, and the people that gave this show 10 stars either didn't watch the original series or they are paid shills because there is no way this is a perfect show by any stretch of the imagination."
Bocanof,"A lot of work, there",8/10,29 November 2021,"It's a petty nice work.Not flawless, indeed, but still, remarkably well done, and it wasn't a easy task.It fills some plot gaps left by the original serie, and now it makes much more sense.

Cowboy Bebob is a fusion of Western Cowboy ideals, gungo bounty hunting in a space ecosystem that is rugged, stylsh, gritty and jazz. This is a rendition with modern cinematic tech and it is awesome! Do yourself a favour... Understand anime first, then cowboy bebop (OV) and then watch this. If you are not that guy/gal, stop whining...

pandaswipes,Wow!,10/10,19 November 2021,"Absolutely sensational! Cowboy Bepop has long been my favorite anime and I feel this adaptation nails the many fantastic aspects of the anime. From the soundtrack to the style and everything in between. It was cast great and I love the balance in storyline between new and old. I really couldn't ask for more and genuinely hope I get to see many more seasons with new bounties galore. I implore anyone reading this to ignore the anime purists that are never satisfied. It is compressed to 10 episodes so it does move faster than the original. Still believe the pacing was done well.

If you want to watch a classic story watch the original and stay away from this train wreck.

creole-12539,"1,2,3 Let's Jam",7/10,24 November 2021,"So far, it's an entertaining live action adaptation of the anime. The story and spirit is there. I enjoyed the anime and am enjoying this as well. The fight scenes are impressive. The visuals are equally so. Choose Bebop if it's that or fuel...

anthonyrizzo-15499,A complete and colossal disaster,1/10,22 November 2021,"What's most disappointing about it is that this should've been easy. Cowboy Bebop should be one of the easiest animes to adapt to live action because it's a love letter to Hollywood and Hong Kong cinema but instead they adapted it the completely wrong way. It's a very surface level adaptation.The main characters are completely ruined by the many changes they undergo. In this show, everything has the same name as the anime without bringing its soul, style or spirit. Both as an adaptation and as an independent Live Action product it's a bad show.

jamesrupert2014,Reasonably good live version of the popular anime,8/10,3 August 2022,"This live-action version of the revered anime finds the bounty-hunting 'cowboys', Spike Spiegel, Jet Black and Faye Valentine looking for lucrative apprehensions while Spike's past slowly catches up with him. The series is usually compared unfavorably with the anime but I liked it. The visuals are quite good and the characters, while not as developed as in the original, are interesting and engaging. The final 'twist' deviates from the original story but sets up a second season (which apparently is not happening). A significant problem with the fictional world is that technologies such as 'face switching' and hologram projections that are indistinguishable from real people are introduced but characters often behave as if they are unaware that such technologies exist (once a storyline establishes that people don't have to be who they appear to be, then both characters and viewers have no reason to believe what they are 'seeing' is 'real' and it becomes challenging to write a cohesive plot). Like the anime, the music and the odd transcultural mise en scène are great.

GavC543,"Anime lover here, I think it deserves a second season!:)",10/10,24 November 2021,"I was on the side of being critical for the first couple of episodes, but I really feel this show finds itself after that. I'd love tk see a second season covering more aspects of the original anime. I'm impressed with the approach they could for reliving aspects of the anime & I feel newcomers tk the franchise may just come into the anime with a new intrigue. 7-8/10 Keep it coming Netflix.P.s. I gave it a 10 to balance out the unnecessary hate.

dailydoseofnopes,Bebop: A Star Wars Cowboy Story,3/10,20 November 2021,"In lieu of the controversy of the show before it started the actual meat of it is that it's not really that good. John Cho. Does what he can with what he's given but when there is not much there it can't be saved.It's a complete mish mash of things old and new. Either make your own interpretation or follow it closely. Like the headline says in regards to that movie, things explored and explained that didn't need, unnecessary character changes and compressed stories for some or really stretched out for others.My main issue with this is that the original was more of a noir story while this plays like a generic action show that is more suited for network television.

sobedragon7,Exceptional,10/10,9 December 2021,"I'm sorry but, as a fan of the original series, I think they did an exceptional job turning this into something that could go multiple seasons.I do wish Radical Ed had played more of a role in this season as they are one of my favorite characters on the show.I think John Cho nailed Spike. Nailed it. The cast in general was really great.I like the action fight sequence style, the clean crisp action movements made it feel more like an adaptation of an anime as opposed to actual real life fighting, if that makes sense.Really really great, looking forward to more."
deadly_twilight,Total waste of time,1/10,19 December 2021,"This was just no..... I am afan of the anime, but after Netflix desecrated Death Note I hoped they learned their lesson. This suffered from poor casting, poor direction, and destroying beloved characters. Daniella Pineda was completely miscast as Faye, and the outfit was just hot garbage. Stephen Cho was too old to play Spike as spike was in his 20's, so miscast there as much as I love himas harold from Harold and Kumar. Jet Black's casting was good, but they screwed with the character too much. Julia was supposed to be dead, keep it that way! Vicious was a wuss in this, not the badass who showed up when he had to, which made me really angry.Overall this series is heresy to the anime ,and just how Pineda treated fans of the anime before the show aired and after it got cancelled was just horrible. Netflix needs to stop doing live action adaptations of anime. They cram them full of identity politics, change them too much, and just ruin them. So this officially gets a 1, worst adaption EVER!

The characters were unique anti-heros, villains were really nasty, some terrific less characters great ending for first season. You were left with plenty of places to go. Acting was superb. Really glad John Cho got to shine. The leads were well matched in ability, intensity and appealing.

thelifeofar,Absolute trash.,1/10,2 December 2021,"I mean, this is the cusp of mediocrity.Who wrote this for Netflix? I mean, just throwing money at something will not make it great.This show is a disaster.The writing and story telling is awful. They took the original material from the anime and turned it into absolute garbage.Specially how they changed several parts of the story. Who gave the Netflix writers permission to change the story? It's absolutely insulting to the original authors and creator of Cowboy Bebop.The last episode of the Netflix show. Absolute disasterrrr, it's incoherent and has nothing to do with the original.Who at Netflix keeps approving these awful tv shows?Then the casting. Worst casting ever.The actors for spike, fey and jet are passable at best. Not good , not bad, just okay.Then the actors for vicious and julia, awfullll choices.The best way to describe this tv show is, something like.This is like some kind of very low budget, live action film, put together in a couple of weeks, planned for a straight to video release.That's how this whole show feels.The funny thing is that, it's not low budget and they did spend 1-2 years putting this together.So what happened? I blame this monstrosity on the Netflix producers and writers."
hdelacruz,Enjoyed it,9/10,16 December 2021,"Of course the live action is going to be criticized against the classic anime but, I separated it in its own sphere and really enjoyed it. It didn't get a 10 from me because I thought Vicious was a little too emotional and animated. But other than that I thought the story line was good, the lead and supporting actors were good and it was visually entertaining. I'm actually disappointed that there won't be a second season. If Netflix gave it some time, I think there would be a cult following. I want to see more and watch the characters develope and evolve.

Those people don't strike me as the type that actually watched the Anime and the Movie.The casting of Jet was perfect.John Cho may not 100% look like Spike, but he sure does play the blase demeanor quite well.Ultimately, this is a decent adaptation that does everything in it's power to remain honest to the source material while staying interesting on its own.

Celia-N,Definetly worth trying,7/10,21 November 2021,"Let's start by mentioning I am not familiar with Cowboy Bepop at all, so this is something seen with fresh eyes, I am not expecting to be better or worse than the original, as i don't know anything about it (only that it has a great reputation). Also, this review is based on an almost finished episode 1 only.So, 1 one phrase, what would we get if Firefly, Altered Carbon (1st season), old James Bond movies, Sin City, Tarantino and Fast & Furious had a love child? Cowboy Bepop.Got hooked up on the first 5 minutes of the first episode.Spike's ""bad boy"" charm reminds me of Han from Fast & Furious franchise. Music and action scenes sooo old James Bond movies. Universe and plot, you guessed it, Firefly and Altered Carbon. Fight scene in the bar had Tarantino influences written all over it. And some Sin City perfume every now and then .Characters are cliché indeed and overall it is predictible. Still it's enjoyable.OST - gorgeous. Very good CGI.Definetly worth trying."
irish_jim,Shaking my head,10/10,10 December 2021,"Just read that NETFLIX cancelled .... This was really the best new show I watched this year.

arunimam-72064,Why mess with perfection?,1/10,22 November 2021,"So the original was like this beautifully constructed, sparingly served dish that left you with so many questions and wanting more which was never coming.A lot of us were excited about the live action to get that ""more"" which we do badly craved. There was so much to build on and deep dive in or heck even a continuation after RFB's events.But the makers of the live action egotistically rewrote the characters and script till it is unrecognisable and, frankly, revolting. Everything works but the changed characters and mangled script.It was lazy to try and piggyback on a legend, pick up its readymade iconic music, fan base and brand but then take an axe to the sublimity and beauty of the original.This should've been a space western series by any other name. It's not Cowboy Bebop by a difference of several planets and is a very very disrespectful rendition."
Vrian Sinth,Struggling to continue watching.,4/10,22 November 2021,"As I see many of these scenes reenacted, I can't help but remember how much better the anime is. The dialog feels forced and not natural. Perhaps it's just bad casting. I'm going to keep watching it and see if it gets any better, but right now its tough to slog through.

opticuscro,Oh those promotion! Stop it,2/10,13 February 2022,"The plot is very clear and rounded, in fact, an interesting story, visually well done, I do not like that theatrical approach to everything and frequent background music that is not very special. Netflix has decided to destroy the memory of another great known and popular piece. So the pattern in this series is actually the same as in all newer netflix works where they try similarly. The first couple of episodes are actually watchable, and then after about the fourth episode the aggressive promotion of human sexual orientations and habits begins. This way of promotion causes great damage to the work itself, drastically reduces its viewership, makes it uninteresting and repulsive to some, destroys a works that can potentially be extremely successful, otherwise they are destroyed in a stupid way. All hat is simply not necessary. This series has absolutely no future, you don't believe? Wait for the ratings to see for yourself!

Movie-Mate,Inconceivable,1/10,19 November 2021,"This show is garbage! And everybody (who's see it) knows it. As a general appreciator of movie and TV-shows I would point out that this series fails on every conceivable level. The acting, the writing, the directing, the action, the blocking, the staging, the sets, the costumes, the editing... everything is on an amateurish level. The dialogue and line delivery is so comically off I was shaking my head in disbelieve at times. Everything here looks staged and stale. There is no energy or momentum here, weather in the action or dramatic scenes. The (attempts) at comedy are laughable. Pun intended. The costumes and sets look unused and un-lived-in. It all looks to clean. Even the dirt looks clean here. The only good thing here is, naturally, Yoko Kanno Soundtrack. But it's wasted on this junk.Oh, and as a fan of the original Anime, this is just insulting. Aside from all the technical issues, they got everything wrong that made the original great. The characters, their interactions, characteristics, the world, the atmosphere, the humor, the drama. Where's the grittiness? Where's the sexiness, the cheekiness, the love for Noir, Westerns and Pulp? No one involved in this show has any true understanding and/or love for the original series. Hell, they don't even respect or understand their own craft.This is a style-less, class-less, sex-less and worst of it all soul-less shell of a show that does not deserve the title it was given. This is worse than (Netflix's) Death Note..."
jimilee_1971,For the fans!,8/10,27 November 2021,"This one was well worth the watch! If you are a fan of the animated series of old, you must watch!There are a few rough edges and one or two cinematic issues along the way, but the story and the cast took this one over the finish line. With its quirky relations and heartfelt friendships it has something for everyone!This is binge worthy, so get your snacks ready and be prepared!

doomsauce,Fails on almost every level,1/10,22 November 2021,"I never write reviews, but as a long time fan of the anime I felt I needed to do this. Almost everything about this production is wrong. I liked Jet for the most part, but I felt like the inclusion of his daughter was completely unnecessary. Spike and Faye were done completely wrong; John Cho is a great actor, but he is way too old to be playing Spike. Faye was a completely different character than her anime counterpart. We don't see Ed until the end of the last episode for about 30 seconds; not enough time for me to make a proper assessment of her. Also Julia is evil now, and they've set her up to be the villain next season... WTF. Did these hack writers even watch the anime? The overall feel of the show is just cheap, from the sets to the CGI. I will say the music was great, but it was just music from the anime so I can't really give the show runners any credit for that. I could probably write a whole essay on why this show misses the mark, but I'm gonna end it here. If you're a fan of the anime avoid this show like the plague."
ethanglazer,Calm down nerds,9/10,20 November 2021,"All of the negative reviews on here are from nerdy anime snobs who think any adaptations of their precious shows will automatically be a disappointment. Well, as a big fan of the original anime series, I think this show does a great job capturing the vibe and style of CB. Everything has a banged up dusty feel just like the anime. Actors are just fine. I do agree, however, that Pineda's portrayal of Faye misses the mark a bit, but still enjoyable. Just calm down, let go of the past, and grab some popcorn and enjoy.

prostrats,I loved it!!,10/10,20 November 2021,"Personally, I really enjoyed this show. And yes, I have seen the original.I went into this not expecting a perfect remake of the anime. Who actually does that??This is live action. It's not going to be the same.This is it's own version. It has its own story to tell and it's own way of telling it.If you want a copy paste of the anime then you will hate this. But if you want to see another amazing version of a great story, then you'll probably like it.Bottom line, don't compare the two. They're both good in their own ways. They are both enjoyable.

kristryg,A Really Cool and Fun Show,8/10,20 November 2021,"I've never seen the anime, but when I was younger I did love good anime. Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, Macross Plus, Record of Lodoss War, Shadowskill etcPoint is, I get it. It's hard to make a live action of a classic anime. To me, who loves film and TV, this is a win. John Cho is excellent. The cast is great. The music is awesome. There is a ton of great set pieces. Netflix did not skimp on this show.Bottom line, this is a really fun show and it's well done and I had a lot of fun watching it.If you like sci-fi and you enjoy unique shows that push the envelope, go for the laughs and have a huge budget, give this a chance with an open mind. I hate everything, and I enjoyed this lolOverall, there isn't much to dislike here and that's the plain truth.8/10 from a film and tv expert. 🔥"
doobie-19775,Casting,1/10,21 November 2021,"Poor casting ruins the show entirely. I can't even sit through an episode. Netflix chose people who look nothing like the anime characters. It seems like they never seen the anime. The person they chose for Faye was the worst. She is garbage. Jet black is also not black.

ben-snooks,Nothing like the TV show. Don't watch this.,3/10,30 November 2021,"This series is nothing like the original Tv show or film. The Faye character in the show is a totally different character than in the original series. The new one is just your typical modern PC blah character that seems to be there to meet some diversity quota or something.The style of dialog is completely different in the Netflix series. The dialog in this new series is really unrealistic. I find the characters are just talking to fill in the minutes. I seem to get bored with every episode and zone out whereas this was not an issue for me with the original TV show at all.The comedy is way better in the original. There is banter, a battle of the sexes, and inner conflict in the original show and all of it, all of it which made Cowboy Bebop so great is missing in this re-imagining. As a result the pacing of each episode just feels off and boring.I could not recommend anyone watch this, especially if they've seen the original series. This ruins the original Animated series entirely for me. I just feel this live action series is try hard but a huge disappointment."
phillafrenais,Jeez 😬,3/10,23 November 2021,"Really wanted to like this and it nearly did but. Soooooo many things wrong with this I cant be assed to go through it all. Liked it up until ep 5 then went down the pan and never came back up. This was all over the place, rushed with terrible casting, bad writing, bad fighting, bad acting, bad edition, bad lighting, bad set design and just bad all round. And the end well holy crap if things couldnt get any worse and annoying they add that to equation. Will put a more in depth review at some point but as of now this was a no no and could have been great.

gimpera,Made with love for the source material.,7/10,21 November 2021,"Let me start by saying that I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this. The fact that the original anime is so good puts this show in an awkward starting point. Pretty easy to aim at. Naturally.Long story short: The looks is right on the spot. CGI is good. Photography as well. The music is superb. Writing is not terrible. Of course, hairstyle is (and was) impossible. The cast- and showrunners - deserve their time to develop and deliver. Again. They are humans. There is a vibe - at least to me - of craftsmanship and caring for every little detail on screen. This is a good (human) take on an outstanding (anime) source material. And that's the truth. Whining about its differences is futile.

rileycarr-33645,Visual Vomit,1/10,20 November 2021,"The editing style does not really work in the medium they've chosen, it leaves the show feeling cheap and amateurish as opposed to cool and stylish. It feels a little like a Disney Channel original movie, maybe something that would've debuted on the XD subsidiary, as it comes of as desperate to prove that it is in fact cool and not, as every nerve in your body will insist, so lame as to seem almost parodic.

shireenmcfarlane,Why...?,3/10,11 December 2021,"I didn't know Cowboy Bebop was an anime when I first started watching the first episode but I got a feeling that it was about half way through.I only watched one episode because the dialogue and jokes were so awful, I couldn't watch anymore.The acting is great considering the actors where given atrocious scripts. The best parts were the costumes, the sets, visual affects and cinematograph.Thank you Netflix for not giving this show another season.

But overall I feel it's very true.My only gripe would be with the casting. Not everyone felt correct but I felt they were good enough to pass. Spike and Jet Black were great. Faye was over performed.

alfrtt,The script is terrible.,2/10,12 August 2022,"I've watch the anime growing up. When hearing cowboy bepop was being made I was excited and concern. Anime adaptations can be done if done properly this adaptation wasn't. The only complaints I had about this show was the way it was written, how it's set and it's copy and pasting from other sci fi shows. I get the idea what the writers were trying to do, not a lot of people watch anime and they would try to make sense of it for a wider audience. The original Cowboy Bepop anime was long, slow and complicated if you follow along but that's what made it unique. The way this show was written it felt like Netflix hired a bunch of college student writers to create the show, and as mention copy and paste from sci fi films. For example the episode where the the clown assassin sees his costume he was quoting a line from Bladerunner ""tears in the rain"". Honestly a fan can tell right away. The thing is about creating an anime adaptation you have to stick to the resources even if it's difficult to understand you can change the tone of it a little so everyone can understand. And not just that who thought of an idea to creating a gangster who likes eating testicles? That wasn't in the anime. But I digress, I felt this adaptation could've been better but it's writers made the show lazy and unwatchable. But the writers maybe not be to blame for it, we don't know who really was in charge or who change what. I would have love to see hbo do adaptation of Cowboy Bebop, maybe that would had been better."
gkh-975-129753,"Watch it as an original, not a remake of the anime. Then it is perfect",10/10,28 November 2021,"Reviews of this seem to tend to ""it wasn't the anime, thus it is terrible"" to ""what a thrilling, stylistic and entertaining romp"". I am of the latter. Awesome sound track, wonderfully quirky characters, cool plots, all sorts of brilliant sight gags and movie references, with a lot of laughs sprinkled in. What's not to like (if you are not an anime purist)? This is Firefly meets Dirk Bogarde all cast to a Charlie Parker background. Great stuff, and a rare series that is loved by all the family (well, would keep it away from under 12s!)

mladen982,"Cowboy Bebop, the sitcom version",6/10,26 November 2021,"If this was its own thing most people would give it an 8 but its not Cowboy Bebop. As its own thing its average but as an adaptation it fails miserably. On the surface its ok, acting is good, it looks similar, but there is a core misunderstanding from creators about source material. They are doing a Tarantino light and it should be film noir. Too much talking always going for a joke, I was expecting fake bkg laughing like in a sitcom. Action choreography is not great either. And it feels bade because I think peoples heart was in the right place, its not like they were deliberately trying to make it bad, they just don't have the chops or understanding of what they were supposed to do. If you can ignore that this is adaptation you might find some enjoyment in it.

jaredd,Calling it Cowboy Bepop was a mistake...,6/10,16 January 2022,"The original anime was what it was, too many details to go in to, but we just loved it as-is.To come along and think you need to re-hash/re-invent/re-etc. The original is just idiotic. Unless you're a cinematic god, it's just not going to work out.Since I've already seen the original, I already knew what was going to happen and was constantly comparing this live-action attempt to the original. So that pretty much ticks off most of the devoted fans I think.For everyone else, this is not really a franchise with wide appeal, so it's no surprise that it wasn't renewed for a season 2.BUT, if they would have just dropped the tie-in to Cowboy Bebop and made a new show with new IP, I think it would have worked well. Science Fiction has kind of been dying off over the years and we need good shows like this in our lives. But taking the lazy route of swiping an existing property was the mistake..."
etiggy,"Finaly, a proper adaptation",10/10,3 December 2021,"I'm a huge fan of the original anime and was a bit reluctant to watching this, due to having bad experiences of butchered adaptations of a classics, but I must say, I'm pleasantly surprised! This looks like an exact, pure and honest live action remake of the original series, and I'm loving every minute of it! If you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop, do watch this. If you have not seen it before, definitely do watch this!

She can't act she can't sing and her face is so filled with botox and fillers that you can't tell if she is happy angry or sad!

movieturtle2013,It's its own show,7/10,25 November 2021,"I love the anime! Do I like how they treated Vicious in the live-action? No, but that's the thing: It's a different show.I love the dynamic between the characters and I like the time they took to flesh them out. The attention to detail is amazing, the soundtrack just like in the anime.It is enjoyable. It does have some plot conveniences and sometimes a bit too much and unnecessary dialogue.I like the show overall. It has its moments and most changes they made for the live-action are great, except the Vicious thing. I really hate him in the remake. Perhaps that's the point.The show is for those who want to enjoy a slick, stylish sci-fi show with fun characters and story."

ythomasmore,Cute but not cool.,5/10,20 November 2021,"Looking at creators Nemac and Yost's repertoire, it's pretty clear how the new Bebop turned out the way it did. Unfortunately, they were not able to achieve the most important quality that Watanabe had that made the anime ooze coolness - noir. Every episode of the live action is redundantly formulaic in pace, tone and plot and the dialogue was all really shallow. It's colorful, silly and fast, but that's all. Also, structurally the original anime had every episode exist on its own, serving up distinct episodes that explore aspects of different genres. These are the major faults of the live action IMO.When it comes to the casting, I personally don't think Cho fits, either. His voice doesn't have the same deep coolness as Japanese voice acted Spike, which is really the only Spike. As an actor, Cho's demeanor is naturally trustworthy, sweet and optimistic. Spike should have a dark apathy coupled with his underlying compassion. I don't find that Cho naturally carries those qualities. Everyone else was pretty well fit though.Ultimately I couldn't watch the whole thing."
taniaewatkins,I wanted to like this ...,3/10,26 November 2021,"I really wanted to like this. But I can't.Its too goofy ... even for it to work as a stand alone.The characters of cowboy beebop are well known. They are well loved. They are in anime legend. And this just comes across as another disappointing american adaption.I can't talk about why this doesn't work without putting in spoilers.The opening scene to the whole series ... Spike walks in and then does a whole lot of campy movies that feels more like I'm watching 60s batman than a modern re imagining. Spike was a character who put in as little effort as possible. He hated effort. And the whole opening sequence was at odds with that.They over did Spike's interest in Julia. In the original, it was subtle. To the point that you kind of forget about her until she pops up here and there. Also Spike didn't know she was alive until the end. In this version, Julia is suddenly a main character, he's flashing back to her every other moment. Which is just too much.A lot of the time I felt like there would be 4th wall breaks and it just wasn't well executed. The casting is off too. John Cho is not Spike and Faye is now just whiny instead of whiny but a smart bad ass when she needs to be. Faye also played on her looks ALOT. She knew she was gorgeous and used it to her advantage. This Faye makes me think she wouldn't know the first thing about being sexy.I turned it off when they included a huge scene of Julia and vicious. Julia was never a big character and it feels like they are just trying to do the female empowerment thing but totally miss the point of why Cowboy Beebop was written the way it was.I didn't get to the bit where Ein showed up but I'm guessing the dog would be the best actor in the whole show."
mahoney-bellevue,Stands on its own through to a memorable finale,10/10,28 November 2021,"With winks and nods toward the source anime, I believe this venture stands on its own.I was not convinced John Cho was a fit as Spike, but I was wrong - charming. The casting altogether seemed off, and now I can't see any other actor/actress occupying those roles. I'm a believer. Julia and Vicious as true mains... loved it!If the writers would please step away from the moronic Joss Whedon-like lame one-liners - The Whedon flavor of puffed-up zingers are the clumsiest, and intellectually lazy kind of unnatural speech anyone could conceive of - then the show would be the better for it.Overall, fun to watch with unexpected depth and density. And the last two episode... nuclear momentum into another season. Fingers crossed.

jay-bartram,Kiss Of Death,9/10,13 December 2021,"I really enjoyed the series, I mean, there's not much I make time to watch these days, but this was one of those shows.I've not seen the anime, and having drifted through the Reddit sub, I'm not sure I want to be in the same room with that amount of impotent rage.That I liked this show points to why it was cancelled, or maybe it was the screaming, overly vocal anime fans that scared Netflix into canning it.Sad times, RIP another great show!

branflakes4547,Better than the original?,7/10,5 December 2021,"I thought the original anime was overboisterous and tried extremely hard to be cool. I mean it's so COOL. The main guy is super cool too. He smokes to cool music and shoots baddies. The live action was just as stylized but more simple and not as pretentious. I think the 40 minute runtime does a huge service to the flow of the episodes, because I always felt unsatisfied at the end of the 20 minute anime episodes. I'm surprised it has a 6.8/10 on this site. Although I assume it's because of the die hard fanbase of the anime, and the fact that certain fanbases are impossible to please. Give it a shot. It's a fun show.

natethegreat-07291,Come on Netflix,5/10,20 November 2021,"Predictable, campy and not enough space for this cowboy. It felt like Scott Pilgrim meets Firefly, and that is not in any way a compliment. Not to mention the terrible casting, which I'm sure is part of the reason the fight scenes were so stiff and unbelievably choreographed; the extras were better martial artists.

ShockTactic,W.T.F. ! ! !,8/10,23 November 2021,"I expected this to be horrid after seeing all the dismissive bile & disgust online!And, believe me, no one loves the original anime series & feature more than I !But, gee willikers, no adaptation of a beloved book to movie, or beloved movie to series, etc. Is going to seem adequate at first ! Initially, I looked at it as an homage, bordering on parody. And soon, I saw it as a creation unto itself. And it was damn good! Was it a casting coup? Maybe not, but the actors stepped into their roles with gusto & soon made me forget their cartoon counterparts. And the production values were more than fine ! In short, I f_cking loved it! So how about all you cool kids stop with the hate, so I can have a second season! 'Nuff said!

pinahugo,Not exactly like the anime but still stays true to the original,10/10,9 December 2021,"I know some people get upset when an adaptation isn't exact like it's source material but in this case that just wouldn't be possible. That being said, I think the characters and feel of the show stays true to what I love about the anime. Give this a try and wait at least several episodes (at least until episode 5) before judging the show. It's a fun show.

jegd-847-631407,"It's got all the style, but It's too slow paced for OG fans",5/10,21 November 2021,"It's difficult to find anything wrong with the live-action 'Cowboy Bebop', but there's something missing here that didn't translate from the animation. The casting is a little off.; John Cho is a solid actor, he fits the role of Spike Spiegel, although there's a height difference. I like his portrayal, but I've always found John Cho likeable. The casting of Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black and Daniella Pineda as Faye Valentine is a poor choice... I'm thinking of better actors who could have matched their roles with the behavior that's apparent in the animation. The acting is okay, but IMHO they don't fit well along side Spike Spiegel. I haven't quite figured it out, but I want to say, it could be that John Cho is on a different level acting-wise than Mustafa and definitely Danielle. Daniella Pineda might have been a natural fit for the character of the disruptive Radical Ed (Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV), but Ed isn't part of the crew. In fact she isn't there at all until the end, where she appears with a bounty request for the Bebop crew.The series is pretty slow for me. They've used Season One to introduce the main characters and their backstories, but by the time it's over I'm a bit bored by the introduction. The animation is a great anime filled with action, style, and substance - While the live-action version is pure style without substance. I wanted to love it, but I was bored. I was still hooked in for the long drawn out conclusion, and maybe that's what the direction was going for? Reeling in a curious audience who aren't familiar with the story. But for the fans, it was like ""Okay. Get on with the plot."" Now I see that Ed will play part of Season 2, and perhaps will receive the majority of the attention, but I'm thinking it's a little late. Do I want to wait for another year and sit through another season where it's all an introduction? Sitting here now, I think Netflix should have at least released the 2001 'Cowboy Bebop: The Movie' for anyone that's never heard of the series. This is simply too drawn out and slow for me. The series needs a gigantic push to knock it into gear and get on with the show."
angelbx-47941,"Failure, two thumbs way down",1/10,4 December 2021,"This show fails on so many levels! The original animation is on a whole other weight class. Netflix did not stay true to the storyline and made it into a soap opera. This is such a disappointment to the original show. Please do not waste your time with the Netflix version. This is a 0 out of a 10. This show is all lies and made up stories.

coles_notes,Average,5/10,7 June 2022,"A remake of the 1998 anime classic, this show has a ton of heart and was definitely created by some with immense love and care for the original. Following the Bebop, a far future space vessel and its two cowboy crew taking down outlaws for bounty throughout the solar system. The gorgeous and near perfect soundtrack of the original by Yoko Kanno is brought over almost entirely with general success, however as I feared, a lot of the aesthetic of the original didn't fully translate to live action. Constant dutch angles and insanely fast paced cuts (seriously its probably >1 cut per line of dialogue) the show can be visually disorienting at times, something that was much more subtle in the original due to its crisp drawn lines and the animation clearly sticking out from the detailed backgrounds. This also means the live action suffered from the ""dark and dingy"" cliche where the farther we go into a dystopian future the worse our lighting technology gets. This remake does bring a new cheesiness to it in its humour which I enjoyed, and I think John Cho gave a strong performance as Spike. The rest of the cast's performances I could generally take or leave, I didn't find the writing gave a lot to certain characters anyway. This remake also makes a considerably larger show of the overarching plot, something the original only touched on occasionally. I can see how they're setting up for a 10 season epic or whatever, but overall, I liked it. I will watch season 2, though it immediately gave me hard nostalgia for something I had watched literally a month ago. If you haven't seen the original and you're willing to watch it, watching this remake first is a disservice to yourself, but if you've seen the original and are looking for more, it's certainly content."
rdamian1963,Mildly entertaining,5/10,11 August 2022,"People say dont compare it to the anime, but if you have seen the anime you more or less have to. The acting in the live action is decent, but the casting just keeps the series from being better than mediocre. In addition, changing storyline is a bit more than annoying - it changes the essence of what Cowboy Beebop is in the abime series.The live action series is entertaining, but again the essence of the characters just falls short.

And here comes the remake on Netflix and what do we get? A reboot of half-a@# action mixed with poor directing and so-so casting. On top of that; really REALLY bad fighting scenes (I'm mean, Spike is a bloody Kung Fu anti-hero) so how come the fighting scenes is this bad??

dcnolan85,"Enjoyable, witty, and fun.",9/10,29 November 2021,"It's disappointing that viewers rated this version low because they compared it with their nostalgic treasure. If you compartmentalize this take of Cowboy Bepop and expect it to be something it isn't, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.I will say that I had to get past one or two episodes to really fall in love with this series but it was worth it. The aesthetics are beautiful and the CGI is quite stunning. The storytelling of space cowboys on an adventure is fun and delightful. I have also enjoyed the character development. I have watched the anime before which I did enjoy but this is also a blast.

christianf22,Hollywood don't learn the lesson.,1/10,20 November 2021,"Netflix and Hollywood in general, please stay away from anime. You have tried it several times and you failed miserably and this is not the exception. The only thing you achieve is stain the legacy of masterpieces with crappy and unnecessary live action adaptations. You don't add anything to the industry with this. Anyway, the cast is good but they can't charge the weight by themselves, the scripts are bad, the directions is bad, the rhythm of the narrative is bad. It looks like deliberately the studios choose the worst creatives and producers for anime live actions.Edit: Today officially the series was cancelled. The only good decision behind this project.

nutluck-89708,All and all I liked it,9/10,20 November 2021,"It is not perfect, far from it. It is a mix of old stories from the original series and new ones. Some of the old stories are close to the original and others completely different and some inbetween.And I am ok with that, I knew there was no way they could just redo the old series and I felt they shouldn't, some shots just wouldn't work in live action. I found the new stories or new takes on the old stories interesting enough.I have mixed feelings about Faye the main character they changed the most, her core background has not changed, in the fact she still has memory lose etc, but much of the rest of her background was changed since she woke up.Unlike a lot of others that reviewed this, I did like the actress that played her and liked the new take on her but i still kinda miss the old Faye.All and all I liked the show, I don't think it was as good as the original but I never thought it would be, the original is a classic at this point and remakes are virtually never even close to as good as the originals.This one I think is a nice nod to the originally while also trying to stand on it's own and forge it's own path ahead. I am hopeful it gets a second season, i think it is better than the vast majority of stuff that has come out in the last few years."

Radi_on_off,Good as a standalone project,6/10,25 January 2022,"In the wake of conflicting reviews about the film adaptation of Cowboy BeBop, I still decided to watch and form my own opinion.From the very first minutes, I felt indignation, the series showed long-familiar shots not the way I loved them. However, I did not stop and tried to build a wall, shielding myself from comparisons with the original. And... it helped.Camera techniques, special effects, composition of the frame - together they created harmony and a desire to look at the development of history. The work of the designers deserves special admiration, the design looked quite authentic: where they needed to be tightened up, and where not, they didn't overdo it.You can also praise the choice of actors, most did not cause dissonance.In general, this is a small space adventure that takes place and is rather worth watching (especially with beer).However, I can't really not compare.The story taken from the original was redrawn, having lost a huge share of emotions. The noir touch of the work has gone somewhere. The life of the characters and their attempts to get along on a small ship are noticeably less depicted. Although the series go 2 times longer, in 10 episodes you do not have time to fully imbue the characters. Of course, they counted on the second season, which could really help with this. But since it's closed, we won't know.Instead of a variety of genres, we got a uniform peppy action movie.In addition, the characters themselves have undergone critical changes.Faye, who had to go through a long journey of transformation from an opportunistic loner to a full-fledged team member, did it in just a couple of episodes. They also lowered her status as a femme fatale, making her a clumsy bi/lesbian.Jetta, instead of the story with his wife that he had to outgrow, for some reason they added an absolutely unnecessary child. Also turned him into a slow-witted, instead of a wise retired cop.Eddie was generally thrown out of history (except for the last seconds).But the biggest disappointment is, of course, Vicious. Blood feud with Spike, they lowered to an ordinary psychosis. Such an indistinct antagonist still needs to be looked for. Also, the actor, IMHO, was not chosen well.In addition, the adaptation failed to show the transformation of the BeBop team into a family, which is one of the key branches of the entire anime. And depriving the end of the tragedy, and generally reduces the degree of culmination.In the bottom line, if you take away everything that has migrated from the original, including the plot, Yoko Kanno's amazing compositions and visual storytelling, there will be one beautiful picture.If you do not compare with the anime, then I would put 7/10 and rather glad that I watched. In comparison, it gets no more than 5/10. That's why I give it a 6/10. And if I decide to refresh the story in my memory, the choice will definitely fall on the creation of Shinichiro Watanabe."
eviltimes,Couldn't be worse.,2/10,21 December 2021,"So. They are just reshooting the original episodes - in twice the time - 25 vs 45 min! Then fill the extra space with nudity and profanity. ""Fight"" scenes are in decrepit slo mo to further kill time. The space battles and frankly all the space scenes are gone - no budget? Where is the. Swordfish II ?Worse - these characters are actually hostile towards each other. While their relationships in the anime are rather crude, they are still genuinely affectionate towards each other - not nasty childish Americans from the early 21st Century.Good parts include beautiful sets and cutesy camera angles (that work).Yoko Kanno music - but in the wrong places for anime fans who are used to the musical cues.Avoid this if you ever loved the anime."
rockstrongo-99233,Started good... but the newly added elements are killing it,5/10,23 November 2021,"I am a fan of the original Cowboy Bebop anime series. I approached this new series with an open mind. And after the first episodes of this adaptation, I still thought: Not perfect, but not bad at all.But then - from episode 7 / 8 on - it went rapidly downhill. Oh boy, and don't ask me how. Without wanting to spoil anything - the last two episodes in particular are so stupid that you seriously wonder whether the writers still think their audience is sane. The last two episodes were almost unbearable.If you look at the current ratings of the individual episodes, it's obviously not just me... The series gets worse from episode to episode. Only the first episodes save the rating of season one for me at a 5.The series is good where it uses the anime series as a template. And as long as the core business - the bounty hunt - is still the subject. Everything that has been newly added is completely inconsistent and makes little sense. Especially the whole subplot with Vicious and Julia is completely stupid. Vicious is a total caricature of a villain. The acting is just ridiculous. Don't even get me started on Julia ... especially in the last episode.All in all, a fantastic story was destroyed by the newly added elements. I have very little desire for season two."
mdfisher-50742,Love it so far - 4 episodes in,9/10,23 November 2021,"I'm not an anime fan but I do own the entire Bebop series and the movie and I think this live action series captures the heart of the animated series. It is one of the best things I've watched this year. Don't let the fanatics steer you away. It is worth the watch.I like the casting, the special effects, and the music of course.

Thatfilmguy95,Fantastic interpretation.,10/10,20 November 2021,"I have to first off start by saying I grew up on the anime I also work as a professional filmmaker who is also made my own adaptions from big franchises. As my main experience as a filmmaker is working as a Director. I truly do not understand the heat for the show, obviously when you're turning something at a live action there's going to have to be some adjustments to physically make the project work.I think the show perfectly balanced the emotional tone with the comedic elements from the anime series. The filmmakers and Director were clearly fans of the Original series. My biggest fear mainly knowing the lead actor from Harold and Kumar was I was truly afraid he wouldn't playoff the role properly. But his energy in timing was practically perfect bringing an anime to life. Honestly I just hope Netflix sees this and I get the opportunity to direct for season two. I sat down and binge watch the whole series in one sitting. I would legitimately read it at 10 but I don't believe any project is technically perfect. I think the anime fans whining and complaining need to grow up and understand that when you turn something in the live action there's gonna be some give-and-take."
scottritchiemeyers,"Great Cast, Great Take",9/10,24 November 2021,"Cowboy Bebop was one of the first anime series I saw. It combined the frenetic energy of jazz with the frenetic lives of bounty hunters in a universe where Earth is inhabitable and mankind was forced to the stars. It is a classic.This version does it justice. It also takes the original and adds to it. The chemistry of the cast is remarkable.If you haven't watched the original this version still makes sense.Give this one a shot. It's worth it.See you space cowboy.

fibulator777,Cancelled for good reason,3/10,11 December 2021,"They went the woke ""ultra inclusive"" route to the detriment of the characters being played.Casting is *gut wrenchingly* bad. Only one that fits is Jet. Race doesn't matter, as long as they still fit. But most of the actors simply didn't fit their characters. Wokeness is gonna start hitting these production companies in the pockets, and they'll being to understand they are pandering to an extreme minority while alienating the majority.And the stories are exactly the same... but worse.When you do a reboot of series you either:
A: Have to do much better
B: Pick up where the older series left of
C: Both.This is neither. Not worth the watch, even in the slightest. Skip it and watch the Anime over again."
austinthep,Passable,7/10,29 November 2021,"Don't go into this looking for the same exact thing. You kind of have to be more open minded for this project. It's not the greatest live action adaption, but it's also not the worst. I at least enjoyed watching most of it and wanted to see how they could change things without completely destroying the show.I will say that there is cringe in this show, especially the final scene...Not the actor's fault, but it happened. Just be prepared for that. I want to see where this production goes.

subhamdassneha,"I thought maybe finally they will get it right, but nah...",3/10,19 November 2021,"I have only seen 2 episodes, and so far it's been disappointing.The sets are mostly great looking but somehow still something feels off...in the original anime, the world felt real, it really felt lived in, but here, despite looking great , it feels like a set and not a real world.The acting is off in a lot of places...I mean certain dialogue/jokes work better in animated format than live action.And all the scenes that were taken directly from the anime are just inferior versions of the scene
And you know it's bad if the fight scenes in a 23 year old anime is much superior and realistic to that of this live action version.And the opening sequence was a big red flag for me ...not only was it bad ...but it also shows spike as a idiot who got the casino destroyed which is completely opposite to the anime movie where spike is shown to be very good at his job."

lelliott7,Poorly done,5/10,23 November 2021,"The show is rushed.Some casting is terrible, notably Faye(daniella Pineda)...wow just so bad.Costume design, hair and makeup, are pretty atrocious. At times it feels like a cosplay.John cho and mustaffa do a good job in their roles.It's a shame, the show had potential. Bad storytelling. Overall the acting is good, except for the main characters not named spike & jet. Again Faye is terribly cast and just not good. Haven't made it to Ed yet, but I hear the show only gets worse...too bad because the cgi and set are good.

Malarky007,Unnecessary Bad Reviews,10/10,22 November 2021,"This is getting unnecessary harsh reviews (and probably from people who've barely passed puberty).Look guys, I'm sorry all your favourite A-List celebrities didn't cast for the roles. But I'm sure they did the best with what they had.And as for the ""they can't recreate anime"", you're out of your mind.I watched Bebop when it can out and I was blown away with the special effects on this show.I couldn't help but think that the sets and effects were (literally) out of this world.You have to be a very spoiled individual if you aren't taken aback by what they can now do visually with sets. It shows they can create anything the mind can image. It's amazing how far we've come.You could actually imagine the ports and other worlds. Something that in 1998 was impossible to capture and conceive the mind. It was, after all, just anime. This is visually stunning and you can really picture what Elon Musk has in mind for Mars... More McDonald's adverts and dive bars.Which is probably truer to human nature than some utopian holiday destination.Regardless, as I said, this is getting unnecessary harsh reviews.It deserves at least a 7.2 and plus. It has its faults, but the story line is good and true. The acting is good, the visuals are fantastic and it all comes together to leave the viewer wanting more.All the nay-sayers should just carry on reading comics and appreciate that this is introducing a new medium to something they love.Rather than jeopardising another series by beating on it with crap like ""Benedict Cumberbach would have been a better Vicious"" ""There is nothing good about this"" blah, blah, blah.I'm giving a 10 to raise its score, but admittedly I think it's about a 7.5."

And I see differences between anime and series, and it's ok, it can't be exactly the same. Totally disagree about miscast, all actors really good, E1N one love. Ed looks a little bit weird, strange chose of wide lenses for frames with Ed. Arc with Jets daughter looks poor. But series isn't so bad how a lot of reviewers say. Give him a chance."

The actors have great chemistry together, and the story is entertaining and captivating.Unlike other anime to live action remakes, this one was beautifully done, and this series could get 10 stars just for Spike's abs.One thing I don't like is vicious' hair.

The director nailed it, adding Jazz throughout the series' musical ambience."
javiergarcon,Anyone that gives this less than a 9,10/10,31 January 2022,"To be honest someone hired those people to review a less than perfect 9! Either that or they are the worst reviewers on the planet. None of these people have ever tried to act or been on a movie set and how hard and expensive it is so they really need a reality check. So lets say they actors are phenomenal! The camera scenes and how the camera moves in the scenes is absolutely amazing and there are scenes that are heart breaking but remember this is a comedy not a romance. Your not supposed to cry in a comic book. I REPEAT YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO CRY WHEN YOU READ A COMIC BOOK. DUH!!!! So stop giving it a 3 star and get real people this is not supposed to be real life or mimic your real life this is pure fantasy for your enjoyment. Some critics cant tell the difference between fantasy and reality.

degokasari,Calls to Jupiter are not that expensive.,8/10,7 December 2021,"I'm an expert at this! However calls to Mars on that day are credit. How dare you accuse a child. Accurately portraited. Just leading at chess is totally where the ""husk leads"" the gravel. It's a relative master quote. And it literally is about the animal of the rook game. I hope the cast doesn't loose the fame. It's funny. Honestly. People get tired of Spike reaction on any platform. And the entire story didn't not fit into the artist schedule. So I don't really mind getting a stranded loop in the story. It's kind of starting to fade into rock n roll western. If any movie goers know what that means?

halreid,Its so so good,10/10,21 November 2021,"I don't know what these idiots are doing rating this 3 stars. This is a fantastic remake. They hit all the high notes that you want to see story wise, then flesh those out to really add to the lore as a whole. Nothing feels randomly added, it's all just very bebop. It's a funky groovy awesome ride. John Cho isn't the exact anime Spike, but he's a great version of him. Mustafa Shakir is 100% jet black. Everything he says, the way he moves, the looks he gives Spike, it's 100% jet black from the anime. Like the same way they cast JK Simmons as J Joana Jameson in Spiderman, the dude is perfect. It's more grounded than the Speed Racer movie, but still very clearly anime based, which i love. They do shots and music in ways you just wouldn't do in other TV, cause they're like, **** it, this is happening, everyone just enjoy this jazzy groove. I need everyone to start rating this higher, cause I need season 2.

sierravistarn,Please Make More!!!!!,9/10,15 December 2021,"Yes that's five exclamation points!I generally rank TV shows or even movies by how often I would rewatch them, and this show I have already rewatched twice. I see a lot of people complain about this show and feel this is attributed to the anime die hard fans. The show was a lot of fun and the Dynamics between the characters was really well developed. I was really excited to see the second season and was completely bummed when I heard it was canceled by Netflix. Netflix please bring this back as it was a really great show.

Kutalpm,GTA definitiv edition without the bugs,6/10,20 November 2021,"It's not a sci-fi tv show. It's more like Knight Rider.It's old; writing style, tempo, choreography everything is old. It's like playing an old video game.First episode is really bad. I didn't like the orange color. It's suffocating.The problem with adaptation from anime is, getting the characters right. They've to look the same and give the same vibe. Otherwise they look like imposters.Also anime simplifies everything; the characters and the set and relies on your imagination. However if you simplify the set in a movie, then it looks like a cheap movie. You're fighting against the imagination of the people. You can't simplify.Only Faye was over average and interesting. Others are boring."
iksdrien,A really nice try to adapt the best Anime art work in live action.,8/10,22 November 2021,The Anime is by far the best Animes on TV since 1998. Never seen somthing comparable. That makes it difficult to adapt it. The original is a masterpiece with mixed genres and a lot of love for details. I think Netfilx did their best to adapt.but at least they changed essential parts and forgot some lovely details. The picutre and Musik mix was not balanced. It seems like they try to put jazz music in as many scenes as possible. Less is more if its placed perfectly. But nice that Cowboy bobop is not forgotten.

spoonman-33022,Unnecessary Live-Action Remake,3/10,19 November 2021,"First, I want to point out that everyone involved with this did an amazing job. It looks great, the actors were convincing, the CGI was amazing. The main issue here is was this really necessary to make?I couldn't even finish the first episode, because all it is is a live-action remake of an awesome animated episode that already exists and that I'd really rather watch. You could chalk it up to my personal opinion, but what the original series conveyed through the medium of animation this live-action version just can't quite grasp. For example: the fight scenes. Though well-choreographed, just wasn't as fast and energetic as the animated version.I was a bit excited for this series, and would have been more on board if what I viewed wasn't a slight variation on an episode's storyline that already exists. If they put the characters into different situations and adventures then I would have been more interested.Sad to say: all of this effort, time, and money and all I really want to do now is stream the original."
michalsmetana,I am bored,2/10,11 December 2021,"Honestly? It's just not working for me. I am not much into anime, but I've enjoyed the original Cowboy Bebop. But in this case... I am simply bored. It's not cast or their performances. All is fine there. But overall pace of episodes feels so slow that I could use it instead of sleaping pills. I can't even finish the third episode.Sorry Cowboy, but this bounty is a bust.

aerozot,Keep it coming,7/10,25 November 2021,"I love the anime and i like the remake. I don't think it's fair to compare it to the original. Nothing is going to live up to one of the best anime of all time. So i think they did the right choice and kind of went their way. It's more of an inspired by, rather than a hard remake. Which is fine. We're getting more of cowboy bebop and that's a good thing.

kevinibbotson,An excellent adaptation,10/10,22 November 2021,"Great casting, all 3 main actors are perfect despite the age differences with the original characters. It's shot beautifully, excellently produced and makes all the right changes to the anime source material to adapt it perfectly to live action.To avoid spoilers, they change the ending significantly but that's required to allow them to move forward and tell original stories rather than retelling episodes of the anime.All in all it's a wonderful adaption. I wasn't expecting much from this, but it absolutely deserves your attention whether you liked the anime or not.

viggenpower,Nothing revolutionary.,6/10,4 December 2021,"Let's be real... Fans of Bebop wanted NEW episodes. After TWENTY YEARS, fans deserved it. Instead, we got what essentially came down to a ""Lucas edit"" of the original. The visuals were good and the casting of Jet was 100% on point, but the script was a lazy rewrite of the original Anime. Same villians, same plots, same settings. Fans deserve better.

just_me_dev,Very bad reproduction,3/10,26 November 2021,"First of all the cast doesn't fit the original anime characters and for a very huge fan of the anime like me this will be the first thing that will make the movie feel off by a mile. I hate how they changed the story. In the original anime Valentine comes in much much later not in the first episode like it is here and I don't remember Jet Black having a small girl. He was in a relationship with Alisa but he was abandoned by her later on and they never did have a child. Vicious finds out much later that Spike is still alive. And I can keep on going with how much they have compared to the original anime. I know it's not produced by the japanese but when you try to make something after a manga or anime, then try to keep it as much as possible to the original one, don't rewrite it how you like it. I personally consider this show an offense to the original anime, a circus and nothing more. A circus typical for Netflix productions."
gregorycookjohnson,Don't understand all the negative reviews,8/10,22 November 2021,"Is it perfect? No.Is is consummately entertaining, with solid humour and banter? Yes.Really enjoying this series, though I confess that I am ignorant of its anime roots.

sraniinik,Meh.,5/10,26 November 2021,"It's ""loosely based on cowboy bebop"" not ""the cowboy bebop"". My position is not ""I don't like changes"", my position is ""I don't like when a good original piece is being turned into something mediocre"". Visuals are good/ok. Except for camera work(or is it bad choreography?) that feels laggy in combat scenes somehow.Everything was reworked: characters, story, tone. It went from ""blues western"" to ""pop sitcom"". I can't quite put a finger on it, but the whole thing except for CGI feels cheap like a college art project or something.The thing is pretty mediocre overall; tries to appeal wider audiences by making characters more relatable. Writers turned a bunch of outcasts running from their pasts & earning money the only way they know into some bro-cowboys who think killing is a fun pastime. A story of small people in the big world is turned into some cliched criminal dramedy.The original was ""not perfect, but good"", this one is just two steps down."
CaptainGimpy,One of the best anime adaptations I've seen,9/10,22 November 2021,"So, I finished it the same day I started it lol. For those of you that don't know, Netflix original series ""Cowboy Bebop"" is based on the 1998 anime of the same name. That tells a former assassin turned bounty hunter. It's cyberpunk with a healthy heaping of comedy, that helps give it the longevity to get it to this point. John Cho is probably one of my favorite parts of the Netflix adaptation. I thought the look and feel of the series was slick and embodied the Cowboy Bebop aesthetic to a T. I was actually happy to see it do it some thing with the characters in the world while still staying true to the essence of what Cowboy Bebop is. I know that there are people out there who have a whole lot of nostalgia for the franchise, I've seen it more than once but it's been 15 years since I last watched it, so I went in with absolutely zero expectations and found myself really enjoying my time with the series. Mustafa Shakir has Jet Black, The principal but jaded former detective, and the changes to his personality were welcome one to me. As I didn't really connect with the character in the anime whatsoever. Daniella Pineda play the more lively version of Faye Valentine then I was used to, and I know that rubs some fans the wrong way, but I liked it. The only thing that I tend to agree with other people on is that vicious was miscast... The character is supposed to be menacing and intimidating, I found this iteration of the character to be kind of laughable when he explodes... If it weren't for all the blood and carnage I wouldn't know that I was supposed to be afraid of him. Oh and although, I think this has been one of the best live action adaptations from anime that we've gotten... Certainly much better than what we've gotten from Japan for the most part. I am definitely looking forward to a season 2! I'm really glad the show is it's own thing and not a lifeless, condensed copy in the same vein as something like the Fullmetal Alchemist film."
Deadpool_420,"Ignore the fanboi haters, this is an enjoyable series",8/10,22 November 2021,"It's really sad seeing so many self-professed fans, most of whom were still watching Teletubbies when the original anime ran in the US, review bombing this live-action remake because they've come to discover that real human women don't have size 0 waists and size FFF busts or can't style their hair to stick out at 90 degree angles. Get over yourselves, crybabies - if those are the things you wanted from this series then you were never really a fan at all.Honestly the show does a good job trying to recreate what is, for me, the greatest animated series of all time. In particular, the heart and soul of this series is the MUSIC and getting Yoko Kanno to return to provide the score is just perfect.The one downside for me is the dialogue. Occasionally delivering their lines the actors come across really cheesy, the first scene of the first episode is a prime example and probably why the more mainstream reviewers are down on this show. But this was the same with the anime, it's just that live-action always makes those things stand out more since voice actors are experts at delivering hokey lines with complete sobriety."
shawnb389,Faithful to the original,9/10,24 November 2021,"If you wanted to make a compelling live-action version true to the original and also updated for today's audience, I'm not sure you could do better. Up-aging the cast and adding a bit of diversity (frankly, fixing two problems of the original) only strengthens the tone,core, and character of the original.

lreber-95401,Give it a shot-it's worth it!,10/10,5 December 2021,"Cowboy Bebop was the very first anime I watched. If there's one thing you can learn about manga-anime is that almost always, the anime changes things from the manga. It's going to happen. That's not always a bad thing. Such is the case with Cowboy Bebop. Things changed, but I absolutely loved this adaptation of it.Faye was a little different, but I loved her. She was hilarious. All the actors were perfect for the roles. The fight scenes were great. The ending was different than the anime, but considering who died in the end of the anime, I was perfectly fine with that change!My only hope is that they will ignore all the bad ratings and make another season, because it definitely deserves a second season.

aZiXx,Much Better Than the Anime Movie,10/10,21 November 2021,"People who hate this seem to be stuck in an anchoring effect bias where the first iteration of Cowboy Bebop is what they are attached to as the definition of what the story/characters ""should"" be. When this series doesn't match the previous iteration, they immediately dislike it for failing to be the same.I remember trying to watch this acclaimed anime series years ago, and didn't get past episode one. It seemed boring. But that was a different time. I went to watch the movie now after catching 7 episodes of the new series, and I can say that the characters are better in the live-action. I prefer Jet's character here compared to the movie where he is portrayed as more stupid it seems.Everything is just better, from the acting, to visuals, to story. I would say about 8/10, but I voted 10/10 to offset the child-like reactions of those who aren't evaluating this series for itself and are too stuck trying to compare it to the self-imposed criteria that the only way this series would be as good as the anime they first saw is if it was exactly the same (or at least that's the impression I get when reading their reviews).I do like the conspiracy angle of the movie though. That's appealing to me. That makes for good stories anywhere ;)"
MetalRufo,"It's ok if you don't compare, but not above a 7",6/10,16 July 2022,"Objectively, it's quite ok, I enjoyed it, but if you're re-making a really popular anime you cannot do just 'ok', what do you expect when there's already a hardcore fanbase of the anime waiting for the series to compare every detail? Like I said, it's ok, but sadly, not good enough, and with some complete misses, like Faye casting... just wrong.

ianwagnerwatches,Bad,4/10,1 February 2022,"I wonder if this show's release in late November, 2021 contributed to the death of Keiko Nobumoto, creator of the original series, on December 1st, 2021. I wonder, but I truly hope that he didn't know about this show before his death. As a parent should never experience the death of their child, a creator shouldn't have to see their work ruined before they expire.

casparvintschgau,:/,1/10,23 November 2021,"I was very much looking forward to watching this live action version of the original show ""Cowboy Bebop"" and so far i have seen 2 episodes. I cant decide whether i should watch the rest of them to see if it gets any better, but so far it has been a horrifing experience to watch, as seeing how they managed to for one thing get the absolute most unfitting cast for this and on the other hand randomly mix different aspects of the original.If you like the original just rewatch that, but don't watch this abomination.

MovieBuffMarine,Wasn't too bad,6/10,12 June 2023,"Animated to live action work is a big challenge because you already have in your mind what the material is ""supposed"" to be. Sometimes, the adaptation of the source material goes overboard and then you have angry fans and cruel critics.I thought this live action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop was okay. The three main players did alright with what they were given. They had a good chemistry going.The dark themes and action from the animated series were done well; not great mind you, but enough to come back for more.The villains in my opinion didn't really live up to the source material. There was something lacking in them.One villain who was my favorite who was featured in Session 20 of the original made his way into this adaptation; he didn't seem as diabolical as his animated counterpart. And in the original, while this said villain got his own episode his own plot in a stand alone story, for the live action version, he recruited by the main villain to wreak his havoc with our protagonists. That didn't work too well in my opinion.But other than those gripes, the creators of the live action version did get the bounty hunter aspect of Cowboy Bebop right and Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts were tapped to return to do the music for this one as they did for the original, a big plus.It is a hard sell to adapt any animated hit into a live action fare, and Cowboy Bebop was no exception. So called hard core fans didn't really like it.But despite some of my criticisms, I didn't think it sucked too bad. While not perfect, they got a couple of things right.It's a shame there won't be more seasons coming out. Ed who was prominently featured in sixteen Sessions of the original debuted briefly on the final episode and it appeared will begin future episodes. But to no avail.This iteration of Cowboy Bebop was not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it had potential and should have been given another season or so.Check it out and see what you think."
mranna-32670,Thoroughly enjoyed it,10/10,11 December 2021,"Thoroughly enjoyed it and I liked their new take on it. Beautiful aesthetic and beautifully shot. I am just sad they have cancelled season 2 because I really wanted to see how the story would develop especially after how season 1 ended. There's just so much more to explore!

cavalcanteadamo,A bad parody,4/10,19 November 2021,"3 for the soundtrack, 1 for Ein... The rest of the series is a bad parody, bad acting, bad characterization and a laughably deplorable script. You will be disappointed even if your expectations are minimal.

giangdang00,Different kind of entertainment from anime.,8/10,28 November 2021,"Im a huge fan of the series. Yes anime lovers will be judgemental towards live action.After watching the whole live series, i learn to pretend i know nothing and it was still very enjoyable. The only thing they could really work on is the action/fight scene choreography to be more intense and faster. I notice alot of the scenes were so slow vs SHANG CHI and IP MAN. I know they could definitely step it up.Overall i really enjoyed the series and i hope they go for another season, this was very good in my opinion.Dont listen to the haters, they all just bandwagons because anime isnt meant for everyone.

philipjfry-72092,Misses the mark,3/10,30 November 2021,"Despite the impressive amount of effort at making the show look good it fails to capture the spirit of the original.Cho clearly does not quite understand Spike, his coyness and intermittent tenacity are nowhere to be seen, not to mention his clunky movements that would not lead me to believe he were a disciple of jeet kun do if it weren't for the wood dummy they took the liberty of adding in the first episode. As for Shakir, he is sorely lacking the warmth and charm of Jet's soul.Keep in mind, these aren't forgiveable mistakes - this absolutely ruins any chance this show had at embodying the feeling of the original - but toss in the bewildering choices to change the story and we've got a complete failure on our hands.I wasn't expecting a shot for shot remake, but the story needed absolutely nothing and the changes dont just detract, they ruin. If Fey didn't have a bounty on her head, why did Spike detain her? No explanation. Best scene of the first episode, when Katrina kills Asimov, why change that?? Why just throw Fey into the first episode and make her a martial artist (not to mention the moment they chose to just toss her in ruined they scene where Asimov chokes out Spike, showing his vulnerability early on which was important). Choices like these were disastrous and exemplify the mishandling of the original masterpiece, coupled with bad casting of Jet and Spike and its a big no thanks for me.Few stars for better than expected cinematography and Daniella Pineda for getting closer to her character then her costars (although still misses the mark).Sigh. I wanted to like it, but never asked for it and won't be finishing."
xnuinside,I hope Netflix will give a chance to this show,10/10,21 November 2021,"Most problem in the first season that scenarists & actors tried to copy 1 -to-1 anime. But why you need to do this? No one expect that adaptation in series will be same as a book or game, why you want to do this with anime?I hope Netflix will continue this show & give scenarists a chance to expand Bebop universe with new episodes, stories and personas. Anime has only one season - give fans that they want - continuation, not re-use that exists.

golden_fighter_009,just like the anime,6/10,19 November 2021,"Netflix is going for something they got the right energy and vibe from anime
its boring like anime. Anime has its moments so does the series what anime lacked was backstories this live action is gonna give us that what this action lacks is expensive look of dystopian, apocalyptic, cyberpunk vibe i believe thats due to budget but they are on the right path
create more grounded story and they might achieve what has never been achieved Good adaptation of anime.

TheRandomJ,"Hey, at least it made me wanna watch the original anime series again..",2/10,19 November 2021,"Another year, another unneeded Netflix adaptation.Even if we take the source material that it is based on out of the picture, we are left with mediocre attempt at space western, that falls flat thanks to laughable writing, bad acting, bad cinematography... most likely the only good thing was Ein. He was extremely well casted and he played his role really good.And now when we take into consideration the original anime series, it gets ever worse.Episode with Abdul Hakim was especially bad. Episode with the bomber - ruined, since it is rewritten... In a truly bad and lame way.Overall I recommend newcomers to drop the series and watch the anime + movie so they can enjoy a better paced story, better dialogue, better everything.This here is by the book Netflix show down to every detail including western woke propaganda.The only good thing the didn't ruin is the music. Thank God for Yoko Kanno.This and the fact the series made me rewatch the original. Damn Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop is so good.PS: Watanabe - san, you were right. Thanks for the warning."

vic-56352,See You Soon Cowboy Bebop!,9/10,15 December 2021,"I'm glad I waited for the final episode of Cowboy Bebop before rating the show. While the first episode was remarkable in how the set pieces and story were directed lifted from the anime series, the show as a whole got off to a slow start. Both the writing and acting struck me as forced. Luckily, as the series progressed both improved. And the final episode cemented the live action reboot as singular genre bending success.No doubt the style of the show is divisive. Viewers will either love it or hate it - accounting for the middling popular rating. That said, yes please; let's have another season! I have a feeling this show will soon become a new cult sci-fi classic in the footsteps of ""Firefly"".

Crimsus,Netflix places a stain on another great anime title!,2/10,21 November 2021,"There is a saying, ""If it isn't broke, don't fix it."" Perhaps we need another one that goes, ""If the original was awesome, don't try to remake/reboot it!""I have been a long time fan of the original anime since it debuted in 1998. I was cautiously optimistic about this live action attempt. While this new series has its moments (only a few), the sum of its parts left nothing but a disappointing hole in my hopes.Once again, Hollywood decides to take successful dialogue and plots, rewrites them, and delivers a lukewarm plate of garbage that smells of bitter almonds. The casting choices resemble some poorly crowd-funded cosplayers. There is nothing wrong with the actors themselves, but they just aren't the right cast! It's like someone read a blog post about the original anime that is a terrible summary from Wikipedia, held a lottery for the casting choices, and then used a Google AI to write the dialogue based on internet comments for the original anime. Yes, it is that bad.If you are a fan of the anime, but you have never flogged yourself before, watch this. You'll regret the choice."
alekseivashchenko,Almost Great.,7/10,20 November 2021,"The first episode had a many things going for it, especially the pacing and the story. I haven't seen the anime since I was a kid but I found myself recalling key shots from this first episode in my memories of the show. Even if this is your first introduction to the CB world, you can appreciate the amount of detail put into the visuals, character development and pacing.Some things that went over my head as a kid: SPOLIERS
Spike's journey to recovery mimics real life. In other words, even though this is set in a ""future"", we're still living in a world where we must busy ourselves in creative ways to afford some grub.Jet's journey is most likely a commentary on how our ""need"" to work is providing us a purpose while simultaneously alienating us from the ones we care for the most, so we buy them gifts as a poor substitution. Remember how the episode begins with a critique of the system by a madman?Ms. Valentine's introduction was a bit annoying but necessary to justify her being in future episodes. I'm personally cringed at the amount of unnecessary cursing, but whatever, we can't always get what we want; the theme of this whole show."
AscalonRift,"Summarized by the word ""Yikes""",1/10,23 November 2021,"Netflix has an overt tendency to take source material to an otherwise cringy level and this title is another example of it. My biggest concern is how ""moody"" they painted most of the characters until re-introducing Ed... Who for some reason is the only unchanged character which seems straight out of the original. Its a vexing combination to see.It didn't quite catch its stride through the presented exposition and to give credit when the source material exists on the same platform is insulting to say the least. It didn't know what it wanted to be.I think the series got stuck in its own ""Bold re-imagining"" tagline and ignored aspects of the original that made it so great. Its use of music, color pallets and background elements. The anime always felt classy, it always had a weird combination of disbelief and reality which it didn't really need to explain.The Netflix adaptation felt like watching the Total Recall 2012 vs the original in that sense. It lacked the charm and directing in its writing opting to flesh out characters that would otherwise remain distanced.I really wanted to like it, but I could not digest either the changes or the direction that the director chose for the series.TLDR; go watch the original."
Aednos,Watch the 1998 anime and avoid this thing,1/10,3 January 2023,"This it's just an insult to the 1998 anime this souless' live action series, it fails in all areas. It looks like the production doesn't understand japanese animation or Cowboy Bebop anime. There are tons of new very poor screenplay that added stupid things. And on top, in a space story you berely see space in the10 episodes. There's no thrill, the characters are extremely changed, they loosely based this series on the anime. For moments it looks like a bad soap opera; they worst comes in episodes 7 to 10 where they desided to invent like 90% of the script and is painfull to watch, if you tried to smash your head to the screen I sympathize with you. I'll do what Jet, Spike or Faye would do and go and have a drink to forget this nightmare."
mlballerini,"If you have not seen the original, you MIGHT like it. If you have, you're going to just get angry./",2/10,2 December 2021,"I don't even know where to start. I feel like whoever made this show had never seen the original. Some characters personalities have changed and it is always for the worst. The tone of the show has changed to try to be more comedic(which it fails miserably at). It really has no redeeming qualities. As I mentioned if you have nothing to be disappointed about I guess it might be considered an alright show? It's hard for me to say since I have seen it, so all I see when I watch this is just a steaming turd.

tenjin-81214,A Unique Take On The Original,7/10,9 December 2021,"Say what you will about Netflix's take on Cowboy Bebop, I enjoyed a good 70% of it and felt my time wasn't wasted. I am a Cowboy Bebop fan (the original animation) and I obviously will have some gripes with it. However, when looking at this first season objectively, and not through the lenses of a die hard anime fan, this was pretty good.I was first skeptical of John Cho (great actor but I didn't see him in the role) being Spike, but then as I was watching he became apparent that he was a good choice. He carried most of the vibes that the original character had. Mustafa Shakir as Jet is the best choice they have made cast wise. He doesn't quite look like Jet but he feels like him. Daniella Pineda as Faye didn't feel like Faye. I don't think they wanted her to be. But she works quite well as another character.Vicious is over the top. I think Alex Hassel is a ok actor but he has been done wrong with the script. He is more cartoon than the actual cartoon and that is not a good sign. He lost all competency and the fear factor that the original had. In this series he is just some idiot that happened to have power because his daddy was the top dog. Not a fan.Julia's update made her more interesting but the reveal was too obvious. I liked her update to a certain extent. It just didn't execute properly.Overall, this title gets many things right. It answers some things about what the original didn't explain at all. It covers some plot holes from its source material but it does open up some new ones. Luckily it doesn't not distract the entertainment. Also, plot updates are questionable but it is good enough for the audience to accept. Especially when you know they plan to make another season.For veteran watchers, I strongly suggest to not judge this Netflix Series as a serious homage to the original. View this as its own thing with heavy references to its source material. For new comers, enjoy the 70% good drama and 30% cringe."
tom_maxey,Haters gonna hate,8/10,6 December 2021,"This is easily the best live action interpretation of an anime that has been made. It takes the original, action packed anime expands on it in every way. Instead of being episodic, it's serialized. Instead of insinuating to backstory, it shows it. And instead of clunky English translations, it's performed in English. The casting is great Cho does a perfect job at capturing the troubled but nonchalant Spike, Shakir pull of a great impression of the original English dubbed Jet while also being the father figure of the ship. And Penida does a great job as Faye, who I'll remind people has come out of cryo sleep with no memory, for her to immediately be a badass femme fatale would be jarring, the original anime realized that, but fans forgot. So called fans would like to pick every little thing apart rather than basking in the glow of Bebop being relevant again.

alexmannwee,Probably unpopular take but...,7/10,20 November 2021,"I highly regard the original as one of the greatest television series of all time so with that in mind, I set aside my expectations completely.There's almost no point in trying to point out where they went wrong or if they went wrong because topping the original is simply impossible. So again with this in mind, I just watched 'a show' and hoped it was going to be entertaining.Surely enough there were some dialogue issues most frequent in episodes with certain writers (which I won't mention), but that's to be expected of netflix right? I mean at this point we know they just don't understand cringe enough to separate themselves from it, but some of the campiness totally worked. I initially hated vicious, but after a few episodes I realised that they'd really worked on having Hassell be in character and even though at first my cringe compass was spinning in circles, he eventually grew on me.Oddly enough my favourite part about the show was how much Cho seemed to be in the role as well, even in the action scenes which I'd not expected from an actor with that kind of background and clunky netflix writing aside you can tell the whole cast wanted to be there.I wasn't a fan of how they tried to inject weird subtext into things, bdsm and transplay/fetishism everywhere (typical netflix stuff nothing to see here) but if it bothers you just skip it like I did and ""edit"" the show to your liking- I don't mean to refer to the trans characters/actors in the show which afaic didn't detract in any way from the experience- I mean the fetishised/sexualisation of everything, at least I don't recall the original being so heavily inclined towards this.I just want to say that there are some episodes where what they did with Faye is obnoxiously beyond understanding, and things were cut and changed and muddled around but I suppose it was less to do with her and more to do with having her enter the show early enough to fill netflix's ""woman-o-meter"". Even so, she grew on me too.No it wasn't just like the original, but if you can set that aside it's a half decent scifi/almost-a-but-not-really-sort-of-space-western. I actually started this show while in the middle of rewatching firefly, which kinda really made it stand out
how they sort of missed the 'cowboy' part of the bebop show.Either way, it's still not bad imho."
mrjayjamesslater,Very Very Verrrry different....but still really good!,10/10,22 November 2021,"I'm a huge fan of the anime - in fact I was not happy about the casting of some people (*Ahem! HER!! Lol). I had low expectations and even forgot about when the release date was.So to my surprise, I stumbled upon it and thought, meh, why not. Boy am I glad I did!It's done in a very different but relevant tone - I mean c'mon, do you want the anime copied into a live action? Of course not! It's done really well!!And the casting which I was very skeptical of, is fantastic! Mustafa Shakir
as Jet Black is amazing, Daniella Pineda was starting to annoy me at first until I realized ""Hey wait...she's JUST like Faye""! Well done. And of course, Jon is a delight to watch man! He surprises me in the best ways every time I watch him. This is just up his alley and it's done so really well.So my question to all the hardcore fans is this: What exactly are you upset about? That it's not a live action replica? That it's losing some of the wit and humor? That's it's not exactly what you pictured it to be? I mean what is it!!??Watch this with an open mind. This show is great and done clean and so very well. It deserves a chance to give us what it's trying to narrate... and honestly, its doing a sterling job so far.Well done! Worth a watch...again."
msubhashfeb,This is traumatizing,1/10,20 November 2021,"The hope for good live adaptation for one piece has been destroyed by this one. I am now scared. Netflix should drop doing these things of they are not good at it instead of spoiling it.

sakiververis,Soul and charm,10/10,25 December 2021,"The casting on this show alone makes it one of the most watchable things I've seen in the last 5 years. The story telling is solid. My only critique is that I just saw that they didn't pick it up for a second season, which is such a bad call. My brothers and I grew up watching the original series. As fans, we have all found our way to this version and enjoy it as true to the characters and the vibe of the original. I was excited to see where they would go with this cast, and these characters who have been with me for a long time. I am a fan of this version, hats off to the ones who made it happen. But haters got to hate, they cannot help themselves. It is their nature.

jamesjohnson-82257,Amazing Show - Ignore the Haters,10/10,24 November 2021,"All of these people giving low ratings didn't stick around for episodes 8-10, which were amazing. The show captures the essence of the anime, but delves into the backstories in a masterful way, particularly towards the end of the first season. Amazing cast and performances all around.

Pappa_Chainsaw,"I liked it, BUT WHY DOES MY OPINION MATTER?!?!?!?!",9/10,28 November 2021,"I watched the anime awhile back and I loved it. It was an interesting and fun romp. The characters, the art, the music, the story... I could see this future and these characters and want to be a part of their lives. So when i saw this live action series I was skeptical... I mean lets be honest many of the ""live action"" versions I've seen put out were terrible... but I'd see alot of great shows from Netflicks.So I watched it...
I loved it... I mean sure it isnt 100% the anime BUT how can it be? These are real people interacting... some things dont flow... some things dont work just because an anime said they would.. some things change...
...not to mention they may only have 1 season to grab people and tell the story... so some things get streamlined and some things get cut...
...but to criticize it as ""bad"" or a ""joke"" or ""terrible"" or any of the other things some of these people are saying is just being mean spirited...
These actors did a great job on this. The shows are well made and edited together giving it a feeling of the anime (maybe not to some nitpicking troll BUT to ME) Every episode contained things I remembered from the anime sometimes it was slightly different but it was like seeing a familiar story I could enjoy in a completely new way....btw to say its ""low budget"" is just stupid I've WATCHED alot of low budget stuff. Some of that can be a pearl and some can be trash BUT this was NOT low budget. The scenes are too professional and the sets and props too well made.All in all I enjoyed this series and I would watch it again and I would watch another season if it was made this well... BUT I dont know what others like or enjoy so why does MY opinion matter? Watch it yourself and tell us what you think.Take care Cowboys and be safe out there."
bb-772-999720,I liked it,8/10,15 December 2021,"I'm not a fan of the source story nor the typical target audience for such shows but I really enjoyed watching this one, up until the love story starts to take over the plot. What I found great was the visual side to the show, stunningly beautiful sets, altogether believable yet totally paradoxical futuristic world with an indie touch to it. Actingwise good performance from the lead actors and some supporting cast. However, as the story unfolds it starts to become chaotic and the main plot itself is not really original or even interesting, to the point that I wished they would explore side stories instead. Each episode a new adventure would've worked for me. Unfortunately, they won't get the chance as the show got cancelled.

derekmccoul,Forget the haters,9/10,4 December 2021,"If you watch this show for what it is, which is a fun take on the anime, you will like it. Great acting, unique cinematography. I enjoyed the character arc development and the episodic writing, it all blended well together. I wasn't sure what to think originally of the casting choices, but they all ended up being great. Huge thumbs up. Well worth watching.

bryan-d-ellison,Not even worth hate watching. Watch the original.,3/10,21 November 2021,"I came into this with bad expectations, but hoping to be surprised or at least maybe it wouldn't be as bad as most people thought it would be.You can tell the creators didn't get this from frame 1. Why? Each episode started with the opening credit sequence. That puts you in the mood and immediately lets you know kinda what it's about. Instead, they open with a bounty, and man, it's bad. All the fight choreography looks like it's rehearsals. The lines are cheese and they're delivered with out conviction. It looks super cheap with regards to the set dressing. It's shot flatly and inconsistently, a big pet peeve for me. The editing is slightly off. I mean, this is the first scene. These issues continue.The Beebop looks good. The space SFX looks good.Jets arm looks like it's made of foam painted.If you don't know, they're basically copying the anime as far as scenes and story goes, but changing things for the worst. It shows a lack of creativity. Faye is not Faye. Period. This one is not better. Cho is fine, but imo cast wrong. Even though he's race swapped, Mustafa does a good job as Jett.I can't watch all of this, but skipped to Mad Piorrot. They couldn't even get that right.They're copying something great without any understanding."
vindaria,The worst adaptation I've ever seen!,1/10,21 November 2021,"How could an old guy be cast as Spike? And Pineda for the role of Faye! Are you kidding me!? This is just a rape of the original! Stop destroying masterpieces with such talentlessness!Netflix has a tradition - to spoil everything that their hands can reach .. You were told right away that the actors are not suitable for these roles, but you didn't listen to anyone and did it your way! And this is a disgusting interview with Pineda, where she says - look what they give and be happy .. Disgusting .. There are simply no words ..

chrsstout,Not terrible,6/10,23 November 2021,"It's a decent re-telling of the anime. I mean as good as it can be for Hollywood's tendency to rehash old stuff for money.So whatever. Casting is OK. Cinematography was actually pretty good. Acting was pretty good too. Keeps the pacing of the anime.I think there's a universal law that says if it's a live-action re-telling of an anime, there will be a considerable amount of people who will hate it.It's also kind of dumb to just....do the same thing as the Anime. Like it's just boring. I've seen this. Why not expand on the universe? Make it something unique.Overall it's pretty good. If you're not familiar with the anime and this is more palatable to you, It's decent comedy action sci-fi based on a cartoon. Not much to expect from the genre, so just appreciate it for what it is."
rblafosse,This is a hoot,9/10,30 November 2021,"It is not often you see a display of imagination come forth like that seen in Cowboy Bebop. A heady mixture of steam punk, film noir gritty detective story and flippant, self deprecating humour.If nothing else it is immensely entertaining. Shades of Max Headroom and Terry Gilliam peculate through in the visuals. Jazz wafts through the soundtrack peppering it with that 50's feel - as do the cars that share the moons with space vessels.This is almost a new genre - retro space bounty hunter funk with an infusion of that beatnik cafe sound. The villains are cartoonishly outlandish. Lines between the good guys and the bad guys are clearly drawn. There is a somewhat lacklustre attempt to create a compelling backstory for one of the main characters, but it thankfully does not take up a lot of screen time.A must see."
orochi-66238,Soulless and uninspiring.,3/10,19 November 2021,"The live action version of cowboy bebop is soulless and misses the mark from the original. It seems like they try to hit the nostalgia train by every now and then using quotes from the anime completely out of context. It just seems like a fan of cowboy bebop got a bunch of people to cosplay characters to try and reenact cowboy bebop scenes.

vikavi1254,Review with respect to Other-Media,10/10,20 November 2021,"I am a hardcore anime fan, you might find it hard to believe by what I'm rating. But remember its very hard to please the ANIME Community.So, in comparison to other movies and adaptations, except comparing it to legendary Cowboy Bebop Anime.... They have done much better than expected.The CGI is great and cast is good enough with a hint of comedy.Once again, its very hard to please the ANIME Community. And we should at least appreciate that all the anime which were hated and grossed a few years ago and looked down upon is getting a mainstream reputation.There are still many countries where anime is looked as taboo and anime-watchers are looked as nerds, geeks and idiots.Hence, they did a good job!"
ryogo2,Terrible,1/10,24 January 2022,"I mean the music is awful! Whoever is responsible for that needs never work again. And the lead female actress is super annoying. And the writing stinks, The show stinks full stop. The cgi was quite good other than that nothing good is happening here.

RvBreukie,A 'gift' wrapped in flayed skin.,3/10,21 November 2021,"It certainly was ambitious trying to fill such huge boots, but they sure did managa to. By that I mean they punched the soles out, tore the fabric apart, strangled your pet with the laces, made a 'meal' of it all, forced it down your throat and expect you applaud the abomination.They had a great story draw inspiration from, but instead chose to butcher it, flay it and wear it's skin hoping you wouldn't notice the soul is missing.Miscasting of main characters(for example Spike is supposed to be around 27 years old and despite still being that young he is already this worn dowwn by life because of what he's seen and experienced, his young age really makes that hit home. This 'Faye' completely misses the point, driving force, mannerisms and overal character of who she is supposed to be. Etc. Etc.), completely missing the vibe of the originals, unneccesarily drawn out episodes, constant mismatch of tonal elements in both acting and writing, amateur acting most of the time, incredibly bad and lazy writing.The music is good though. Seems at least 1 person had some respect for what they were trying to emulate. Sadly that isn't enough to save this piece of rotting, festering afterbirth."
psipavicius1,It goes from pretty good to just pure cringe.,4/10,27 November 2021,"Watching first episode I had hope this would actually be a quality TV series to stand on it's own, but nope...Writing goes from good enough to borderline cringe fest, overall not worth watching, if you start get bored by ep 3-4, don't bother.

belairophon,A few qualms. But I'd watch season 2.,8/10,25 November 2021,"Was thrown off from the first episode. That is one hell of a gamble (like he said he was there to do), to kick a coin into someone's face. Even if you've been trained to be an assassin all of your life, I'm sure he did not have a lot of time to practice a move like that to guarantee it would work. The flashback to him taking out an entire cartel was more believable somehow.Mustafa Shakir was an excellent choice for Jet, hands down the best casting choice and character in the show, in my opinion.John Cho did OK at pulling off Spike's mellow but badass when he needs to be demeanor.Daniella Pineda was a character... with small juggs. Meh, I'm just kidding they're nice, sure, whatever. But as I'm JK, lol, I guess, she did decent (or her stunt double did) with the action scenes and fights and bubbly personality and stuff.Ed's appearance at the end was slightly over the top, although it was spot on. It would be hard to imagine that Eden Perkins wouldn't be exhausted after every workday trying to act like that all day all of the time if season 2 does get greenlit.But with the twist the show has going on, I really wonder what the hell they could possibly do for season 2... and would definitely watch it regardless, because season 1 did have some great feels."
danylopereklita,Not the best,4/10,19 November 2021,"I'm a huge cowboy bebop fan and I think the live action misses some things that the anime has. First the acting of most of the side characters is completely atrocious. I find that they give no effort in their lines or they're not cast probably. It's better with the main characters with Faye and Jett being casted relatively well and with spike I think John Cho does an alright job for him. Although he's a bit older than spike I think he plays him relatively well.During episode 1 I found a lot of small mistakes that really bugged me and I love small things in tv shows and movies I find that they help make it more interesting and realistic. And we get to see Julia at the end. I think that this was a big mistake since in the anime you only really see her at the end. She is not important enough in the anime and I think that was a great writing choice because in the last few episodes in thr anime it keeps you hooked.The music I find was not like the anime, not saying it's all that bad but i wouldn't have minded just copy pasting the music from the anime into the live action since it was amazing. And in the live action I find that they use the music a bit too much.The only really good thing in the live action was the set. I found the set extremely well made and really brings the live action to lifeTo summarize, the live action has lazy writing and casting with sub par music and a great set design. If you like the anime I'm not sure you would enjoy the live action since there are so many things that you could point out that the anime did better."
Headturner11,I,6/10,21 April 2023,"Usually don't watch stuff like this but it looked quirky and kinda Tarintinoish. Lol. A low budget rip off! Some of it was decent but with better acting, writing and directing it could have been really good! Scenes didn't flow well were cheesy and the acting ranged from dismal to awful! If Jet Black mentioned that D##mn doll one more time I was going to gouge my eyes out! I'm not familiar with John Cho but was sad to find out he has no martial arts experience! I'm not an action fan but I enjoyed some of his fight scenes and he seemed proficient to learn he was not was a huge disappointment! I still have a few episodes left and i like the weirdness of it etc I just wish it was done better!

klingbeil-02990,what really killed the show,5/10,12 December 2021,"If you want to know what really killed the show, it's Daniella Pineda's wooden acting. Strawberry Shortcake dolls on Robot Chicken can show more emotion and perform better fight choreography.Aside from the train wreck of casting Pineda as Faye (seriously, did she have blackmail on the casting director?), Shakir as Jet was a pretty good choice and I'm warming up to Cho as Spike (despite him looking like he should be Spike's grandfather). If you can mentally detach the show from the anime and view it as something that is similar, but different, then the show is passable and not completely terrible.I do hate that they turned stone cold Vicious into an emo cry baby and turned super soldier Gren into some sort of androgenous freak at a cabaret.

bertrandborn,meh- bad... anime 1000x better,3/10,14 December 2021,"Generally a good idea to make a cowboy bebop film. But this remake of the series is mediocre and a lot worse than the original Anime.Especially, the lead actor John Cho is just badly cast, looks ridiculous in the Spike outfit and lame in fight scenes, and is generally sooooo annoying. He was irritating and not funny in all his other movies, and this one is no exception.In summary: little need to watch this.. check out the original anime - it's so much better.

ljwalter-98621,Leave your Baggage at the Door,10/10,24 November 2021,"If you go into this show looking for a faithful adaptation, you're gonna have a bad time.This show adapts the essential anime watch Cowboy Bebop, and as anyone knows, that rarely goes well. I've personally never seen it go well.However, if you watch the show as a show, and leave your comparisons behind, this show is FANTASTIC. Great direction, the music is a given, and the cast absolutely crushes it. The show doesn't perfectly align with the show, and that's okay. A seasoned Bebop lover will be frustrated by the disassociation from the show, there's more profanity, more comedy, and generally the whole mood feels different.Is that a problem? NOT IN THE LEAST! Forget about your preconceived notions and enjoy the ride. It's better than anything else you'll see on Netflix right now.

fransmaroki,I actually really liked it.,8/10,25 November 2021,"I thought the acting was quite great, and i just generally enjoyed the show, i am big fan of cowboy bebop having watched it as a kid in the 90's there is alot of nostalgia there, take this for what it is, something different, its not bad i am generally pretty disappointed with most of the live action remakes.

doctorevil-20284,"So, so",4/10,22 November 2021,"Wrong actor to play Spike. It's too bad when the animation is so much better than the live action. I would have preferred a more neo-noir setting something like Blade Runner. As far as I'm concerned I give this tv show a fail.

nicolasboeyer,An amazing show,9/10,22 November 2021,"A very good show! The bad reviews are almost exclusively from fans of the comic series who apparently expected an exact copy instead of an adaptation.The actors are well chosen and deliver good performances. The casting of the series is sometimes heavily criticized because the actors are not similar enough to the comic characters: But that's not the point for me, as the actors are not supposed to fit the comic roles but the roles in this adaptation. And they do that excellently!Visually and musically, Cowboy Bebpop delivers nicely as well. Good cinematography that presents a retro-futuristic noir-neon world very well and always backs it up with good music. Add to that the quirky, idiosyncratic humor that sometimes expresses itself in well-done situational comedy and sometimes in linguistic wit.All in all: a great series that is well worth watching! Suitable for anyone who either doesn't know the original or can accept a creative adaptation and doesn't expect just a copy."
SnoopyStyle,live action recreating animated show,7/10,21 April 2022,"Spike Spiege (John Cho) and Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir) are bounty hunters in the future. In the fourth episode, they encounter Faye Valentine (Daniella Pineda) who would join them. They also have data dog.It's a slow start to the show. This is adapted from the animated show in the late 90's. I'm not an original fan. I've only seen the animated one a few years ago. This live-action show does pull from the animation. I would have introduced Valentine much earlier in the pilot episode. Maybe she could come in on the second episode after data dog. The group's chemistry markedly improves after the addition of Daniella Pineda's comedic skills. John Cho was always the straight man but in this one, he has infused Spike with a healthy dose of sadness. In the animated series, I took his character as the cool silent type. They need to bring the team together much quicker. Ed comes in at the end of episode ten and that happened. I don't know who could play Ed but it's not some rando.In the end, this live-action reenactment does try recreate the animated show. It's a good honest effort although I don't think the production design fully achieves it. The group chemistry takes some time to develop and Valentine's humor puts it over the top. On the other hand, I don't know about Valentine's outfit. I get the wish for a less sexualized outfit but it should be more neon yellow. I don't like the brown jacket although the cartoon does have that off-the-shoulders top. Here's the thing. The yellow outfit and her long legs are her most memorable physical attributes. For a show that tries so hard to keep the animated look, it's a little odd to have Valentine look so regular. All in all, I got more and more into the show. Vicious and Julia have some great story work. It's canceled after ten episodes. I don't know the reason. Netflix can be secretive that way. I would have liked to have season two but I would need a different Ed."

jasnuevo,dumb show,4/10,6 December 2021,"I quite dislike this kind of so called sci-fi. I do not get the point of putting together spaceships and retro aesthetics for everything else like for example playing music vinyls. I simply do not get it unless it is some kind of joke in which I do not know which part I play. Finally I do not find main characters specially likeable.

The props and scenes are wonderful as well. Such a silly but dark show. They even made it more modern with the cast and how the sci-fi shows are going.

chemfrog,Main characters casting feels wrong,5/10,19 November 2021,"As a fan of the anime and the main 3 characters just do not fit. It feels off to me. Cho is ok but not believable as a action star, the other 2 are just unfit for the role. The story and side characters are good, effects are good enough. Maybe if you have not seen the anime the casting would not bother you, but see the anime after the show. Also the arrogant comments from Daniella Pineda did not do any favors to the fanbase of the anime. If it is getting you to see the original anime i am content.

killver,Casting,5/10,22 November 2021,"It is quite astonishing how one wrong cast (Faye) can destroy the whole experience so much for me. She just does not fit the actual Faye at all. It was so important to get her right, and they failed fully. Also the cast for some side character s is laughable. I cant make my mind up with Spike, but at least I can see the point there.One more thing I do not get is why they are trying so hard to stay close to the original so many times, but then suddenly deviate where it does not make sense (Bloody Mary).

alarm-27223,Just Fun,9/10,9 December 2021,"OK, you already know that I haven't seen the original series. Cause it seams obvious that everyone who did so hates this thing with passion, while I give it 9 Stars.It's just good fun, the story keeps you hooked, it's well made, looks cool, sounds nice and I do love the setting alot. The overall look and the quality of the visuals are seriously good, not quite Mando level, but close enought. Sulu is in full ace mode here and the rest of the cast can mostly keep up.Pretty easy, 8 Stars, plus one simply to annoy those anime freaks.It's a lovely series, I hope there will be a second season, sadly the bitterness and hate of the anime crew will probably bring it down.

fultomic,"Great show, enjoy it separately from the anime.",9/10,1 December 2021,"All the reviews bombing this are doing so because it varies from the source material. That happens all the time, and doesn't mean outright that something is bad. Case here, this is a good show. Great casting, fun ridiculous stories, and good music and action. It's a good mix of old and new filming, as if Tarantino did a sci-fi tv show.

jaliyahparadigm,Deliriously disengaging Netflix bloat,1/10,20 November 2021,"I hesitate to even call it disrespectful to the source material because it's so far gone in it's misunderstanding of the anime. Instead of an episodic sci-fi series with incomplete yet deeply evocative fragments of characters' pasts; Netflix delivers a serialized attempt at filling in some of those missing pieces at the expense of the poetic melancholy that wove the original together. Overall this adaptation feels like it's source material was thrown in a blender with a leaky lid without so much as a once-over and diluted with cheap Hollywood camp. Sometimes less is more.

grabboid-44815,Wow ... Can't believe they cancelled this,10/10,18 October 2022,"This live action series was awesome! I can't believe they cancelled it over some early low reviews. This series was almost exactly shot by shot of the anime, but it had it's own short twists in it for live action. There's no way the people that rated this series in the beginning ever saw the anime, and I don't think they actually watched this series. I saw a bunch of comments about why they made Jet Black character black 😑.... A big red flag was the majority of the reviews were put out during 1st premier. Look, if you like the anime, you will like this series. Simple. It's shot for shot. The characters act the exact same as the anime characters, and they look very similar to each character. I loved it, and I'm sad to see that it was cancelled before the real fans of the anime actually were able to watch it.

albrantjes,Killed too soon,9/10,17 December 2021,"Giving this a 9.Anime is one of my faves (although it is starting to be a bit daggy) think they did a great job to deliver a new adaption and I believe could of been better than the original given the chance to run longer. Had enough original content to throw back to the anime,but enough new to make it that you weren't just watching the same same.Liked the stylised approach they took to make it feel more like a cartoon, reminiscent of dick tracy, and the set,prop and visuals were fantastic.I actually felt that the character development was going to be great, and thought the cast was a good choice for the show.Believe that they probably could of made it a little more hooking by perhaps selecting some of the more exciting bounties from the original Ie the truckers in the mine.Heres to hoping they pick up a second season to at least wrap the story in a similar amount of ep as the original."
galazkam,Great adaptation but not perfect but what adaptation is.,8/10,19 November 2021,"I'm only 2 episodes in so I cant speak for the whole series but I think the did a great adaption. There are lines that come across better In the anime, I'm not sure if that's the actor not sure how to convey it or if the anime just lends itself to these lines that come off as cheese in live action. I believe the acting is done well the action scene are fun to watch, they are over the top but that's how animes are unrealistic jhon wick stuff. Some of the more dramatic stuff can get lost as music doesnt fit the live action quite as nice as the anime. For instance the saxophone over the flashback felt like it didnt quite line up right like it did in the anime. I was on the fence about giving this a 8 even some time it feels like a 7. All and all I think it's a great adaption it not going to hit the same way the anime does but it has enough of the elements, it doesnt go completely off the rails like american death note adaption. I feel it does a good job so far staying true to the anime for being in the medium of live action.

trawlinson1980,Just watch it.,6/10,22 November 2021,"Don't compare it to the anime, they're two separate things and one doesn't ruin the other. Stop reading these reviews, watch it and make up your own mind like I did. I really enjoyed it.

RichardBJ-1,Disappointing End,8/10,13 December 2021,"No spoilers so can't really say why, but I found the key character morphing at the end just didn't fit with how they had been played until that point.A great series though, starts by looking like it is just going to be hour upon our of kick arse and explosions - but it is quite a bit more complex than that. So I felt it really developed and drew me in. Albeit with a cold at home and not a lot else to do!I thought the actors were all really great.Likeable goodies, dreadful baddies. To gory for me (that will get a down vote!). But I know that is popular with kids.So anyway, I recommend it and hope they have a second series that sort or repairs the end of this."
herenri2010,Campy AF and I love it,8/10,19 November 2021,"I never seen the original anime series so I can't tell you you if it's true to source material but I do love the series so far, 4 episodes in so far, it's campy, it's sprinkled with noir detective movies from the 40s, 70s vibes with a dash of 80s cop movies partnerships, special effects are good especially for a Netflix budgets oh best part is that the series gives you Firefly vibes like traveling to different worlds and no alien life j.

peter-k-nets,Wonderful adaptation,9/10,12 December 2021,"I was very skeptical at first, and yet this show hit every note for me. The cast, the set, the changes they did to the original story!That's how you approach such projects - you make them your own, without retelling the original you keep the same vibe. And they did it - it's like Cowboy Bebop from an alternative universe.So it's very sad that the show is cancelled. I stil hope that there is a chance of a second season, because the story is definitely far from over.

freakinyatch,Vibe Was Spot On,8/10,22 November 2021,"Expectation management is important going into a series like this, as it's impossible for a live action adaptation to live up to the anime and vice versa. The acting was great with some characters (Jett Black did very well even though he doesn't look like the original), the action scenes amateurish, but the atmosphere, music, and cinematography were very well done. All-in-all, a well done series.

heissfuss,Dialogue falls flat,6/10,26 November 2021,"I understand that they can't recreate a lot of the anime action, but they could do a much better job with the line deliveries. Pacing also feels off. Spike's actor in particular just doesn't capture the heart of the character. Most of the other actors are much better, but overall it's a shadow of the original anime.

ericeguia,Haters can go eat turds.

John Cho is perfect for the role of Spike Spiegel. Live action might not be as great as the original anime but it's still pretty good and worth a watch.

Another show cancelled because you had to complain like you do with every other show out there... and now we are left with the same old lame tv shows going on 25 seasons like NCIS, CSI, Law and Order..... I'm so tired of troll critics complaining about every new show that has potential out there, if you are so smart why don't you come out with your own show. I'm almost 50 and am a huge fan of the original Cowboy Bebop anime, I didn't dislike the new show by any means, I actually had fun watching it... no actual show will ever match an anime....

santiagovicente-18165,Kill it with fire!,2/10,20 November 2021,"This monstrosity is a sad imitation of the classic anime. It bears names and impressions of the original, but it lacks the spirit, the soul that gave the work its timelessness.Characters are unimaginative ""re-imaginings"" of the originals. Highlight for ""Faye Valentine"" (or should I say Vaye Falentine), one of the most uninteresting, annoying and bossy characters to appear in the worst works of this year.Spike suffers from the actor's casting, which fails to bring out the charm of the original character and the same can be said of Jet Black (by the way, just because a character is called ""Black"" doesn't mean he has to be played by a person of color. )
Having said that, a body without a soul, as is the case in this version of Cowboy Bebop, is nothing more than a corpse and as such deserves a dignified burial or at least a cremation.

robbyt-75987,"Honestly, what were people expecting....",6/10,24 November 2021,"Shakespeare in the Park?It's a live adaptation of one of the more ridiculous animes from the 90's and, for better or for worse, its pretty faithful to the source material.I mean really, think back to 1998, if you can, and try to remember the actual anime. It wasn't particularly good, and it wasn't because it was among powerhouses like DragonBall, Inuyasha, YuYu Hakusho, Sailor Moon, or even Pokemon. It had a very niche target audience, that was pretty much growing out of anime, as one does, and didn't really fit the anime formula.So yeah, the live action version is going to reflect that. That's said, the live action version is the most anime thing I've ever seen.

NightCourtTheMovie,Not Perfect but Impressive,9/10,1 December 2021,"Anime is a whole other medium to live action American drama. When combining the two sacrifices are needed as one cannot 100% directly adapt the other. This version of Cowboy Bebop is a worthy tribute to the outstanding anime series. The 3 main actors all pull their weight and hold their own despite changes to the character arcs. Faye Valentine had the most deviation from the anime but Daniella Pineda still makes her character fun to watch.The visuals are fantastic and the music as with the original is perfect.Now if you haven't seen the anime would you consider this a good show? Probably not. It exists to serve the anime. The anime was translated into English for American broadcast and the live action is a translation from animated anime script and dialog . It doesn't jive well unless you know the original and understand this is an adaptation.Having said that though it might appeal to some non anime fans as the concept, art, music and actors all pull this together.I liked this show and hope they do just one more season to tie up loose ends.Spoiler Alert: To me the absence of Radical Ed was favorable. In the original her character was irritating and confusing. Probably the most annoying thing about the show. Why was an 11 year old talking like a 4 year old? Again perhaps this is the translation from Japanese to American that makes this awkward but nevertheless the character was annoying. I hope the live action version doesn't completely adopt all the originals Radical Ed's mannerisms."
Anton_Ego,Great potential - Terrible directing and editing,1/10,29 November 2021,".. Well I start as a colossal fan of the original Anime . It was great of Netflix to release both the original and new series together. The original is hip, fast moving, creative, sassy clearly the opening credits influenced Archer, a real joy to watch..The new series, oh dear, oh dear. No pace appalling direction, there are moments when characters are just waiting for other characters to speak, not for effect just bad direction. The actors have been in other shows successfully so its not them. I appreciate its probably difficult to film as the drawn version is so tightly directed and editied. But it really comes over as clueless. I have not got past the first episode of the remake, but really enjoying the Anime. Too much money gone to special effects and not enough to the bones of the piece.Just imagine if Joss Whedon was behind the camera, oh wait....

timboc-19918,"Not bad, until it was.",4/10,8 December 2021,"Potential Spoilers:
Watched the original anime again in anticipation of this to drop. Really enjoyed most of it, but the last episode felt like a ""how can we twist this plot to allow for a second season?"" Combined with ""how can we screwball this ending in the most meaningless gotcha we can make?"" The WTF expression was plastered on my face for the last 15 minutes of the season as I literally couldn't believe how completely warped the characters became. Faye is the only character that left the final episode remotely intact. Pure butchery. Really wanted to like this."
jmandawg,Way better than the negative press/reviews would have you believe,10/10,16 January 2022,"I almost let all the negative reviews/press ruin this for me. Cowboy Bebop Live Action (LA) was actually pretty good if you watch it all the way through. Most people are just watching the first episode or possibly even just the first 15 minutes and calling it quits and giving a bad review. At first I was like the anime is so much better, this is garbage, no one looks like their anime counterpart, but... after watching it all the way through it's really good, it delves more into the back story of Spike, and all the characters really grow on you after a while. Jet was prob the closest to his character in the anime (although in the anime his skin was a gray color?!) What really sucks is since so many cry babies whined about it, season 2 got cancelled. I would give it a solid 8.5 but will give it a 10 to cancel out some of the really negative reviews.

This is not ""noir"", but goofy. Maybe it has some cool stuff to it - I don't know. But I wasn't at all interested. How can a sophisticated series today start by villains complaining about corporations? Yeah, sure, that is totally the talk of crazy people, uh? I can hear, in my mind, the rich people who paid for this movie talking among themselves: We start with these crazy people who don't like corporations, because they're crazy! And then we get some cowboys to fix it... Some other rich guys askes: Sure, but what kind of cowboys are we talking about? Other dude says: They are cartoon cowboys...

CyricTheCynic,"Not as terrible as fanboys say, but not great",6/10,28 November 2021,"I loved the original anime as well as Samurai Champloo, but I knew to keep my expectations in check when it comes to live action versions.First the good: The show has fairly nice effects and sets and captures the atmosphere of the show well enough. The Jazz score remains and fits the show well. Fanboys have been dunking on the casting reallly hard, but honestly I thought Faye, Spike, and Jet were cast pretty well, all things considered. Faye may not be as sexy/seductive but the actress at least conveys her fiery personality. John Cho is admittedly a bit old to play Spike, but it's hard to hold it against the show when it was in production limbo for years and years.Now the bad: Vicious. First off, the casting of him just feels off, the actor just doesn't look the part and his exaggerated acting makes him seem less scary and more like some frustrated badass-wannabe. Also, he is in like EVERY episode, along with Julia, which really detracts from the mystery surrounding him in the anime. I can understand that maybe the show wanted to have more of a focus on a main antagonist, but it's just strange they made the choice to add so many more scenes with him and Julia when they otherwise copied episodes and story beats straight from the anime. Also the weird direction they took in the last episode is a bit of a head-scratcher.Overall, if you haven't seen the anime, you'd probably enjoy this show on its own as a pretty good sci-fi romp, but it certainly isn't as good as the anime."

erincarrott,Fun and unique,9/10,25 November 2021,"I enjoyed the anime, but I also enjoyed this show! I thought it really came into its own in episode 3. The actors were great (love Ein) and I loved the noir style. It is beautifully shot. Watch this for itself, don't compare it to the anime because they made changes. That being said, I don't think the changes are bad, they move the story and add character development.

SCIFIshant,See You Later Space Cowboy!,9/10,3 January 2022,"Although the casting for this reboot was odd, the actors were surprisingly phenomenal and grew on me with each episode. As a fan of the original anime I had high expectations and I'd be lying to say those expectations haven't been met with this version.In Cowboy Bebop you follow ex-con turned bounty hunter Spike as he takes on menacing foes while simeltaneously confronting his past. It's an emotional rollercoaster with gorgeous music, quirky villains and a variety of unique planets that are so beautifully crafted it's almost overwhelming! Cowboy Bebop is a new take on a classic formula, but still retains the retro styling, fantastic soundtrack and phenomenal storyline of the original. I don't understand the hate and it's because of this that I would highly recommend this series to anyone.

kitfair-63625,Honestly great. WTF are the haters on about? This is the Star Wars of our time!,10/10,21 November 2021,"This series slaps! Yeah, I did have a moment of dissonance adjusting to live action from anime but honestly the show itself is great and the actors nail it! So much fun! It keeps just enough of the vibe and zany-ness of the anime. Honestly, I loved it. Kudoz to everyone involved!!!

pbstarman,Too Much Gun Violence,2/10,19 November 2021,"The special effects are stellar.... I love science fiction. Unfortunately, for me, this series is all about sensationalizing foul language, shooting guns, killing people and blood. Too violent.

postit-1,"Badly casted, cheap looking boredom.",3/10,23 November 2021,"I find it super funny that there are guys that call those people names that dislike the show because it has so little to do with the Anime. Well because the show is called Cowboy Bepop. And therefore it should get close to the original.But it doesn't: Spike Spiegel is supposed to be 24, yet John Cho (who is 50!) looks like an Asian grandma with his hairstyle. Jet Black should be looking older and also shouldn't be black but I guess we can't have shows without racial appeasement anymore. Same goes for Faye Valentine, who in the Anime talks about her Roma (gipsy) inheritance but is some kind of Asian Latina now. OK.The casting, alas, total crap. Same goes for the set design. Why would a spaceport on a distant planet have WW2 planes standing around? Why are all cars from the 70ies? Why do they use CRT monitors from the 90ies? Why do the cities look like out of a cheap Western? I have no problem with retro look, but this just looks super cheap and lacking in ideas.Since the story is also quite boring this show is an abomination of a remake and 3/10 at best."
msghall,Daniella Pineda saves the day with a star-making performance.,6/10,6 December 2021,"There are moments in this series when everything comes together and it's a lot of fun. Unfortunately, those moments only come so often. Thankfully, Daniella Pineda breathes life into her character with wit and bravado, After a few episodes, I found myself advancing ahead through the boring conversations involving the other characters until Faye Valentine appeared.

codysware,"Love the anime version, really like the live action.",8/10,20 November 2021,"Do not go into this expecting a whole new series of adventures for the BeBop, or a shot for shot, line for line, remake. Enjoy the actors bringing the characters to life in the same style and feel of the original series with their own little twists.Many people are complaining about the actor choices, music, style, feel or trying to redo what they believe was a ""perfect"" series. I think many of their complaints are based on their own personal expectations and are a little unfair.I think the live action version catches the feel and style of the anime very well. The music is right in line, the visuals, fight scenes and dialogue are good.I really enjoy the choices for casting as well. You aren't going to get the look of the anime characters perfectly as well as get a good actor that can bring the character to life. They did a good job with the chosen actors.If you are coming to this without seeing the anime, the show may seem odd and I recommend watching a few episodes of the anime first to understand the feel and style the creators are going for.If you are coming to this expecting a repeat of ""perfection"", you will be disappointed.It is a good solid ""live action remake"" that stays true to it's roots and the creator's vision while trying to bring anime characters to life with talented actors."
leray-54475,Bummed they're not making anymore :(,9/10,11 December 2021,"I created an IMDb account to post this review. I was not expecting this show to be that good... the teaser they put out was just so bad and the original show is just so good. But you know what? Netflix did a pretty bang up job. Sure, John Cho is just a little too old to play Spike, despite doing a very solid job. And yes, it was a little cheesy. But the original was really cheesy! They music was on-point! They managed to capture the essence of Faye in the most perfect, kick-ass, respectful way (you could finally see past her boobs!). Very bummed they decided not to make a second season. I was really excited to see what they were going to do with Ed.

franziskaschade-69316,I love my found family,10/10,13 December 2021,"The highlight of the show are the three main characters Spike, Jet, and Faye. Their chemistry is great. Honestly, I could've watched the whole season just seeing them banter and trying to catch bounties. But I'm also a sucker for found families. And I was so excited to see more of Ed. I already fell in love with the character in the short time I saw her.Was really disappointed to hear that it got canceled. Yeah, the show had its flaws too (cough Vicious cough). But I'm sure they could've improved that in a second season. Shows need more time especially when you release the whole season at once, they're not brilliant from the get-go and they need time to build an audience.

amiteshbiswas,"One Word! ""Disappointing""",1/10,28 November 2021,"This remake version is an utter disappointment. As compare to the legacy of the anime, this netflix adaptation is a complete waste. The best part of the series is the jazz music and the casting to some extent, specially Spike's and Jet Black's. Both reminds me of the anime characters in lot many ways. However the characterisation and the backstory changes had made the series a total waste. Whatever I liked in first few episodes of the series, the later half of the series just crushes everything. There are more cons than pros in this series. The fun part is I watched the entire anime again to refresh and clear my mind after watching the Netflix series.DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!

visne,I don't know why its downvoted...,9/10,22 November 2021,"I watched the episode 5 now and so far so good to watch. It's like watching the anime as a live action, everything is mostly same, even some soundtrack came with same anime scenes. I would admit that John Cho might look too old for Spike, but I can see that he is doing his best. I kept my expectations low when I saw Cowboy Bebop on Netflix, but I'm very satisfied to watch until now. And of course, Jazzy soundtracks blows me away... That was a very good choice to keeping Yoko Kanno's music as same as the anime.I recommend this series who is considering to watching it.

Was hoping for a more Blade Runner feel. Reminds he more of the 60's Batman treatment. Live action masquerading as a comic. Not sure yet though. Giving it a 7 for effort.

John Cho from being in so many comedies wasn't expecting him to play the role of Spike.Of course this show had some weaknesses but the camera quality, the casting, the angle shots, ALLL were great.Grant it some people may not look identical to the ANIME but we're using humans? Like of course Jet not gonna look as big? Who do you want lol. Julia she looked beautiful so do not hate on how she looks. Half of you guys need to stop hating on her.The show lacks in some parts but i'm excited for season 2.

nickingriola,Better than expected,9/10,18 January 2022,"No live action anime adaptation is ever going to be 100%. I have a huge judgement on these kinds of movies/shows. But this came out really good from a very popular anime. They stuck to the story with minor changes and i love spikes and jets actors. They portrayed them as best as they could have, it isn't 100% but better than i expected.I feel people are a little too hard on the show, which is understood for being a very popular anime. They kept the soundtrack, the style, and the story. I was disappointed to find out they canceled the show?! Go figure. When they FINALLY get it right, they cut it. I knew this was too good to be true. They're wrong for cancelling the show.Im hoping they rethink and bring back the show anyway.

That's a damn good thing too!This show packs a punch with its casting. John Cho and Mustafa Shakir bring Spike and Jet to life with amazing finesse. Danielle Pineda somehow brings home the heart of the BebopSure, some moments get a tad out of hand (not looking at Spike's covert 'Mommy' fetish."

em-y,This is a fun little series with some amazing music,9/10,23 November 2021,"This is a fun little series that gets better as it gets along. Nice atmosphere, great music, the two main protagonists are great, very likeable.There are lots of reviews complaining, oh, it's not like in the comics or it's not like the animated series... the actors don't look right etc, etc, etc... Seriously? I used to get upset about that kind of stuff when I was a teenager. Before I realised that an adaptation of a source material is exactly that - an adaptation and not a word for word copy of the original. The people who who make movies/tv-series based on comics/books are not in the business of doing word for word copies of someone else's work. They're creatives with their own ideas. I don't know the source material and I have only seen 1 episode of the animated series. And yes, Spike is younger and Cho doesn't look like him, yes, imagine that - he doesn't look like an anime character. But he does a great job at creating a compelling version of Spike - the way he talks, stands, moves - and a very likeable character. Shakir is great, too. I don't know what Fay was supposed to be like but she's fine with me, annoying at times, but so what? Love Gren and they guy who plays him, such lovely voice. The music is amazing.There are some weak points, sure. The weakest two - Julia and Vicious. The performances are poor - Hassel is always bad, don't know how this guy has any sort of career; didn't know Satine before, seems I didn't miss much, not much of an actress and I just couldn't believe that Fearless would be so in love - why?To make a long story short: If you're a fan of the comics/anime and expect adaptations of your favourites to always be 100% faithful to the source material then this might not be for you. If you like sci-fi, enjoyed Firefly, like a bit of humour, buddy comedy, some action scenes, don't mind, or maybe even like jazz, have an open mind - go for it. You might enjoy it. It really isn't bad. In fact it's a likeable and fun little series. I hope Netflix will make another season."
pnevarez-32316,Why'd you stop w/only One season?,10/10,15 July 2022,"I'm disappointed that a good show like this is made with only a few episodes than no more seasons? I'm sick of enjoying a show, than it stops. Only problem with show is its been cut off way too soon!!

jafielding,Cool looking remake that missed out on the well written beautiful storytelling of it's superior source.,1/10,20 November 2021,"This remake of a much loved classic is visually well done, but misses the mark in every other category. The reshaping of the story, awful (seriously bad) dialogue, casting of supporting characters, loss of music themed structure, and being packed with (now) classic Netflix ideologies takes a perfect source and bastardizes it into a joke of a reimagining. Spike, Jet, and even Fay are tolerable shadows of excellent characters, but the side cast is where it falls apart. Vicious, the mysterious antagonist to Spikes quippy laissez-faire attitude, is an overexposed quivering coward when he should be silent, dark, and intimidating. Ana, who should be posing as a simple shopkeeper is a loud angry club boss. Gren, a sullen and gentle War on Titan veteran/jazz musician was one of the best characters in fiction history and is now presented as a loud idiot in a dress. Gren's feminine form was an important part of the Jupiter Jazz story arch and is just a prop in this bastardized version of Bebop. The list goes on... In this version of the classic, the episodes repeat the same ""type"" of bad guy with little variation. Hakim is still awesome, but that's about it. Overall this could have been a decent version of Bebop if the writing and characters could have been given a bit more respect. Making Vicious a fragile coward was a huge mistake that takes the wind out of the story immediately. If I told you this show sucks, I'd expect you to respond with a jubilant ""seems that way""."

keithomusic,Not the mess I tought it would be,5/10,26 November 2021,"Overall enjoyable, but not as good as I had hoped it would be. They did change alot of the story line, that was expected, but for the most part it didn't hurt. The actors had the moves of the characters down, but they had none of the personality of the anime characters nor did they have the interpersonal dynamics of those characters. Then there was the overdone love triangle between Spike, Vicious and Julia, all it was was unnecessary drama, also they gave Jet a family which just added more useless drama. Then there was episode 9 which was a pointless, boring backstory. I kept fast forwarding and asking 'is it over yet?' They could have dispensed with that entire episode and lost nothing of the story. If you are a big fan of the original anime you might not like this, if you have not seen the anime you probably will like this, (except for episode 9 maybe). This could have been better but it was not as bad as I thought it would be."
franco-km8,Welcome to the OUCH!,6/10,28 December 2021,"The original anime is one of the best series ever made and one of my personal favourites ever. I love Shinichiro Watanabe Work. We already knew that this Netflix version was not gonna be so good. We all knew it. But there´re several problems with this. BIG problems. Cho, the actor who plays the chill and cool Spike, is waaay to old for his character. He´s a good actor, but something seems and feels off about him. He is Not Spike, not cool at all. He is like an old maniac version of Spike. Faye acts bad and delivered some cringe moments - and she´s lesbian now for no reason, including a sex scene! -. Mustafa is probably the best of them. He´s doing what he can. Don´t get me wrong. It is not so bad as people are saying. There are some good fights and the music is awesome- thanks to Yoko Kanno who creates the original music from the anime-. Julia and Vicious are absoluty cringe, they are the worst of the series by far. They look and they act like a joke. Vicious acts like a spoiled teenager and sudenly speaks Japanese ""moshi moshi?"" I guess the dog is cute and OK. My recommendation: watch the anime. It´s in Netflix. And watch the movie too. See you Space Cowboy. In the anime."
falacta,Why do they try to copy perfection?,3/10,21 November 2021,"Really the big problem here is to try to copy an iconic anime, which means they immediately compete with a very high standard.It was what did in Ghost in the Shell and Battle Angel Alita. Even if you do make a decent movie/show, the original was outstanding and this feels anemic by comparison. The best scenes in those are where they barely managed to match the original in style, be it kinetic action, visual composition or concept. And they are few and in between. Heck, in one the original is a Manga and still has more kinetic energy than the action flick.Here you get most of the same flaws.Worse of all they actually tried to copy the anime visually, but newsflash, ridiculous anime hair and beards do not translate well into reality! Spike looks ""huh"", Jet ""uhu"" and Vicious ""WTF, is this a joke""? It looks tacky and cheap.The questionable casting choices of the main cast, particularly of Spike and Vicious are made worse because they have to fit into hair styles they simply aren't.Spike is really problematic in that however good the actor, he simply does not match the energy of the original character. Jet is, eh, shave that fake beard, please, Faye I can actually accept because she is the most distinct from the anime character so she can make it her own and does not try to compare in all aspects. She is very different with just some cues so she can behave very differently.Those unconscious visual cues are kind of important.So they probably should have gone for a looser adaption instead of attempting and failing at a visual carbon copy of a classic.That way you at least declared that you want to create something your own, not just suck out the fame of some past show.Which brings to biggest problem: They make carbon copies of the original episodes/story lines.Which means, there is little reason to watch the show because you are better served by the original which has far more suave and style to pull off the quirkiness of its strange genre mix and iconic soundtrack.To producers: If you copy iconic orignals be aware you need to match the heights of what made them great or give it a fresh spin. Otherwise there is zero reason for your work to exist at all and the project probably should not have been done.Sadly it feels this is the case for the Cowboy Bebop live adaption."
wilsojdav,Archer meets Rush Hour in Space,8/10,27 November 2021,"This dark comedy/action adventure is fronted by a classic straight man/renegade pairing. The unconventional duo travel across the galaxy,
from one botched bounty to the next, trying to scrape a living against a backdrop of personal turmoil. The universe as a whole is rich and full of interesting people/places, including an array of hapless comic book villains.As well as the 50s/60s style action (and soundtrack), there is a strong Noir flavour throughout. Yes, some will think this is ""cheesy"", but it pulls it off by being an obvious homage to these genres.Essentially, if you take elements from Guardians of the Galaxy, Archer and Rush Hour, you have this show.Sounds weird (and it is), but it works."
lunaventure,What the heck Big disapointment,2/10,14 December 2021,"I really wanted to like this show but only managed to make it to 10 minutes. The acting was horrible! Have any of the actors ever studied acting? The 1st episode screenplay was along the line of a student film. I guess it will do well for Martial Arts viewers an those who like lots of CG in films. I can't understand why it's even considerd for an award. Perhaps it's for the 16 to 18 year old audience.

justinmparke,A loving homage,10/10,26 November 2021,"I used to watch this on adult swim in college and it fills a specific time and place in my life. Like certain nostalgic things remakes often fail to capture the ennui of the original, and either come up lacking or entirely missing the mark.I came into this not expecting literally anything. The original held a place my heart and so I came in with neutral expectations to straight up expecting a cheesy disaster.This hit a spot that I didn't know could be hit. As the show rolled on even characters I didn't expect to accept as genuinely good eventually settled in as better than adequate and it seems they took the source material and translated it delicately and lovingly.This brings to mind the difference between Zack Snyder's watchmen vs the recent HBO series. Where the HBO series was inspired I often felt that Snyder bought two copies of the graphic novel at Barnes and noble, ripped out the pages and pinned them to cork board to create his story board.I very rarely think anything is ecstatic like I felt this was. The perfect remake or adaptation doesn't try to perfectly replicate the source material-that's impossible. You can't make a graphic novel into a movie without translation. You can't do a stage play and make it a movie, or a movie into a stage play without adapting it to the medium. It must be acknowledged that they will be irreconcilably different, like the difference between revisiting a memory and watching that same moment in a recording only to realize you didn't remember it that way and the applause you got after you hit that shot or made that hilarious joke wasn't quite as boisterous as it was in your mind's eye.This couldn't have been made more perfectly and my only gripe is that spike does not die at the end and Ed wasn't folded into the crew earlier(I suspect this was a requirement from Netflix so that they could cash in some more of if it did well so I'm not faulting anyone but the greedy asses trying to stretch my nostalgia into more cash).If you are one of those types that would never have been satisfied unless you were the one doing the casting and are looking for the version of this you'd make once you got to whatever Heaven your religion prescribes you'll go to if you're well behaved, then you were always going to be disappointed. You can't ever feel like you did when you were 7 on Christmas morning.But this is pretty damn close."
extraplay-61838,This is Good,8/10,17 October 2022,"Cowboy Bebop 2021 doesn't deserve a rating of ten or one.I won't make comparisons with the original animation, but I think this show is an excellent production. The actors are ok and have great chemistry together, and people downgrading it is a bit unfair.This show takes a bold approach to the way it tells the story and tries, to be faithful to the anime.It's a western. It's a space opera. It's a buddy cop comedy. It has a noir atmosphere mixed with ultra-over the top action scenes. All mixed in a crazy colored juice.It deserved a second series.Try it and you may like it.I personally enjoyed all of the episodes, so I wouldn't mind seeing more.A good 8 out of 10 for me."

zilvinas-svitojus-279-642947,Taking the style out of original,5/10,21 November 2021,"We were told there will be no S02 of anime Cowboy Bebop. Instead we got life-action remake! But...It is very hard to like this and I really wanted to. I really did. Cowboy Bebop is one of those rare gems of style driven simple stories that akin to chewing bubble gum on a summer Sunday afternoon making clouds into shapes. What happens when you do not understand that feelings, emotion are driving something and expand it. Suddenly your afternoon is interrupted with phone calls, there is an itch. You remember that you need to do your laundry and tomorrow is work day. You are no longer a kid.This life action remake is all over the place. Dialogues are long and stiff, camera is all over the place, probably because director has no idea what does he want to do. Mustafa Shakir feels like a minor con artist and not a melancholic detective/bounty hunter with ungodly martial arts skills. They are trying to show his inner world, but repeating a flashback of a tragic night 5 times does not induce anything that yawn.Special effects are super cool tho. Unlike fight scenes. One bathroom scene was so bad that it felt like a parody.Had I not seen original - I would have liked this more."
Elof81,Worse than the anime but still ok?,4/10,27 November 2021,"Soo... the space cowboy bounty-hunter-anime original is one of my absolute favourites of all time, and yes, some parts of this live action remake make me disappointed, some happy.--- Faye Valentine? Why f-ck up a mysterious sexy con-woman into a whining non-funny latino lesbian boss-girl? To please the LGBT community? To ""incluuuuude"" everybody so the europeans wouldn't feel left out? Frikkin Ridiculous, as so many other choices of ""woke Hollywood"". I'm scandinavian and I don'f feel any need whatsoever to change the original characters from asian/black etc.Some of the other castings, Vicious was so-so, the general acting talent in the show was not overwhelming...Episodes from 5-6 and onward is so d-mn cringy as the wokeness shines.++ The general style/feeling of the series is ok, albeit not enough ""anime""-like, but that could be a deliberate choice by the creators.The intro is magic, environments colourful and well taken care of, effects ok (not brilliant). First episodes get ok rating.Verdict: Watchable. Not even close to the original anime."
eluke-72300,"Its great, genuinely fun show",9/10,25 November 2021,"Its awesome! I sincerely don't understand the negative reviews, great characters, action and aesthetic. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am ready for season 2! Adapting any anime into live action is bound to draw out a lot of that nerd rage incel energy from fans of the original but don't let those reviews dissuade you. Its a great fun show.

ShadeOfGreen,"Decent Adaptation, could be better!",8/10,21 November 2021,"This is a decent adaptation of the classic anime Cowboy Bebop, yes I understand that Netflix didn't stay true to the source material and you can see that across the ten episodes. However I don't think it deserves all the hate that it is receiving from critics and viewers.The protagonists Spike (John Cho), Jet Black (Mustafa Shakir). Mustafa really embodies everything in his display of Jet Black, and the suit of Spike is near perfection when compared to the classic.The music was originally composed by Yoko Kanno who originally did the music for the anime, which ties the vast universe of Cowboy Bebop together. Not to mention the visually striking design of the sets, characters, vehicles/spaceships.The show may not be similar to the source material however, it does fall short on the pacing and style. This includes things such as the setting of certain environments and doesn't make effort to convince you that this show is set into the future. Another gripe to have with this show is it's tone and what I mean by this is that classic anime was a lot more gory with the violence, and unsettling however the live adaptation is watered down and that takes a lot away from the story.But the number one issue with this adaption is the lack of chemistry between the characters. John Cho looks bored throughout this show, and shares no chemistry with Mustafa. Julia becomes less complex as the show goes, Vicious doesn't come off as a power hungry character with his ridiculous hair and costume design. It's a shame that they watered down such great and iconic stories, characters and directions of the characters.In saying all this you do see little glimpses of Netflix remaining true to the source material throughout the later episodes. Hopefully with season 2 they improve on the many gripes and issues that fans and critics have becuase Cowboy Bebop deserves better!"
majin_eric,More of a remix,8/10,20 November 2021,"It's not a 1/1 adaptation which is a good thing but it definitely doesn't feel like Bebop it feels like a solid remix of old and new. I say give it a try.

mderossett01,Pale imitation of the real thing!,5/10,21 November 2021,"This show is just enough like the anime to remind you how good the anime was and how far Hollywood has fallen. The cgi is decent but not perfect. 2 of the 3 leads fit their okay except for their ages and the third seems to be trying to hard. The scoring isn't bad. The writing, wow. The writing is horrible especially when remember that all they had to do was watch the anime and copy it. Writing seems to be the number one thing wrong with movies and tv nowadays and this is definitely no different. If you haven't seen the anime then you might really like this show. If you have seen the anime then this will just remind you how good the anime was. 5 out of 10 for the normies!

ihasmax,Better than I expected,10/10,21 November 2021,"As soon as it came out reviewers were trashing it and Twitter was up in arms. I have to say I'm quite impressed with it so far. The acting is very good, and the emotion I felt watching the anime comes through quite well. The casting as well grows on you and you realize they succeeded in casting some very hard roles.It's always going to be hard to adapt an anime to live action and even attempting is going to make a lot of people very angry. If you keep an open mind, don't be too snobby about it, you might find yourself like me having your low expectations wildly exceeded and just happy to be back in that world again with a very well done adaptation of your favorite anime.

wilyz525,"not great, not terrible...",7/10,20 November 2021,"The Cowboy Bebop anime is my favorite anime. And probably one of my favorite TV shows along Firefly, BSG or first seasons of the Expanse where does this fit in??Well, honestly it's nowhere close to the original anime and what was Netflix thinking??? You can't win: you won't be able to recreate the feeling of the original show, you can't live to the expectations (how realistic they are is a different question). That being said however...I quite enjoyed the show! I prefer to think of it as a parallel universe version of the show with so many familiar things and yet with some parts a bit off. The main cast is fine: I truly feel that Jet is straight from the anime while Spike and Fey though substantially different are still enjoyable characters and they create this very similar dynamic when on a hunt for bounties together. Things start falling apart when they are not on the screen however... I could not care less about the backstory of Vicious or Julia - It kind of feels like needless padding for the show.And oh boy, the soundtrack! It's a home run for me - it really helps to create the atmosphere similar to the original anime.So... Would I watch the second season? Yes, definitely!Would I recommend this shows first season? Well yea, but if you saw the anime don't expect it to be a scene-by-scene recreation and more of a remix instead.Will I watch the first season again? I'll probably watch the original anime instead. For now. And maybe after a couple years I will get back to this again..."

One thing that anime fans like about it, it's that usually they ""feel"" different than what you're used to watch, this cowboy bebop adaptation just feels like an average medium budget show that we've seen hundreds of times already.I don't think the actors are totally bad, they're just miscast and the dialogues surely don't help them.

kodaxmax,"It's fun, but feels more like a parody then an adaptation -1st ep spoilers",4/10,29 November 2021,"Compare the first ep of this, to the first ep of the original and you won't need to read this, the problems are obvious.It feels like the writers and director just really didn't ""get"" cowboy bebop and it comes across like a fan made parody. The entire thing being a lazy corporate cash grab sequalizing a beloved anime, which was explicitly anti- that sort of thing aside.The characters fall flat completely missing any of the wit and humor of the original. With spike being more like a goofy dad, than a sly deadpan gunman. You get glimpses of their original characters, but thats all, which isn't helped the absolute mishandling of the plot, which has removed all the.. well plot and replaced it with Hollywood gunfights.Here's some solid examples. In the original spike would often cause collateral damage, generally due to his impatience, benevolent schemes to subtly help people and recklessness. In this adaptation hes shown to be straight up malicious and even enjoying murder and carnage. Spike was rarely so outward, we got to know him through his actions and the contexts of his environments. But in this he practically blurts out what hes thinking like it's some childrens show.Fay valentine went from badass self reliant con artist that always tried to act superior and always got her way, to a pathetic whiny brat, that literally took to begging within her second scene. The original fay would be embarrassed at the new.Jet is actually fairly similar in character to his original, but still feels off, because so much of his character relied the dynamic between the crew on his namesake ship, which he desperately tried to control. He also shares this awkward new malicious streak of spikes, which really rubs against his more sensible traits.The subtle humor and style is all gone. The reveal of the pregnant fugitive that abused Spikes nostalgia for his lost love, being pregnant only with a stash of drugs, in the original was subtle and slightly funny even to spike. In the new it takes place in the middle of a pointless gunfight and elicits no real reaction from spike, who has openly expressed that hes protecting her.In short, it's just worse than the original and doesn't do anything unique. So why watch this when the original is available?"
kittynibblets23,Sorry they cancelled it...,9/10,12 December 2021,"You know, reading comments about the poor effects makes me laugh. I grew up with the original Star Trek and Ultraman and some Gerry Anderson, not to mention 50s/60s B-films that still have 'cult' status. They aren't the worst effects I've ever seen. And I haven't be into anime-type toons since Astro Boy, Speed Racer & Kimba. So I can't make the comparison. But then, I stopped reading comics yonks ago, and I still watch and enjoy Marvel films.I also get the problem with remakes. I cringe over remade films and TV shows on a regular basis.However, after feeling iffy about this series at first, I quickly got into it and was hoping it would return. I loved it! Great characters and acting, real chmistry. Just really FUN.With all the dross that's out there, once again I am dismayed to find that another programme I actually dig bites it.Netflix, sorry you had to act so rashly. C'est la bloody vie."
arielespinal-76499,Nothing like the series.,1/10,4 December 2021,"Why would you change the stories? This was one of the best written anime of it's time, yet the producers decided to do their own twist. Huge disappointment.

toolongse,The sad Truth,10/10,28 January 2022,"...Is that the fans of the original are upset because they no longer feel that they're members of an exclusive club. Salty because the live action has allowed more people to enjoy what they once thought themselves special for having been a part of. A lot like we feel when one of our favorite fantasy books is made in to a tv show or movie and allows the masses to have fun with it without actually putting in the work. And because of that petulant outrage we will not be getting another season. Nerd Alert! Nerd Alert! They won, so enjoy the flawed but entertaining live action for what it is and shake your heads at the 30-40 year olds who are struggling to learn Japanese in their parent's basements.

ajprosise,"Wtf did I watch? Or alternatively, ruining an iconic anime...",2/10,22 November 2021,"Lord, help me through this awful season finale. That is a genuine plea and not just a rhetoric.The sad part is previous episodes were successful, nostalgic, and overall cinematically pleasing. The chemistry of the cast is phenomenal and engaging... if I could separate the review, I'd give them a solid 9.But there's a horrific downfall.The last ten minutes of the season finale concluded with the most generic and overused story arc of all time: Damsel in distress goes power hungry! Julia and Vicious's expanded story added nearly nothing to the dynamic plot. Every time they appeared and opened their mouths, just cringy and predictable garbage came out. I'm not sure if I can stand watching another season of this. Rewatching the anime now to get some decent, albeit depressing, memories back from what this adaption was lacking.Side note: I understand that this wasn't supposed to be a copy/paste of the anime. But if the executives were not going to be mildly true to the source material, why not just create a new show? Could have saved a lot of fans some heartbreak and time."
Rci-739-658932,Does the Impossible,9/10,24 January 2022,"How to translate an Anime masterpiece into live action? Can't be done. No way.The Netflix attempt is *STUNNING* in the effort.First, Anime is limitless in its potential... drawn from a truly blank page, Anime is free to roam in terms of style, story, setting... the sky is the limit.But in the real world with practical photography and practical elements like people, physics, props, and pyrotechnics, the physical becomes a limitation in and of itself... where Anime never needs to look real (it is automatically forgiven that it never is)... the IRL Bebop has the paradoxical requirement of capturing the essence of something that never looks real, while always looking real.Those that rate it harshly aren't coming to grips with this requirement, and would only be satisfied if Netflix redid Bebop as anime... that was frame-by-frame identical.The creators of this fine work obviously focused on being as true as possible to the original from the actual original score to reproducing the opening title sequence perfectly (while introducing photography of the cast).The casting is amazing, with spectacular choices for the core team.While character introduction and storyline are not followed verbatim, the changes are all quite intentional and thoughtful with the exception of Faye being introduced in the first episode... then dismissed entirely for the next 2... the point of which escapes me.Dialog had to up it's game from the original.. hammy dialog from an anime character is accepted... but looks ridiculous coming from a human performer. The writers do a terrific job of this, driving then expanding the character development that feels true to the original.What the creators faced was an impossible challenge... but they succeeded in bringing us much farther than I would have ever imagined.The best Anime to Live Action translation ever achieved. Not to be missed."
mortetm,A pleasant surprise,10/10,22 November 2021,"Cowboy Bebop is a big part of my late teens, and as such I was very excited when I first learned they were making a live-action version. That said, I was almost completely convinced it would be a low-effort Netflix adaptation. Instead we got a fully fleshed-out amazing series, filled with great characters, amazing nods to the original, and incredible visuals. It is more coherent than the original and tells the story in a much better way.The three leads are amazing. I am pretty much pleasantly surprised with the toned down version of Faye, John Cho is amazing as Spike, and Jet looks and talks exactly as I'd imagine him to.The story has been refactored and now it is much easier to follow. Some things are more explicitly stated than in the original and that makes the viewing so much better.The characters are less expressive and do not randomly scream sentences, except for Ed. That said, the last 15 to 30 seconds of the show are barely watchable and Ed needs to go. The character is too annoying to bear.All in all 10/10, except for the last scene, which is 2/10 and that's being generous."

illbock,"A little meh, but overall okay",7/10,21 November 2021,"If you don't compare it to the anime (which you shouldn't), it's a watchable series on its own. It was never intended as a copy of the original, but more like a series based on the story and characters of the anime.However, everything just feels a little off, and that breaks the atmosphere, which was the single best feature of the anime, that's why it only gets a 7.

karissagut,Fails at both staying true to the anime and being original,1/10,20 November 2021,"Another live action series who's existence is best ignored. It's very obvious the show runners don't understand the source material, and why Cowboy Bebop is such a cult classic and loved so deeply throughout the anime community. This series couldn't figure out if it wanted to stay true to the anime or be something completely original and it failed miserably at both. The parts that try to stay true to the anime are done is a such a hollow, rushed, and at times cringey manner, that it loses all the emotional impact that was prevalent in the anime. The parts that stray from the anime are choppy and predictable while simultaneously taking away the heart and themes of the anime, and making everyone feel completely out of character. I did like Vicious though, if you can him that. He was definitely more like Liquid Snake from MGS, but he was so bad he was funny, so I got quite a few good laughs while he was on screen.

eidskrem,I love it!,10/10,4 December 2021,"I cannot really explain it in words. The focus/camera, the music, the colours... my first thought was ""is this a a Tarantino wannabe?"" But no, the self-irony-factor seems even higher. It's a bit goofy, with an ounce of ""Kill Bill""-cool. That they've chosen jazz, combined with laid-back (but desperate) bounty hunters and that everything happens in space, is definitely a new scenario to me. I can see this has only three possible reactions: hate, meh, love.

The setting visuals are absolutely engaging, true-looking and very fresh/ trendy. Humor-action combo seemed in excellent proportion and is really fun and unique. Enjoyed the series very much! Season 2 please! It is a very rare, unique and fun movie series that I personally was missing for many yearsamong heaps of bold but too commercial and typical movies.

purgatorysun,I will give netflix kudos for the effort,4/10,20 November 2021,"Netflix gets kudos for trying to bring.bebop to live action. However I agree that the Casting for the two main characters is way off. First from what I watched in the anime series both spike and Faye should be tall and lean for spike and tall and sexy for Faye. Faye in the series is short and squat does not fit the anime character of lean and sexy. What I did like was the retro and scifi blend and that it has an adult theme to the series. If they do have a season 2 a recast of the main characters should be done. I am sure they can find a tall kean Japanese male leand and a tall lean sexy female lead.

dragonroars-57812,Could have been it's own show.,8/10,15 January 2022,"Although I have watched the anime and read the book, I am not here to compare any of them.The acting was solid and the characters were lovable. The effects and action was awesome. So the question is, why did NetFlix decide to cancel the show? The answer is meta data. They run all their series based on how long they ""survive"" on the top ten list. Apparently it doesn't matter who their competition was upon release. There was only two stinker episodes. Ten was the worst and followed by six. From what I can tell you, the sex scene in #6 was completely unnecessary and there wasn't any action. The prior episodes all came out of the gate strong and six fell flat. It felt like they forced the sex scene in the episode because the rest was a snooze. The last 15 to 20 minutes of the last episode throws everything for a loop and then the writers just ended it. They literally wrote the closure on almost all the open and interesting subplots. Kind of left me wondering if they knew the series was going to be just 10 episodes.I give this a solid 8 and while it did not end the same as the original, I still say, it didn't deserve to be cancelled for bad writers or meta data. NetFlix computers don't predict people thinking, ""That looks interesting, I will watch later when I have the time."". Personally I was too busy and I think I watched the Ryan Reynolds movie that came out around the same time. I still haven't watch season 2 of The Witcher yet. Are they really going to cancel shows based on how fast we view them?Doesn't matter about live action or anime, this could have been it's own show."

lakings97,Much like Killjoys,8/10,2 June 2022,"Cowboy Bebop is the live action series on Netflix based on the anime series. I have never heard of the anime but I got to say I liked it. John Cho as Spike who plays a renegade bounty hunter along with his partner Jet (Mustafa Shakir). This series reminds me of Killjoys from the Syfy channel but set in the style of the 1960's with semi futuristic technology. The guys get hired to hunt down bad guys and work together to try to save the day. Daniella Pineda joins the boys and she falls for a Jade Harlow. Adrienne Barbeau, John Noble, and Geoff Stults have cameos in various episodes. Loved the story, the chase to save the girl but to find she ends up on top controlling the criminal empire. I hope Netflix gives this series another chance, I would love to see where they take the story. Definitely check this out.

renegadeviking-271-528568,Cowboy Bebop review,8/10,4 May 2022,"I don't think that I need to establish the fact that I love Cowboy Bebop. For those of you who have been following me (which is probably only 2 of you in existence), I do like anime. Cowboy Bebop is no exception. It's cool! It's fun! It's influential! So influential that even those who have never seen anime or even watch anime can dig Cowboy Bebop! The characters are so memerable, like Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, Edward, and Vicious being some of anime's greatest characters to ever exist! The universe that this series created is so impressive, imaginative, and fun that it has left an impactful impression as some of the most greatest works of entertainment that ranks up there with many other sci-fi series, along with Star Wars and Star Trek.Now, all the way back in the late 2000s, there was always talk about making a live action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop, but as a movie. I'm sure what happened to that exactly to tell you why that never went anywhere, but I do remember not too many people were impressed of Keanu Reeves playing as Spike, even though he could of easily pulled it off. As for this show, I already had some problems with the trailer, but not too much to not make me be kind of skeptical to watch it. And then I saw the show.I only saw the first episode, and I must say that the production put into this show is impressive! The CGI made this show look great! The colors pops out when it needs to, the care and effort to making the space scenes look awesome is all there, and the sets to replicating the scenes from the anime are best executed in this show. Hell, even the music that they recreated from the anime is here and golden. And I hate Jazz! I just wish I can say the same thing about the writing and directing.Let me be clear to you all, I don't think that this first episode is entirely bad. But I can explain at my personal best of what I find wrong about this show so far. The first problem has to come from the chemistry between both Spike and Jet. These two are always fighting with each other to the point that they sometimes have to wisecrack at each other to remind us that they're best friends. You see here, in the anime, Jet was usually angry and lost his temper, but that was usually coming from other issues that went directly towards him. He did get mad at Spike, but it was rare. Here, they kind of forgot to evenly balanced that out to it makes you kind of wonder it they are friends at all. Feye Valentine, on the other hand, is an issue to the point that I feel like is the worst part. I found this problem at first in the trailer, and it's here in this episode. Feye was usually protrayed as a woman who did have attitude, but more of class. She was kind of the bounty hunter who wanted a luxurious life (like how she did in the past), and joined the team just for the money. That, and she was kind of horny too. Here, she just looks and acts like a woman who just turned into an adult and refuses to grow up. It's distracting and it doesn't work at all. The only character that they got right, so far, is Jet, for the most part. It's just that when he's around with Spike, it just doesn't work. As for Spike, well, john Cho kind of talks like he's about to sleep at times. I know that they're trying to make him act like Spike, but I think they downplayed it a little.The action is okay. I don't have a lot to say about it.The directing is a problem. Yes, Spike did have flashbacks of Julia and the night when he was suppose to die. But he only had those flashbacks when the story needed him to, and when the show had an episode to show them. Vicious came in at about the 10th episode, because it needed to slow down and take it's time to reveal it's antagonist. Plus, the story, as well as the characters, needed to fully develop first to get to him in order to show him. Here, they just showed him on the first episode, and he just looks like a cartoon villain from a Saturday morning cartoon show. And they showed Julia in this too. Same problem there as to what I said about Vicious. Plus, they brought in Feye a little too early and random for me. Her introduction wasn't earned, or at least that's what it felt like for me.Overall, this was kind of a mixed bag for me. I was told that it does get better along the way, but I wasn't that impressed at the start. Usually, that does seem to be the case with most TV shows. The Office (US) had a very rocky start, but it managed to get better as the show progressed as one of the best shows ever made. Now I'm not saying that can happen with this, but I am just saying that I'm hoping it will get better from here."
cameronscriven,Much better than a lot of the reviews,8/10,23 November 2021,"I've really enjoyed this live action adaptation. I'm a huge anime fan, and watched and enjoyed Cowboy Bebop quite a few years ago now.This obviously isn't exactly the same, nor should it be. If you're that desperate for this to be exactly the same, just watch the anime again.This is a fun use of the source material that is respectful to the original. All of the cast do a great job, and I really hope there's a second season before too long.

cmarco-62841,Go in with a blank sheet,10/10,1 December 2021,"I watched the anime as a kid and as an adult and I love it. This takes all of the elements from the anime and honestly made a truly beautiful and artful live action version of it. The anime is drawings that create a truly vibrant world and this did a fantastic job of taking all the key parts and integrating it in a way I really enjoyed from. From Jets family dynamic and background, to the intersecting levels of themes on sex, ambition and living life, in a wild west space adventure. Of course its a dramatic, it came from an anime and that being the case, I went in with a blank slate I didn't want to compare the two because while it's the same ""cast"" and world, totally different people who made it so its not fair to compare it. In my mind go in to view the show not a live copy of the anime.I had a lot of laughs and fun too, gave me kill bill-Quentin Tarantino vibes with the fighting and cut scenes.

jedimstr1971,Netflix finally got it right.,8/10,6 December 2021,"After many tries and disappointments Netflix finally got a live adaptation ofa beloved anime correct. Having been a fan of Bebop since I first saw it on Cartoon Network, I was a bit skeptical at first. This series features all of the important characters from the anime. The plots are a little jumbled, but it works. I am most curious to find out what season two has in store. This is a live action adaptation not to be missed.

And I went to nitpick. Binge it and decide for yourself. Or don't but you're missing out if you're a fan.Fair warning, the first episode is meh. It just is.

nicksmoviereviews,A mixed bag.,5/10,2 December 2021,"Will lovers of the classic anime (myself included) love this version? Probably not. Is the show good? Not really. Was it entertaining? Yes, yes it was. Netflix's live-action version is a mixed bag of good and bad. I liked the actors, including Mustafa as Jet, the problem comes down to writing and direction. Vicious as a character is supposed to be menacing, but he's played for laughs at times. I don't think it's the actor, but it could be the direction and writing. It seems as if the show runner(s) didn't understand what made the show so special, instead doubling-down on spectacle. The cgi is great for the most part, and there's attention to detail in the set design. I only wish the writing was better. I would definitely watch a second season if given the chance, because I was thoroughly entertained despite my gripes. Also, for those complaining about Faye's wardrobe choice, let's be real, her original outfit was absurd form the beginning.

It's anime soul is hidden throughout and the cast shines so bright being faithful to the source material but also somehow making their own. Now if they could just change Vicious' story and make him less of a coward that would be great.

morientkat,Enjoyable reimagining of the anime,10/10,1 December 2021,"Let me start by saying that I love the anime. Loving this anime was my whole identity in high school, so much that I spoke in 3rd person for a month. I am as cringey as they come for Bebop fans and fully expected to drive the hate train when this released.To my surprise, I really enjoyed it. Viewing my favorite anime through another lens was a joy and it felt authentic to the source material while providing interesting new additions.This is not a shot-for-shot remake and it does takes liberties with the story line and characters. But why are so many people upset with that? Surely you've all seen the anime enough times and a live action clone would be stale. Plus, nothing live action could ever truly replicate that magic.If you love the anime and are willing to love something new with a familiar taste, I would say give it a shot! I'm happy that I did."
desertdweller-19447,Outstanding!,10/10,18 January 2022,"My youngest daughter introduced me to the first Cowboy Bebop. So when I got the opportunity to see the the new version I got right on it. I enjoyed it very much the character portrayals were very awesome. I can't be critical of this movie in any way because I know a lot went into the production and I very much enjoyed watching it.

wafles,A Great Japanese Anime refurbish for a modern American audience.,3/10,21 November 2021,"It was made clear to me early on by some of the cast that i was likely not the target audience for this, from the director making the comments about the casting requirements, to the casting itself chiding fans for wanting original type customs. Even if i loved the anime, they made it clear they had to follow a checklist of the modern American culture (gringo culture) but still i had hope, like i still have hope for the One Piece live Action adaptation.But once again Netflix let me down, i had hope for a terrific unexpected adaptation like it happen with the Witcher... but it didn't happen.If you like the original anime and movie, you probably wont like this, but if you are into scify(channel) type series, this is tailor made for you, and i hope you enjoy it, cause i can't.

Watch the original.,1/10,13 December 2021,"No amount of political correctness is going to makeup for taking Gren's story and making him, as someone else so eloquently put it, a ""fierce sassy lgbt bar maid"". A laughable stereotype. Sad when Netflix allows the current narrative to be put before story and trivializes a great character study of a broken soul, warped and cast aside by an uncaring system. If you haven't seen the original, watch it. You'll learn what ""woke"" is really all about.

ben-mckimm,Parody,4/10,20 November 2021,"They're trying so hard to be just like the anime that it feels like a parody. The casting is absolutely awful. John Cho is far too dull as spike, the guy who plays Jet feels like a bad impersonation and the girl who plays Faye has either never seen the original or absolutely does not understand that character at all. It's such an insult that this even carries the same name as the original.I'm really not against remakes/reimaginings but it has to be done right or its pointless. They want this to be exactly the same as the anime rather than being its own thing and they lean so hard into pleasing everyone that it just comes across as corny. It's like a bad joke at the expense of the viewer.The least they could have done was just get the characters right. All they managed to do was cram as many plot points into every episode, as they could and pad it with nice music and special effects. It's a no from me."

balthesaur,"See you, space cowboy!",8/10,13 October 2022,"'Cowboy Bebop', the live adaptation of the legendary anime series of the same name, features John Cho as the charimastic and mysterious Spike Spiegel, Mustafa Shakir as the tough and interesting Jet Black, and Daniella Pineda as the sultry and whimsical Faye Valentine. Through the tragically short-lived series, the crew of the Bebop carry out bounty hunts against the galaxy's most notorious criminal agents.The show is really close to the anime, in terms of cinematography and script. The action sequences, the unique camera angles, musical score, and special effetcs all pay homage to the source material. Even the little nods to the original, such as the Big Shot television show and the appearance of a special fan favorite in the final moments of the series makes this show a memorable piece of nostalgic bliss.Definitely worth a watch!

organdonor347,Broken by Incoherence and Misdirection,2/10,19 November 2021,"This show had some really large boots to fill and it would be disingenuous to say that the creators of the remake didn't try their best to do so but a good story is the sum of its parts and many of them were done poorly or miss the mark completely.The remake has some elements that were well crafted, such as the sets and CGI, and a lot of the casting is well done. Mustafa Shakir, for example, was a good fit for the role of Jet.All of that being said, this show breaks down under a serious lack of coherence. A lot of the characters seem over acted to the point that they are unlikable and are portrayed as cruel caricatures of their original selves. Ed, for example, is simply obnoxious but not in the endearing way they were originally written. In addition, the chemistry between characters is seriously lacking and it comes off more as they are playing roles in close proximity as opposed to acting together to create a vision. This all gives a serious sense that the characters weren't understood very well by the production crew.The original Cowboy Bebop had many comical and lighthearted moments but was driven by a very serious and brooding undertone for Spike and that seems to be lost in this adaption. The performances, writing, and scenes somehow come off as more of a sitcom than serious story telling at times and make the whole experience feel campy and cheap despite its better parts and leave the viewer with the notion that it doesn't need to be taken seriously at any point.Finally, although there are some highlights in the production, the show never seems to be uplifted by the things that were done well and all of the parts never click together to give new life to the source material. The actors get bogged down by each-other and the writing causing the whole affair to seem phoned in. The atmosphere of the show seldom is in sync with the scenes and the action leaves a hollow impression of someone trying to re-create a famous movie fight scene they saw once.This whole affair seems as if it was created by someone who didn't understand the love for the source material but was able to recognize it and capitalize upon it. It's unfortunate that the creators injected this much attention into a project that will only ever invite comparison and serve as a cheap simulacrum of a great story. Do yourself a favor and find another space opera, or better yet, watch the original."
Mandein,TERRIBLE.,2/10,24 November 2021,"Acting was so atrocious and the overall aesthetic simply failed to capture any of the brilliance of the original. But not every show can be a hit. I can only appreciate the attempt but it was a poor one at that.

There's also some truly memorable scenes, and you can tell the makers of this are real sci-fi fans when Jet mentions Tannhauser Gate and the shoulder of Orion. More enjoyable than a lot of other TV shows I've watched recently.

samialej,Great serie!,8/10,27 November 2021,"Loved the anime. This serie has few changes on it but really knows how to tell a story. You really dig in deep and you get to fall in love with every character. Recommended for people who watched the anime and people who want some action and sci-fi in a serie.

I liked the chemistry between the actors and enjoyed the comedy action approach with a melancholic note.Of course it's not the anime, but nevertheless a good take on the subject.

terencetan-42918,Keeps the vibe of anime while doing its own thing,9/10,21 November 2021,"Watched 3 episodes so far and I am very happy with it. Hopefully the show gets another season to grow more legs. The character casting is good, the banter between the leads shows the chemistry and quirky oddness of the anime remains. I almost expect spike or jet to start speaking Japanese which is what I watched it. I am sure fanboys will be happy to tear it apart but what ever happens happens...

john-13959,"After a slow start, very funny and enjoyable",8/10,26 December 2021,"The first episode was pretty mediocre and I very nearly didn't even watch it all the way through. I'm very glad I did though, because the series improved greatly from there on.In short, it's a somewhat absurd, technically nonsensical comedy that reminds me a lot of Killjoys, albeit with more comedy and killing. The main characters get up to a lot of crazy things and somehow never seem to make any money, so are destined to keep trying.This is one of the few recent sci-fi shows that I think are worth watching. In fact it's one of my favourite shows of 2021. Now I just need to wait for what will seem like forever for the next series.

stan-benda,glorious mashup,8/10,26 November 2021,"That is a tasty concoction of film noir, early 60s detective shows (Mannix / Peter Gunn), sci-fi, fantasy and a pinch of jazz minutiae but with a healthy dollop of Quentin Tarantino. Moreover, it is infused with easter eggs; keep an eye out for the street names and box labels. Yes, there are tropes and camp, but they enhance rather than dilute the work.While there is plenty of action there is also plenty of character with the leads.And the sets are delicious. Old IBM computers, original macs, 1950s cars. A feast for the eyes.I took a chance expecting silliness. I got hooked.

jlbryant-31835,"Corny, over the top fun with vibrant music and great cast",10/10,10 December 2021,"I will start by saying I am disappointed that the internet hate mob takes down another series in its infancy before it could hit it's stride. My husband and I are huge fans of the original anime but we intentionally didn't rewatch the anime before jumping into Netflixs take on the space cowboy classic so we could appreciate it for what it was. The sets,costumes, and careful casting were a deliberate love letter to the original. We honestly went in thinking we were going to hate and also that John Cho might not be a believable Spike, boy were we pleasantly surprised. Was it corny ( yes but corny B action done well is my thing), most tv these days takes itself too seriously and has lost the essence of fun and this take was definitely fun. I liked the expansion and reinvention of the characters back stories, especially Faye she felt so much more like a realized character with the live action ( because what the haters won't admit is that the anime did not flesh out all of its plotlines in the way this format can). It seems to be the consensus these days that no adaption from classics is allowed instead we must pump out loveless sequels and drivel to multi million dollar franchises looking at you marvel MCU I'm in such super hero overload that I don't care anymore. So thank you to John Cho, Daniella Pineda, Mustafa and all of the rest of the wonderful cast for providing such a madcap adventure in the bebop, don't listen to the haters. And until next time see you space cowboy . . ."

zanfell,"It's Not Cowboy Bebop, but has it's own charm",4/10,21 November 2021,"I think the show fails to capture the spirit of the original series. That noir-jazz-space cowboy sensation all mixed in one didn't feel the same as in the animated version. Part of that is also likely due to the strange choice of visuals.That being said, the show is pretty enjoyable as a sci-fi. Unfortunately, I think most fans of the original series will be disappointed, and general viewers will see it as hit or miss.I'm still deciding on how to feel about the series, but the best I can say right now is that it feels off. I will say that I'm probably bias because I think Bebop could only work as an anime. I honestly don't see the appeal of making it live-action unless you can really add something new to the style, which the show does not.

sepulvedaeli-74134,10 episodes in - uneven but some good things,6/10,20 November 2021,"Casting for Spike & Jet seems right on the money. Faye, was too abrasive in early episodes. Missing the right mixture of playful & sarcastic that made her character likable. Right now (first couple of episodes), she's just sandpaper. After a few more episodes, she improved tremendously. Vicious was a complete disaster. Supposed to be ""sensually dangerous"", instead he's gross & laughable. A pathetic buffoon. Huge mistake casting that actor. Unfortunately, Vicious, Gren, Julia, are duds. Terrible casting; pathetic acting; atrocious writing. There's no way to save them, they are zeros. Love the visuals, music, atmosphere. Faye has improved, and now on par with Spike & Jet. Too bad we're stuck with this Vicious, perhaps season 2 gets a better one? We can only hope. I can see the animé purists having a hard time with this, but they should still give it a shot. Watched all episodes... Vicious was garbage; Julia was garbage; the ""twist"" was a steaming pile of garbage; Ed was actually worse than Vicious.It has been canceled. Too bad. They didn't get a chance to correct mistakes. If they had, it could have been good."
goolam-dawood,Anime is overrated and real actors inspire,9/10,16 December 2021,"Purists who believe 80's style anime is more than, are really missing the mark. This takes a good original and makes it accessible to grown ups. The styling, the acting, the filmography and the retro thematic transpositions, are better than a cult show like firefly. It makes the original look like a storyboard that 80's anime ultimately was.

bazil-16404,Good fun,9/10,10 December 2021,"I was a big fan of the original back in the day, but I wasn't expecting this to be a straight live action replica of the original. And that's ok, because it was still great fun! The acting is a bit stiff in the first episode, but the actors definitely come into their roles as the season goes on. I actually really like John Cho as spike, I don't understand why that casting is ruffling people's feathers so much. The soundtrack is fantastic, the sets are well done, and the overall vibe is great. I think it does a good job of capturing the cyber punk film noir feel of the original pretty well.I was really looking forward to the second season, and it makes me sad that people can't just enjoy things without these constant comparisons to the original and high expectations for things to be exactly as they were. No live action will ever look or feel exactly like an anime, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. Throw out your expectations and enjoy this for the fun ride it is.

In truth the animation and slightly better. However, this show is excellent in its own right. It's very difficult to translate an animation into a live action film but I think they did a great job. In the live action they modernized many things too. Shame that it was cancelled.

xvmtmmn,I don't understand the hate,9/10,22 November 2021,"I am not an OG Fan but therefore I am free of the nostalgic bias. Even though I am watching the original anime now. That being saidThe first episode is almost a one to one with the anime but I find the live action better. Its a live action that feels over the top and moody and visually jazzy in a way other shows do not. And that is cool. I don't feel it misses the vibe of the Original at all but expand on it.So I don't understand the hate. If the show would have come first and the anime second they would have screamed about the anime it seems. But both are good but the live action is a bit more mature which I like.

m-stanneveld,I love it!,10/10,20 November 2021,"Don't now the original, but wow, I love this! Casting works perfectly for me, and I love the style and feel of it all. The humor is also very nice. It's finally something different than everything else! Great!

uhohhitzphil,Haters ruin everything!!,10/10,13 January 2022,"First off this wasn't going to be a scene for scene reshoot of the anime to live action. So no need to bash it on that aspect. All the actors played their heart for this to come to life. This show deserves a 2nd season and more. It would only get better. Netflix ruins soo many shows due to cancellations. But any who, This show was great, hope it returns.

kodyhicks,A lot of fun! Stop Comparing it.,8/10,3 December 2021,"This show is good and a lot of fun to watch! The characters are awesome and the CGI is really good. Casting IMO is very good. All of the actors/ actresses seem to really know the roles and every character seems their own.All of the negative comments and reviews are from nerds who are obsessed with it needing to be exactly like the anime. Stop doing that. Enjoy it for what it is.

eddiechanty,It's as inventive as a live-action Cowboy Bebop can be.,7/10,27 November 2021,"I can't imagine this is going to end well for many of the die-hard ""fans"" of the anime classic as they'll endlessly trolls the show just for the sake of it. Just ignore those 1/10 or 10/10 reviews.We're at a different time, a different place and a vastly different media culture. Things just can't be the same and being live action there are far more limitations than the anime.There are some rather inventive & colorful sets & clear homage to the OG show's visual & presentation.Plot-wise it's fast-paced yet easy to follow. Nothing groundbreaking though.Main casts' acting are fine.I can see the production tried to put some real effort into every facet of the show. Not a ""cash grab"" type of production that just piggyback on a brand. Respectful of ts OG material with its own spin on things (to adapt to live action).Objectively, it's an entertaining enough watch, though not as memorable as the original (How could it? To be fair...). It's a genre show, you'll like it if you're already into the genre, unlikely be a convert if you never cared for it. Set the right & reasonable expectation and enjoy the fun ride. There aren't many shows like it out there!"
ranma_son,Not a complete copy of the original which makes the watch worth while,8/10,24 November 2021,"I have watched and still love the original Cowboy Bebop which outmatches this version by a fair margin but i personally believe this is a good LIVE ACTION adaptation while having enough changes compared to the original to make the watch worth it.Pro/Con
The series can have a bit of a cheesey vibe to it which works with the nature of the story most the time but there are some times that it's cringe worthy.Con
I personally think they went to far with the 60s style noir where it feels forced down your throat at times, but i do understand why they went in that direction.Pro
While people may dispute it due to cho's age compared to the original Spikes age i think the casting was spot on and it would have been hard finding any one else to fit, i also personally don't think Keanu Reeves would have been any better.Pro/Con
While the series differs from the original which is good, some times they try and keep to the source to much and parts just seem to happen like something was missing just before the scene. This issue shows it self mainly at the end.Con
Some of the small atagonists could have been more fleshed out.Pro
The music."
kurucsaics,Stylish & fun,10/10,21 November 2021,"I enjoyed every second of the story, the picture, the acting, the music. It translated the cartoon in cartoon style. That is way it seems slow but with purpose. So you can enjoy every frame that was planned with care and creativity. I think all the bad review comes from misunderstanding or a wrong expectation. My advuce is just to lay down and enjoy it.

davidhiggins-89756,Quite impressed with the first episode.,8/10,23 October 2022,"Stumbled upon this series, having seen 10 mins of it on an Amazon Fire 4K device. Though it was only at 720p, but looking into it was only actually 480p. SO this time around I decided to get a full 1080p version.Oftentimes you only see these productions the once and at a nice juicy 1080p I though I'd give the entire series a go.Well as said, I'm quite impressed. Some sort of Sci-fi thing going on. All a bit bloody & violent and that, though nothing too disturbing & off putting. Though what was all that tuna fish thing about?, all Japanesy goings on isn't it.The sign of a good series is, Do you want to see another episode of it?. Well yes I do. All a bit of a grungy feel to it, though peppy and snappy as if it is going somewhere. Taking us along for the journey in this World these characters inhabit. Yea it is up my street. I'll give this series a go.Currently seeing box sets of Special Branch series 4, Danger Man series 1, Sledge Hammer series 2. The Commish series 1, though that latter one does feel a bit soppy & unrealistic. And now almost front & centre is this Bebop thing. So far I'm impressed. Worth 8 stars so far."
AUPACK-0085,Just amazing,10/10,21 November 2021,"It's a nice series, I loved it. Looking forward for the second. The light, the casting, the story in each episode is very engaging. If you like martial arts + action + sci-fi, you are gonna like it.

bwihl,Captures playful anime feel while establishing a story that can continue,10/10,24 November 2021,"I can see why many would be unhappy with the life-action remake of a hit anime show. Taking on this task warrants praise alone - many hold Cowboy Bebop sacred. To try to reinvent the show is surely suicide. But reinvention is exactly what the show needed, as it was a victim of its own greatness. Many wanted more than one season of the original show, but that would only deter from the greatness that was the original Bebop. This is new, something different, something that can endure and bring entertainment for many years. It is not the same as the original, and it does not intend to be. It disguises itself as a remake, but is in fact a new take on a classic. And while it does not make that initialy obvious, once it is accepted the viewer can enjoy this ""new"" show for what it is and realize that it has a great first season, establishing the feel of the original, while providing the the groundwork for more seasons: something we all longed for but understood wasn't possible with the original. ""Things aren't beautiful because they last"", but we would like them to. The new Bebop is fun and can last.

salispahic,Casting could have been better,9/10,15 January 2022,"People expect the same thing from Cowboy Bebop anime and Cowboy Bebop live series, and that is silly. Those are two different mediums and they should be treated differently. If you have seen the anime, and you expect the anime, you will be disappointed. It is not an anime, it is SciFi, and a really good SciFi at that. The only bad-ish thing is casting. It could have been better, but it is still good. Watch it.

ktj-61550,What a missed opetunity!,3/10,22 November 2021,"This one hurts, Cowboy Bebob was my first ever Anime and this Live action version destroyed the near perfect story sadly..The first few episodes are really good and sets up the story really well but then it starts to go down hill fast.They don't introduce ED and the end that is supposed to be devastating, is almost laughable in comparison to the true story! The timeline is out of wack and there are some cringe sex scenes that are unnecessary!Fae is also miss cast and portrayed as a lesbian/bi or something like that. It is so cringe that they force that on fans of the original show.This is a huge missed opportunity! The rest of the cast and the series is really well made and you feel engaged in the world. It is also to sort tho and that makes it so the pacing is way off and a lot of the story is missing.I can not recommend this to people i like.."
juanicuesta,It's OK but...,6/10,9 December 2021,"I think the show is ok but John Cho doesn't work for me as Spike. Don't get me wrong, he does a decent job, but not the right cast in my opinion.What I can't stand is his hair. It drove me nuts.

www-afzala1,Watered down from the anime,6/10,28 November 2021,"As the title suggests, it was enjoyable for a netflix show but as an anime adaptation it fails to capture the charm that the anime had like looking more like a comedy than a sci fi noir, combining plots together to make it compact e.g. Vicious hiring Le Fou to kill Spike, Faye getting involved with the couple from ep1, The teddy bomber at the ship etc, thus comes narrative deviations like adding Jet's daughter, making Faye into LGBT, Ein connected to Le Fou's backstory and Julia staying with Vicious. I don't mind if they change the setting and somehow combine two episodes together (although each episode from the anime is it's own thing) but please do NOT change the character's backstory and your own thing, it will not work like adding this woke culture onto Faye by having her make out with a random woman is absolutely disgusting along with doing her dirty by bluntly introducing her in ep1 without any context.On the bright side. I think Mustafa Shakir was hands down was the best choice for Jet, he even sounds like him as well, I'm also fine with Spike (a bit too old), Faye, Julia & Vicious.Is this the worst anime adaptation? No, it wasn't bad at all, I like the OST, action & cinematography, probably waay better than DB: EvolutionIs there room for improvement? Yes, in fact if this show ended with Spike dying and Vicious and Julia winning I would hate this show, but as it stands, there's plenty of story left like Faye's past, Introduction of Ed, Ein's story and Spike's revenge.For now I'll wait and see if season 2 will be better, hopefully introduce references from episodes I haven't seen yet."
snufflepuffpuffpass,"Yes, but can you feel the love?",8/10,22 November 2021,"So I've watched Cowboy Bebop like 10 years ago, give or take a few years.I have also watched A LOT of Live Action content. This adaptation is not a bad one. The cinematography, stage setting, character chemistry, soundtrack, they all feel like a real live adaptation of a world forever locked in comics and cartoons. If you don't like these elements, then you will never enjoy this series. If you fail to see this as fan of the orginal, than you will never enjoy this series. Now... does that make this a bad series or a bad adaptation?... well: as an adaptation, it's not perfection (because that's another topic) but it's pretty dang good; as a series? I don't think it is bad either, but then again I know the original concept in the form of the anime series and movie.Small side note: you guys do realize that there are more than binary ratings here, right? There's like 10 different choices in rating, don't stick to just 2.

vserrol,"Tacky, stupid and totally vapid",4/10,26 November 2021,"When I first read the premise, I thought this might be like The Mandalorian. Space cowboys has been done before and can be as good as the Mandalorian. On the other hand it could be like this. I watched 3 episodes and saw nothing that might indicate an actual plot or story line at the bare minimum. Just one mindlessly violent scene after the other. Once you get it that these guys have continuous bad luck with love and money, are clueless, but will nevertheless win all their pointless fights, you can safely stop watching, knowing that you will miss nothing of substance.

spideyballs,Wow.,1/10,20 November 2021,"THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THIS SHOW WAS EINI went into watching this with an open mind. I read all of the bad reviews and told myself that I was not going to take it too seriously, I thought it would just be fun to see one of my all time favorite anime in live action and just wanted to try and enjoy it for what it was. I was so wrong.. I got more and more annoyed with each episode, I feel like they did the characters dirty and changed their personalities way too much. Why does Jet have a daughter? Why is Faye a lesbian? Why is spike so old, ugly and short? WHY NETFLIX WHY?"
dominiclearwood,Not bad but origional is best,6/10,18 December 2021,"Well I didnt expect much of any live action adaptation of an animé or similar, but this was pretty good. There were some comments on the casting however I think they lived up to their roles. I really like how Faye valentine is portrayed she certainly has that bad ass bounty hunter vibe in a way that you'd expect. I like that they've taken some liberties with the characterisation like with Faye Vallentine and also given Ana more of a role instead of juat being the liquor store owner."
bosskardo,Horrible dialogue,5/10,30 November 2021,"I just can't stand the dialogue. It's so awkward how information is introduced.Even small talk feels so scripted.Tech is worse than the anime, space tech mixed with tech too old so it's not even funny.

rangrnav,Not bad,8/10,12 December 2021,"I enjoyed the new Cowboy Bebop. John Cho did a respectable job as Spike, and Mustafa Shakir absolutely nailed the Jet Black character. They could have done a better job casting Faye Valentine, as Daniella Pineda's portrayal was rather off-putting. One of the most memorable baddies from the anime is so bombastic and bonkers, I wondered if they'd even be able to pull him off, but they did so rather well. The vehicles and various other set pieces were true to the anime, making it feel like the show creators really put some love into it. An anime to live-action adaptation is a tough thing to pull off, but I feel like they captured the spirit and aesthetic of the original, and did about as well as one could expect. Compared to an absolute abortion like Dragonball: Evolution, this comes out looking like a smashing success. I'm rather disappointed that there won't be another season. Where they left off was ripe with potential for some interesting developments, and the last second appearance of one of the most beloved characters left me wanting more. Oh well. Hopefully Netflix will change its mind and renew the show.

tonygarner-75970,Outstanding.,10/10,24 November 2021,"I can't find anything to say that's negative about this show.It's slick, nuanced and very well produced. The three main characters act sublimely well.This is sophisticated sci-fi. I recommend you watch it end to end.I didn't binge it. For me, this is high recommendation;I cannot bear the thought of it being over.Like reading Asimov?Like Blade runner?Like noir detective thrillers ?Watch this.Enjoy!"
tpotwinnow,It tries hard but doesn't quite make it,6/10,23 November 2021,"Kudos to the wardrobe and set designers because the clothes and the settings are chef's kiss perfect. The story and casting ...well. John Cho, Mustafa Shakir, and Daniella Pineda are nearly perfect as Spike, Jet, and Faye (with Pineda doing the best job of the 3). They were soooo close. I don't know what happened when they got to casting Vicious. It's a hackneyed, ham-fisted temper tantrum of a performance. There's none of the cold, calculating, blue-flame hate and rage of the character from the anime. What a missed opportunity.I'm not going to comment much on the cameo at the end because Netflix still has time to fix that (Dear Netflix, you NEED to fix that.) But they really can't undo the mess they made of the story. There's too much of Jet's kid, not enough of Spike eating, way too little Ein, and Faye's backstory is wtf from beginning to end. Vicious isn't scary at all and Julia makes you hate her. Why they did what they did to Gren is a complete mystery to me. I like the new version - that's a fierce a$$ queen, yes - but he ain't our fave sax player. He and Faye interact for a literal 15 seconds in the whole season. Another missed opportunity.I wasn't expecting it to be the anime frame by frame, but it would have been nice to see some of those episodes played out instead sliced and diced into this weird narrative. There's a little Hakim here, a little Asimov there, a casino for a bit... None of it really ever pulls together, it never feels cohesive.Is it watchable? Yes. Especially if you've never seen the anime or read the manga. But when someone - who was so excited about this adaptation that they actually broke a blood vessel in their eye after hearing about it - falls asleep several times while trying to watch it? That's not a good sign.Not sure I'll stick around for season 2. I might just go rewatch the anime and read the manga instead."
edjofsanity,Could have been excellent and I hope to see more.,6/10,29 November 2021,"I love the original Cowboy Bebop anime. The style, the music, and the story was fantastic. This live action rendition was very well done, capturing a lot of the fun of the anime. However, it did have two huge flaws that kept its rating lower than should be. The first, and biggest, were the backstories. The backstories slow down the program. They were tedious, and uninteresting, and added nothing good to the program. Sticking with the bounty hunter aspect would've brought the shows rating up to a nine. If this show gets a second season it should be much better now that the backstory is out of the way. The only other thing that could've been improved was the language. The original Anime was for PG viewers. Including all the extra foul language only serves to dumb the showdown and keep me from letting my kids watch. I hope the writers I think this through if there's a second season.All in all it's worth a watch, you just might want to keep the fast forward button handy for the slow backstory parts."
ffadityawahyudi,Need more action I was boring at the end,5/10,9 December 2021,"I love cowboy bebop but, the adaptation is not bad enough, my expectations are more action like the first episode but last I felt boring as well.More action and more comedy I wish.

melvin_ebron,Not as bad as I expected,7/10,21 November 2021,"To start off, it would be a monumental feat to capture the vibe, story and characters of this masterpiece of an anime to a live action adaptation.Starting with the pros:
-Spike and Jet's chemistry seems just right in the live action.-The setting which is sci-fi outer space futuristic post Earth; also not bad visually and production wise
-Action scenes are still entertaining
-Most dialogue has been updated and feels okCons:-They should have kept the mystery of Vicious and Julia, even if they slightly changed the plot around these two. I mean less but impactful exposure.I felt he result was the loss of Vicious' sense of dread when he is present in the scenes.-Lost symbolisms of the original. The prevailing theme here should be existentialism, and how everyone is prisoner of the past.I will update this upon completion of the series."
xing-32254,Fight cinematography ruins it,6/10,25 November 2021,"The martial arts combat was golden in the animated series. The poor fighting/stunt work in this made an otherwise workable show ridiculous, not in the good way.

joaomiguelsl1982,Good not excellent,8/10,23 November 2021,"I understand what they where doing, is it bad? No. Is it excellent? No, but it's good, they keep close to the source material, it's never easy to adapt anime to real action. But I enjoyed the series, I think the cast is very good, yes jet is not exactly the same but so what? It went pretty well, Spike to me is very good and Faye looks amazing. The essence is there, they stick to the anime story and all in all it's a good time in front of the tv. The big no for me is vicious, the villain, not that good. And the sound track is just has good has ever.

fuzzysfrodis-12994,"The More I Watched, The Worse It Got.",2/10,24 November 2021,"I was a huge fan of Cowboy Bebop back in 2002. I cried at the end of it. When I heard that Netflix was bring the anime to life, I had my doubts. The first episode brought in a lot of episode one and the beginning of the animes original movie. No creativity, except to change the locations. As I continued to watch the more I grew to completely dislike it. The original will always be so much better than the first. Netflix, you should have left the series alone."
ttbloodlusttt-50085,This is great!,10/10,4 December 2021,"I fell in love with the anime many years ago. I love the aesthetic and the actors in this live-action adaption!I would call myself a die hard fan of the anime. I feel that some fans will not understand some of the choices that were made, particularly with condensing or rearranging some events. I do think an open mind and anticipating a fresh start is in order. I particularly enjoy some of the anime's glaring plot hold being filled in.There's something special about this and it's allowed to not take itself too seriously, which in many ways makes it even better.

d_boekkooi,its fun to watch!,9/10,21 November 2021,"I didn't expect much from this but it was certainly more enjoyable than i anticipated. I've watched the anime when i was young, thought it's not the same, it still does a good job. If you didn't watch the anime you are going to have a fun time! People that are complaining and comparing it with the anime, just let it go. It's a solid show on it's own with a lot of enjoyable moments that do remind you of the good old days. I would have rated it higher, but the lips of the character Julia (Elena Satine) are not pleasant to look at.

Bader_Muhammad,Good in most things except the most important,5/10,3 June 2023,"TLDR:
Plot and dialogue are either mediocre or diabolically bad.Characters are barely the same with some having their personalities and behaviours almost entirely rewritten.Some scenes are really well directed and others not.The cinematography and soundtrack are perfect.The SFX are usually pretty good but sometimes bad.The show could've been a really good adaptation if the writers managed to do a better job. Everything else was either satisfactory or really good.Writing:
The original storylines didn't have to be fleshed out at all. Instead, they could've adapted the original storylines exactly as they were and then added in a few new stories or fleshed out the overall plot by adding more backstory episodes and whatnot. Most of the original show would be considered filler as they were unrelated to the overall plot so that made the episode story possibilities endless.Regarding the main plot, it's pretty meh. Entire dynamics were rewritten. Entire personalities were rewritten. It doesn't compare to the original main plot. There's a lot of extra drama and a massive lack of realism as well. The main antagonist is just a psycho man baby compared to the calm and calculative manipulator in the orignal. It's pretty disappointing to see people turn a really good story into something mediocre.The dialogue is so bad sometimes it hurts to watch. I have probably skipped through some sequences because of how cringeworthy they were. Also, they poured in wayyy too many sexual jokes into this adaptation and almost none of them were funny.I will say though that some scenes are just perfectly written and genuinely make me smile because of how they remind me of the original. A scene I keep in mind is when Jet is at his daughters performance and Spike is fighting a bunch of goons in the background. There are other things too but it doesn't matter, the point is that most of the writing is incredibly mediocre and has watered down or completely demolished what used to be a very well-written storyline.Characters:
As stated earlier, the characters don't feel the same for the most part. The only character that reminds me of the original is Jet but even then he has some very questionable moments for his character. Most of the other characters are just questionable all the time with some parts that remind me of the orignal. The main antagonist got the worst of it. Once again, he went from badass Bond movie villain to a weird man baby that has overexaggerated facial expressions. Some fo the acting also feels very forced and unnatural, both for the characters, actors and the situation in general. I understand it's incredibly difficult to capture the personalities of these characters as they're very complex and translating the dynamic is probably easier said than done but this was a bit too bad in my opinion. It felt like I was watching a sitcom at times.Cinematography, OST and SFX:
These 3 were actually perfect most of the time. Sometimes the SFX felt a bit underwhelming or clunky but for the most part, it was really good.The cinematography was amazing with some amazing camera work and angles as well. This is probably the best part of the show but unfortunately, doesn't really make up for the other faults.Soundtrack is perfect. Can't expect less considering it's literally composed by the same person that composed the original show's soundtrack.As you can see the show is pretty much a tasteless cake with the best icing and cherries on top. I don't know where these writers come from and why big companies keep hiring them but it's disappointing to see so many projects wasting away because of bad writers."
melcher-2001,If David Lynch Directed 'Kung Fu Hustle',9/10,8 April 2022,"The most visually imaginative and stylistically engaging series I've seen since 'Wandavision'. John Cho and Mustafa Shakir are the perfect 'buddy' team and things really gel with the excellent comic performance of Daniella Pineda. The whole cast is excellent, pirouetting between dramatic intensity and over-the-top action and comedy that borrows from every noir genre, sci-fi epic and music video, then pumps it up past the ridiculous to absolutely delightful eye candy. Kudos to Christopher Yost and Director Garcia Lopez for taking the chance, removing all the stops and making it work.

daemn42,"Enjoyed about 70% of it, but where could it have possibly gone from here?",7/10,13 December 2021,"Artistically I really liked the show. The live action was mixed with CG seamlessly and the film noir vibe carried throughout. I'd watch more of this style.On to the story..
I listened to the prequel audio book ""Cowboy Bebop: A Syndicate Story"" (which I enjoyed), before watching the show, and I think it really helped add context and explain why Viscous feels so utterly betrayed by Fearless (beyond the love triangle introduced in this show), and how it could turn so dark. But maybe it went too far.I really enjoyed the original Cowboy Bebop (in my top 3 animated series), where we always knew the characters had complicated but hidden back stories, and they masked their pain with irony and humor. There was a little arc of mystery as they pulled on some of these threads, but it didn't prevent it from remaining light hearted in an ironic way. This adaptation had that feel for about 6-7 out of ten episodes. My gripes within those episodes. I felt that Spike's character was almost useless at times, where he came across as a lot more confident and competent in the original. The crew are apparently entirely incapable of ever capturing any bounty alive (how do they survive at all?). And the tag lines at the end of the episode often felt disconnected, where in the original show they either made me laugh, or my heart ache a little.Just when I was settling into the new vibe, this show went full on DARK. Viscous and Fearless's backstory plays out, in an unexpected and not very satisfying direction. Ultimately I just don't know that I *wanted* to know how utterly screwed or screwed up everyone is, and they made me not like Julia (expected) and Spike (unexpected). In the end I don't see how there can be any story left to tell between Jet and Spike. How would you repair that much damage? Given that the show was cancelled, maybe that's the answer. It can't.I enjoyed most of what I watched, but I'm disappointed that there won't be any more Cowboy Bebop, because the writer's wrote it into a box canyon from which there is no escape."

kyledavidashforth,A different lens,8/10,21 November 2021,"I loved the anime, this is different from that sure, it would be boring if it wasn't. No it isn't perfect but it's not 1 star bad, that's like a movie where you can still see the wires or the crew that made it in the shot. Be fair with the reviews air your dislikes so that they can iron them out in the next season. How can they get it right it they don't get a chance.

schumacher-06114,The world is full of outrage merchants,9/10,10 December 2021,"Honestly guys, your just peddlers.Maybe we should just chill out for a second? Yeah, nothing will ever replace the original anime, that's a fact, and I agree.But to say this is inherently bad, or John Cho is poorly cast, or that he has done a bad job, is absolutely ludicrous.I love the anime, and I love this. Let's just for a second try and not be silly and just enjoy the content. Far out. The Internet literally consists of nothing but trolls these days. Yeah it's not the best thing that has been produced, but it's far from it.Please make more, don't listen to the nonsense.

eplunk-14841,I'm glad it's here,8/10,21 November 2021,"I'm immersed in this world, currently half-way through the season. At first I thought it was too campy, but it's no more campy than any Farscape episode or JJ Abrams Star Wars movie.The anime is still #1, but here is something I like about the live-action version ... I can follow the nuances of the stories much easier/better. The live-action episodes have twice the runtime of the anime series. This helps each story be told.I have one Cowboy Bebop CD, and this show convinced me I need a few more. :)

crystian5466,It has an original style that fits the original tone of the show,8/10,20 November 2021,"The show get's some hate due to the original fans wanting the show to be a complete copy and paste and not give a chance for a new unique spin on the original show people love. However, it's a very well stylized show that does a fantastic job at cinematography to portray an original show. I know some of the continuity of the show doesn't match the original, but that's because it wasn't meant to be a copy and paste from the original. It's meant to be a new show that has it's own style and feel, that still connects new fans and older fans of the original. Overall, a very good show, that has a lot to offer.

ngof-01761,Episode 1 to none,2/10,25 November 2021,"The first episode was spectacular, I was prepared for disappoint and truly surprised. After the first 3 episodes the quirky camera shots of the anime and amazing atmosphere and music was replaced with storylines you won't care about and terrible acting. Jett is the only redeeming character by episode 6 who still feels like a cowboy Bebop character. Spike doesn't really get to shine like he does in the anime. I couldn't even finish episode 7 and had to stop watching, the acting was repulsive.

They have taken an anime with questionable plot and given it the depth of deserves. Very few anime adaptations have been good, specially ones going for a TV show versus a movie.Highly recommend!

I can't believe it got cancelled. Eh. Just goes to show we are all held prisoners by cancel culture.

moviegoingguywhoknowsstuffmaybe,A great adaptation of a classic anime.,10/10,22 November 2021,"As a Cowboy Bebop fan, I was not expecting much from this show, but it totally blew me away. From the start of the opening scene through to the end of the title credits my expectations shot from zero to one hundred, and for the 10 episodes that followed - it never disappointed me once. I've watched it twice through, (with a huge smile on my face) and no doubt I'll be doing a third run soon.The key for me was the music, in a word: TANK! The fact that we got new tracks from Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts makes the whole thing worth it. They also managed to fit a lot of the original score into the show and as fans will tell you, it was the music (as well as great character design, storytelling and animation / direction) that made the original such a hit.The casting and acting was good too, especially the comedic moments between Faye, Spike and Jet, the writers & actors absolutely nailed that dynamic, and I just want to thank the costume designers for sorting out Faye with a proper costume, rather than have her run around half naked the whole time - although fans of the original will also have recognised Ms Valentine's red opera dress.People have criticised the leads, but for me all three (Spike, Jet and especially Faye) were perfectly cast and acted the roles well, same for the rest of the cast: Julia, Ana, - I love what they did with Gren's character, and Mao Yenrai - and yes, even Vicious), and the other supporting roles were perfect too like Pierrot Le Fou, Udai Taxim, Syndicate members, the whole ensemble.The direction is fantastic, every trick in the book was used and a lot of it was also pretty experimental, and it all worked very well when it came to riffing off of the anime, and keeping the original feel in the new show. The shot selection and camera movement / direction felt like an anime more than a live action show at times (and not just for the shot-for-shot ""highlights"" they dotted through the show), which is hard to pull off. Then there are the sets! The beautiful sets! Ana's bar and Vicious and Julia's apartment as well as the Bebop all look great. The CGI goes from 'great' through to ""good enough"" but overall works well.Finally, the story. I absolutely love what they did. If you have never seen Cowboy Bebop before the story they tell in this TV show hangs together on its own terms, and if you are a fan of the original it genuinely felt like watching something new, but also something absolutely rooted in the original universe in terms of both characters and events. (Oh and the music!)TLDR: I cannot recommend this highly enough, if you have never seen the anime, just jump right in, you don't need it. If you are a fan of the original show, be prepared to see some new stuff, and some old stuff, but all of it good stuff.One word review: TANK!(Please, for the love of all that is holy, a second season must be green lit - if only to make another recording session with The Seatbelts happen, and just imagine Vincent with his butterflies. I mean how timely is that storyline! Come on Netflix, it's a no brainer.)"
stevegroundhog,I love it!,10/10,22 November 2021,"Stop being a purist, they kept the old format, and I absolutely love it! More in depth character development, with everyone except the obvious. Where is Ed? Will he show up season 2. (DON'T CANCEL THE SHOW) I want to see more.

SteveFOX_86,Missed opportunity to improved on a flawed by cool Anime,6/10,6 December 2021,"I wouldn't say I'm a huge fan of Anime or especially Cowboy Bebop, but I have seen it twice over the years, and find it cool, but not without flaws.Hearing they were going to do a live TV series got me excited, not for wanting a 1:1 remake, but for seeing that there was things which could be improved in the original anime, like the pacing, some dry episodes and fleshing out some of the characters more.Watching the first few episodes of the new TV series, got me excited as it was going great, some things were changed and it was going to be smaller in scale (which was expected due to the budget concerns), but after episode 3 it kinda fell apart for me.Casting was great in Spike and Jet but meh to poor on the rest of the main characters in Faye, Julia and Vicious. Especially Julia and Vicious look way more cartoonish and cardboard then in the anime!The re-written lines and scenes from the original after episode 3 felt forced and just not interesting, that is not to say the original anime didn't have dull and forced moments, but here instead of making them better, they somehow made them worse.I applaud the directing style and the two leads cast, hence why I give it a 6, but the rest is just not well done at all.See you later Netflix cowboys."
roeschfranz,I get why there are so many negative reviews...,8/10,20 November 2021,"... but you won't necessarily regret giving it a chance.Watching the first episode i was shocked. I hated the acting, I despised the the costumes and sets, the acting was hideous. It all felt so cheap, it could have been a 'The Asylum'-mockery.And to make matters even worse it seemed like the producers wanted to make an exact copy of the original anime - same setting, same dialogues, same effing camera angles - garnished with some obligatory diversity and some ever so slight changes.I was SO close to stop watching halfway through the first episode.But i had nothing better to do and stuck to it - as a background noise for my studies. And suddenly, 3 episodes in, i noticed i wasn't studying anymore. The series had my attention. Wholeheartedly.That first episode is just dumb and will cost the series many viewers. But the series develops in it's own direction and after a while it get's deeper, makes some nice additions to the original and setting, acting and the general style begin to make sense.Despite the sluggish beginning i really grew onto the show and can with absolute confidence rate it as an 8/10. The current rating of 6.3 underrates the series massively.Again. Give it a chance."

highisophotography,Disappointing for fans,3/10,20 November 2021,"I am going to warn of spoilers here, but I will talk about the good first... I binged the whole series hoping it would find roots and reconnect with the original anime and ended up completely devastated.FIRST, let's address the short list of good things in this anime. Special effects wise- I found this a blast! The rendering of the Bebop, Swordfish, and Red Tail were well crafted and had a beautiful callback to the ""old school"" tech of the anime. Referring to the display screens, color, and interiors. I will give credit where it is due and visually I found this very enjoyable- even the wardrobe (while a little flat to still give homage to the anime) was well made and utilized.****************SPOILERS***************Now the long list of the absolute terrible, which was prevalent throughout this series.I was not expecting a copy/paste of the original series, but I had really hoped there would be more of the original story in the series. So let's address each character from terrible to worse.Vicious: (Alex Hassell) absolutely absurd casting choice and even WORSE was his dialogue and portrayal of the syndicates would be top assassin. While his role in the anime is restricted to Spike's mysterious rival and antagonist- he plays a keen role in reminding us and Spike throughout the series that you can't escape your past. Eventually it all catches up to you in the end and all we can do is face it. Writers decided that instead of wrapping Vicious in a cloak of mystery, intelligence, and fear they would make him into a syndicate 'lieutenant' with rage problems and a daddy complex.This was really a devastating blow to all learn by episode 2! In the anime it is Vicious' lack of character development that makes him the frightening figure he is. His backstory, his place in the syndicate, and his life do not matter- he is simply the embodiment of his name ""Vicious"" and nothing more... now he's a just another villain that writers want me to care about... it didn't work for Darth Vader and it simply failed utterly here.Julia: (Elena Satine) this was a better casted character... but as with Vicious- Julia was to remain elusive and spectral. She is the part of Spike's past he can't let go of and it is because of her that he can't run. It is because of her that he is stuck and stagnant. In the anime it is insinuated through flashbacks that there may have been some kind of love triangle between Vicious, Spike and Julia... which I find a stretch personally. I think that Julia simply woke Spike up and made him realize that his life wasn't his own and he deserved more... but that's another debate.Bluntly put, writers decided that expanding Vicious character meant it was time to give Julia a greater role and now she plays a HUGE role as Vicious' wife, and the syndicates ""successor..."" I won't tell you how, I will just tell you that I have never audibly groaned louder ever before. Seeing her go from the good natured character she was intended to be to full on Frodo Baggins at Mount Doom was a devastating blow to myself as a fan and the series as a whole.Jet Black: (Mustafa Shakir) next to Spike himself, Jet was one of the most developed characters in the original anime. His development in the series was direct foreshadowing of what Spike would soon have to confront and served as a sort of ""moral compass"" for character growth and stability. While he may be reckless at times his ability to rise above his past and live in the present is what makes him such a strong supporting character for Spike. He blazes the trail that Spike must follow, but Spike simply can't. His sins are great, atonement and sacrifice are the only thing that free him in the end.Live-Action Jet is a struggling divorced dad who is trying to reconnect with his daughter while simultaneously trying to make a new replacement family with Spike and Fay. He is overly sensitive, dumb, and realistically... a pansy. He lets Spike walk all over him instead of holding him accountable and is constantly portrayed as the dad who's trying, but still never there for his kid.I do admire the boldness of trying to give more depth and angle to the character... but he was so strong before, the rewrite just weakened him.Faye Valentine: (Daniella Pineda) casting wise, was not upset. She's still sexy, but no longer sexualized and a stronger more independent feminine character. In the original series Faye is the character without a past, forgotten, but left with enormous debt. In the series she is running to her past in order to piece together what she's lost and regain a family, a life, and a meaning. While the live action holds true to her being in cryosleep, it completely falters in creating a character who is unstable in the present, self serving, and manipulative.Once again- the writers believed that in order to create a strong female role they must show a woman who is in complete control of herself, her emotions, and can do ""anything the boys can do."" However, instead of following the path already set and making a tough, scrappy woman who can take care of herself and doesn't rely on others. Faye becomes completely dependent on the boys for stability and support. Simply put, she is the Bebop's new cool step mom and is reduced to little more than a supporting character with a predictively weak narrative.Spike Spiegel: (John Cho) unpopular opinion, I liked this casting pick. John plays laid back and serious spike so well- I really don't have complaints.Spike is the one character that remains essentially the same. So it's hard to do little more than nitpick little things about him that realistically- matter little to me. His character is weakened by the redevelopment of supporting characters around him, but he's still level headed, laid back, and a smart ass.Radical Ed: (Eden Perkins) Ed is only at the bottom of the list because her introduction is only like 30 seconds at the very end of the season... but I hate her already. There is a difference between playing an immature adolescent super genius and whatever the hell that portrayal was. I'm just plain upset.Anyways, for anyone that made it to the bottom of my essay, you truly are a devoted Bebop fan like myself. Pretend the live action doesn't exist and watch the original a couple times in a row... just to be safe."
wyattsgirlproblems,Every franchise I know and love will eventually burn up in flames,2/10,19 November 2021,"Cowboy Bebop (2021) is a remake of Cowboy Bebop (1997), and not a good one. All of the ""changes"" in this show to the original are worse, and this show doesn't even change much anyways. Everything that is added is kinda bad and boring. This show doesn't do anything to stand on its own and relies very heavily on the far superior amine. I liked some of the music choices, but that's about it.

the_brain888,Gorgeous visually and audially. Keeps the same feel of the classic anime,9/10,9 January 2022,"With an adaption, there will always be the purists who will decry every minor alteration and the realists that except that the change in medium (and audience) necessitates some changes.Firstly the characters. Spike and Jet have the same feel. Spike is the brash cowboy, quick on his heels just like in the anime. He's more martial artsy in this one, but it works. Jet is now black, which some have commented on but I think works.Faye Valentine, I can see the purists being up in arms. However, I don't think the Faye from the anime (which was released in 1998 mind you) really works both for an American audience and in 2021. Anime Faye was the stereotypical anime femme fatal. A walking pair of boobs and long legs. Sporting the yellow short shorts, low cut tank top, and red shawl always just on her arm but never covering her breasts. Someone who uses her feminine wiles to her advantage type of anime trope. I really don't think that Faye Valentine would work. Not with a Netflix audience and not in 2021. I wanted a smarter more subversive stereotype.However, I'm not really sure this angry 90's style Girl-Power Michelle-Rodriguez stereotype Faye works either. So... I don't know. This was really the only miss for me.Vicious is a little cartoony villainous, but the source material is a little limiting. There is a reason he only popped up sparingly in the anime.I had some hope Ed would pop up, but that character just doesn't work in live action.Now for the visuals. They are gorgeous. They are far richer than the anime and many of them is just straight up lifted from the original. Those are a thrill to watch.The music choices match. The name of the show is cowboy bebop. You can't have bebop in the name and not expect some great jazz, and it delivered.I appreciate some fan service with some plot points lifted straight from episodes. The red eye couple from live action Ep1 for example is straight up from anime Ep1. Great fan service.It helps to have seen the anime directly before this version. Thank you Netflix for acquiring the anime and movie. For me the nostalgia from having seen the anime almost 20 years ago had built it up to more than it was. Seeing the anime now really let me see the flaws (i.e. The walking female anime trope stereotype in Faye Valentine) and gave me a different perspective in expectation of this version.It's a darn shame that Netflix axed it. It could have been a great run."
heydude-55977,They didn't get the reference .,2/10,20 November 2021,"So I've tried to watch the first 10 minute and it was unbearable. It had that super slow pace, and awkward feel to it. I think they could've done better, if they experimented a little more, maybe? And didn't took all the reference THAT literal. You don't have to do the same thing as the anime, you could never do that. They didn't catch up to the flow and concept that the anime has.Cowboy bebop fans aren't mad or resented, this was pretty disappointing at the end. Nobody asked for perfection, just for putting a little more thought to important details and a coherent representation of the essence of the show.

ramzymatoug,Faye ruins the show.,3/10,21 November 2021,"Spike and Jet are done well, but they COMPLETELY changed Faye. She's now a lesbian, a tomboy and curses like a sailor. They changed her first love interest (Whitney Haggis Matsumoto) into a woman who instead pretended to be her mother. It's just all bad, and don't even get me started on how badly they ruined Vicious and Julia.

dargo888,A Watchable Alternate Universe,6/10,8 December 2021,"That is the best mindset to approach this with if you have watched the anime. The storyline is remade, condensed, and told in a different order and direction. The characters portrayed here have little resemblance to their anime counterparts, while not terrible it's not true to the anime. Overall it's watchable, definitely better than the other piles of crap that were live-action anime movies, which is saying a lot.

solarmus-71884,A fun homage/modern adaptation of the classic anime,8/10,20 November 2021,"It's fun, it's stylish and it has the heart of the original in mind, overall a good homage to the original while updating to a modern, a bit more western format. Are there flaws? Sure. Some of the banter doesn't quite fit smoothly and some of the lines are a bit wooden early on. This does seem to improve as the actors get a little more comfortable with their character's skins.Overall, it's not revolutionary or exceptional, but it is fun and if you liked the original, you should sit back and just enjoy it.

matexunleashed,Nostalgia train which was doomed to derail,5/10,21 November 2021,"It does have a certain charm to it, at moments it's somewhat enjoyable to watch. But at the same time it fails to build emotions that the original did, it also doesn't build such strong bond to the characters. In the original I truly cared and was invested in Spike's tragic love and betrayal story or Faye's search of lost identity. Here it kinda falls flat. Also I feel that they didn't get the characters right, I mean Spike was more reckless, melancholic and I would say, fatalistic at times. They did a little better job with Faye, but still I think she was more unpredictable and in a way lost. The whole arc with Vicious also falls short of the previous installment. It definitely felt more grand in the original, more tense, Vicious was this ghoul like angel of death. The choice of the actors is not that bad, of course they barely have any resemblance to the original but still, it's not the main problem with this series. Fights or visuals are, well okeish. Maybe the budget wasn't enough to do it on higher level. They took and incredibly hard task, to remake a near perfection one of the best animes ever. The failure was imminent but I feel that really they could fail less. So overall, for someone who loved the original Cowboy Bebop, this one is riding on nostalgia hard and it's probably it's main strength, otherwise it quite average netflix mass product, unoriginal, safe bet to grab some coins milking someone else past grand achivements."

silvergeordie,Better than expected.,8/10,20 November 2021,"I expected this to be garbage, I was disappointed by Fay's cowardly costume change and wrapping her up like she belongs to certain religious cult ashamed to be a woman. That aside, the show was far better than I expected, Mustafa Shakir plays an epic rendition of Jet Black, looks like the original, is as serious as the original, I suspect Mustafa was a big fan of Cowboy Bebop. John Cho as Spike was a decent decision but the plot so far hasn't really shown him to be as cool and calm under pressure as the original. That said, the plots are new mixed in with some original story plots rather seamlessly. Finally, a little spoiler, Radical Edward is finally here, a few seconds hint for what is to come and the young actress does not let fans down, the voice is adorably annoying, a great job in copying the original version gave me goosebumps for next season."
jpross-95920,Viscious is awful,2/10,20 November 2021,"Spike and Jet are perfect. The music is perfect. Faye is great. Viscious and Julia in this remake are terrible. Absolutely terrible. They completely remade those two characters, and it's awful. The shoe is great except for them. I hope someone on reddit is making a super with all the viscious and Julia scenes cut out, or maybe replaced with the original scenes with viscious.

Is it exactly the same as the source material? No, but I'd argue it's something better: something that stands on its own as a new story and plays to the strengths of its actors and writers.

rabidartist-02024,"Not perfect, but a damn good time",9/10,26 November 2021,"I'm not a huge anime fan, but I appreciate a good show regardless of style or genre when I see it. I enjoyed the original and I certainly have enjoyed this. If you like the concept but aren't big into anime then this is a good place to land. Its different, maybe not up to a ""purist"" standard but that group is never happy with anything. Do yourself a favor, don't compare everything to the nostaligia-goggled flashback and just have fun. Yeah, the dialog can be a bit hammy, but its NOIR. Its supposed to be. I'm very much looking forward to season 2.

erosdil,A fun raunchy comedy with some Retro futurism flavor,7/10,6 February 2023,"Even as someone who thinks the anime is the best piece of media Iv ever seen, I couldn't hate this show, much like Speed Racer it commits so much to being a live-action cartoon with how over-the-top it is, I loved it in a campy, kitsch, guilty pleasure way.The set design, cinematography and music were top notch, and the stunts start out ok and end up awesome by the end
Jet was done the best out of the characters his noir inspired episode was the best of the seriesyes there were some things that didn't work like removing Fayes tragic backstory and therefore character motivation, and focusing too much on Vicious and Julia when the reason there characters worked is because they were shrouded in mysteryI know it doesn't understand the meaning of the characters in the original and I don't care because ill always have the original, the mentality that a bad interpretation of something ruins the original thing really needs to die.Sometimes I do want something deep and existentialist like the anime but other times I just want a fun raunchy comedy with some Retro futurism flavor."
menriquemcm,It's not like the original (which is the best) but that's the whole point,10/10,27 November 2021,"I take this as a new take into the cowboy Bebop universe, whats would be the whole point of just watching exactly the same frame by frame but in live action? Is your life that boring to enjoy that kind of content?I like it, is fresh, it has its original touch distinguishing it from the original piece and it's well executed.

jc-71852,Love Letter? More like Break-up Text,2/10,13 December 2021,"I wanted to like this. I really did. I had my reservations about it being made by Netflix, we all did! The race change of Jet Black, a tone deaf reaction from the lead actress to fan dislike of desexualised costumes - but the allure of a classic anime and all it entails was too strong to resist... I was hardly shocked to discover that my fears were justified as the story, characters, direction, cinematography and choreography all belied its score.John Cho appeared to do his best as main character Spike, with a slight air of likeability, effort put into his aging body and some decent laughs with his shipmate Jet. What's missing is the care-free attitude that comes with being a youthful man as well as a seriousness. Instead, Cho is a blah - a nothing role, playing third fiddle among the crew of the Bebop. Mustafa Shakir proves to be best thing about CB. He proved his casting a decent choice with a true-to-the-original performance, nailing the voice and even doing well with a rewrite of his character to include a past. That is where the positives end.Daniella Pineda's casting as femme fatale Faye Valentine was stupid at best and deliberately antagonistic at worst. Instead of a confident woman who flaunted her bits to gain advantage over idiotic men, we get a frumpy, short 'little sister' who swears every opportunity and bats for the same team. With fights that didn't always go her way and an exclamation of ""BALLS!"" she was not totally without sympathy or laughs. Whereas the rest of the cast could be fresh off the streets of L. A. Gren is no longer a smooth saxophonist but a gender-neutral hipster. Julia is now a singer with one song under her belt but acts fresh out of college with a face full of Botox. New characters are given dire dialogue with explicit language for the sole purpose of appearing edgy. Antagonist Vicious is the exact opposite of his animated counterpart and it's just plain dumb.Unnecessarily jaunty camera angles adorn each shoddily lit scene with overuse of teal and orange colour toning. Yoko Kanno's glorious musical score is used and abused to festoon any scene with zero thought to tone or ambiance. CGI is steady but set-design drab. Even with all this baggage, the real killers are the writing and direction. Changes to the script are often essential in reboots, but major ones that push social agendas (in particular, ones that are so lacking in subtlety) make a mockery of the original source. The less said about the ending, the better. The whole thing reeks of desperation to please an increasingly vocal minority.Thank God the original exists, and praise him again for cancelling this awful holly-weird monstrosity."
butchcisco,Could have been better,3/10,14 December 2021,"I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen the anime. Really all they had to do was make a live action version of what was already there and they would have had a real winner. But the woke folks at Netflix have to get their dirty lil hands on anh project that can make them $$. Really such a waste.. watch the anime, skip the Netflix adaptation.

SheLikesSurprises,Incredibly disappointing,3/10,3 December 2021,"I loved the anime. Even was happy to rewatch it when it popped up on Netflix recently. But this live-action remake feels cheap, cliched, and is simply not a good show.People complained about John Cho, but his casting is the least of the problems here - both him and Mustafa Shakir show respect to the original characters and learned their antics rather well. But that's about it - Faye just phones it in, and the attempts to flesh out Spike's backstory and make Vicious and Julia into actual characters are painful to watch. While Vicious is a not-evil enough Slytherin-type villain with bulging eyes (I guess this was supposed to look ""intense""?), Julia is just so poorly portrayed that you watch her and ask yourself if this bad wig and collagen-plumped lips are worth killing or dying for.Probably not. The dog was cute, though."

kevinmwaugh,"Potential, but rushed and poorly adapted focus",6/10,20 November 2021,"I am not a diehard Cowboy Bebop fan, I'm just a guy who casually watched it, not big on anime but I enjoyed the one off stories of this space western as I had watched the anime over the last few weeks. What I liked about the anime was the humor, the atmosphere, the characters and least of all, the stuff with Vicious and Julia. To be honest I just never really cared much for that part of Cowboy Bebop. Now that may be different for many, but I was excited after watching the first episode of this adaptation because the episodes felt fun and although they reimagined scenes due to only doing 10 episodes, the creators of the Netflix series decided to have the story with Vicious throughout the episodes and although that is the easier to follow narrative, for me it took away from the things I enjoyed about the original and yes even this Netflix series.So I actually think the casting is pretty good, I enjoyed Spike, I think Jet was cast well and Faye did a better job than I thought. I will say, that spoilers**** Ed, is a terrible choice, just really cringy. Vicious is another character I think is badly cast, he lacks the terror and swagger that the anime portrayed him as and finally I hated Julia in this, she just never clicked chemistry-wise with either Fearless or Vicious and she just doesn't fit the role in my opinion.This adaptation or reimagining had some potential things but overall I just didn't like the narrative direction they chose to focus on. I love the world, the bounties and the ways the cgi showed the gritty world that looks lived in but it ended up being the story and some of the writing that I didn't like the most. I think maybe it's an okay introduction into the world and props to the actors that I believe did the best with what they were given.Then there's the music. I love it, always have, loved the original, I was kinda bummed to not have a few of the tracks that I felt were powerful moments in the anime not be shown in the episodes here. Maybe they're saving them for later seasons but I would've thought they would not have wasted those moments especially condensing this down into 10 episodes. For me the first half of this series is better than the later by far. If Netflix does do another season of this, I would watch it hoping to see some changes made and if they fix or tweak some of the things I think it could be okay.I know this review is poorly structured but I gotta say this about Netflix and their adaptation of shows. They tend to take rich content and rush through it thinking it's a good thing, it's not. Look at the Witcher, everyone was so excited but that show jumped around so much the pacing just felt convoluted. They did the same by focusing solely on the narrative of Fearless, Vicious and Julia in this and it was a poor choice. If Netflix can learn to let shows breathe a bit, trust the rich content that you're pulling from and bring that into a new live action, I think it will help them in the long run with future series they adapt. The good shows that people remember have stories that build and build and the payoffs are worth it, I feel like this series didn't put in the time to earn some of the wow factors that they were going for and they missed.I want to like this show more, if there is another season or seasons, focus on those stories that develop characters, it's what made Firefly such a cult classic of a space western and earn the moments that fans can get hyped for when you finally approach that naturally in the storytelling. Everyone wins when that happens."
blakis-04821,great entertainment !!,8/10,10 December 2021,"I did not know Manga but I really liked this show. One of the most entertaining of Netflix in recent times if you like science fiction.Good fights and special effects. I hope there is a second season...

christianbillman,"Fun, scratches that ""Firefly"" itch",8/10,6 December 2021,"Has some flaws and fans of the anime probably hate it but this is as much fun and as close to a sequel to ""Firefly"" that you can get. Has enough campiness, anime-inspired action and faux noir to stay interesting through to the end.

pm-39154,It has great potential...,1/10,20 November 2021,"It seems good until it becomes obvious that the script writers have no originality as with so much Hollywood rot.Netflix shows must include a)smoking and b)using Jesus' name as a curse.Bollywood is so much more wholesome, no matter the subject matter.

eoghan-90238,Difficult genre to convert done as good as it could be,9/10,15 January 2022,"After a depressing amount of anime converted to live action gone horribly wrong over the last 15 years it's evident that the conversion is just really difficult.So I went into this show expecting the disappointment I've experienced time and time again.Yet! I wasn't disappointed, I was delighted.Ok let's get it out of the way. Is it perfect? No, there are areas for improvement with the script and delivery but at no point was it terrible and it's something I'd expect a new cast to grow into.The set design is outstanding. I'm in awe at how well they kept true to the original source for the ship and when out and about. Absolutely incredible.Overall I'm rating it this highly due to factoring in the sheer difficulty to convert this genre as well as how it's possibly the best anime>Live Action conversion I've seen."
amrever-02120,The Rel Netflix Blues,3/10,20 November 2021,"If, you never seen the 1998 anime,.then sure have fun with it. But...if you a fan of the anime, I guarantee you will hate show.In my opinion Netflix as once again has ruined another show...CowboyBebop is not just my favorite anime of all time but one of the greatest shows ever created and Netflix as reduced it to trash. Count your days Netflix...Mustafa Shakir was fine as JetJohn Cho was ok but ,to old to play Spike.Daniella Pineda as Faye was is annoying and hated the chances they made to her.Vicious and Julia was miscast and disappointing. I hated how writers did them form top to bottom. From there casting, character development, story, and etc.Oh, and before I forget! In opinion the way the writters of the show handle and portray the character of Grine in the Netflix version compared the anime is disrespectful and shameful.One of the bright spots was have Yoko Kanno/The Seatbelts returning to compose the soundtrackOverall I gave it a 3/10 as viewing it as a fan of the original. I think the writers try to add their own spin to the live action while trying to keep the essence of the 1998 anime and don't realize what made the anime so special. From the storytelling of all the characters, the art direction, the music different themes, and genre-binding. They tried and failed. But, if you watch it and like it thats good too."
robertlukechapman,Has its moments....,4/10,19 November 2021,"Is it bad, no..... but it's not great! It's a little wooden and the casting is not quite right!John Cho was perfect and I enjoyed Mustafa, however what were they thinking with Daniella I will never know....

nicolelynnmayo,Pleasantly surprised,8/10,21 November 2021,"I was worried Netflix would ruin it, but ended up really liking it. John Cho was fantastic, excellent casting. It's a good mix of being true to the show, while also adding new elements so as to not be repetitive to the point of being boring. I thought the original anime to be a bit disjointed, but this adaptation included more backstory and continuity from episode to episode. The worst part was radical Ed right at the end.

maxalaroche,Fun and Needs Another Season,9/10,1 December 2021,"I have watched the anime a while ago and it is was amazing. This is definitely a worthy adaptation that needs another season. The casting is spot on and the music is on point. The action sequences are great and the relationships between the characters is natural and funny. I wish there were more space sequences, but that was the only thing that I really could criticize. Awesome show and keep it coming!

There are so many mediocre shows released these days, and when I finally found a diamond in this pile of dirt, some anime-fanboys cancels it, screaming ""the original is better"" and ""isn't based on canon"". No one cares what it based on, the cast is great, the script is good and the quality and details are superb.Shame on you..

mrcoronet,Not the anime... And that's OK,8/10,4 December 2021,"If you are a Cowboy Bebop fan. This may or may not be for you. It depends on why you liked the anime. I liked the back and forth between Jet and Spike. That's here. I liked the gritty setting of our semi-space faring future. That's here, too. I liked Ein being hyper-intelligent. That's almost here.If you were in it to see Faye's unmentionables, think the race of the characters matter, or can't open your mind to a different story than the exact one you watched before... You will be disappointed.

kevatshah,Damned if you do damned if you dont,9/10,24 November 2021,"It's really hard to satisfy ""original"" fans of any franchise and this is no different. I've heard a lot about how they tried to stick too close to the anime and lost something in the process. At the same time I've heard people hating it because they didn't nail the personality of one of the characters. It's almost like there is nothing you can do to keep some fans happy.All in all, I thought this was really well done. It does capture the essence of the original show really well (even if it's not 100%). If you hadn't watched the original, or just pretend it didn't exist and pretend this is just some new sci fi show, you would like it as much as shows like the Mandalorian. It's good cinematography, good acting and very enjoyable/fun to watch.

martinziegler-93808,Great and Relaxing Entertainment,9/10,28 January 2022,"The show is an absolute no-brainer, perfect for relaxing after a hard day's work.It's light, it's trash, it's humurous, and it fulfills every possible clichée. It's space cowboys. And it's amazing! What else to say?There is apparently an anime which it is based on. Haven't seen that, don't need it. The show is great as it is.The first scenes of this show already make clear that you cannot expect anything serious here. This is super-light entertainment that goes as easy as the eponymous bebop, and it's perfectly executed. All of the characters are completely overdrawn, the action scenes are ridiculous, and the storyline is so predictable that you watch it with a constant grin on your face. It's a single amazing persiflage of movie tropes, and a wild crossover between Martial Arts, Scifi, and Western, seasoned with a irresistible pinch of humour.The acting is excellent. John Cho (as Spike Spiegel) and Mustafa Shakir (as Jet Black) 100% nail their characters. Daniella Pineda (as Faye Valentine) has probably the most difficult role among the main actors, but still does her job good, and her character admittedly has some difficult scenes.With the exception of one poorly written episode, you'll be excellently entertained throughout this entire series.I don't recommend bingewatching it, rather go at a slow pace, one episode per evening. You will not regret it!9/10."
Kri3,Worth watching but not something you will want to watch over again,6/10,11 December 2021,"I think John Cho would have been better with better casting around him, without this my opinion he fell flat. The storyline in general does not flow well, it is very choppy . The episodes are entertaining but with the poor casting and choppy story they aren't memorable. The way they tried so hard to give it the old school feel mixed with the future just did not sit well. The settings, music, clothing, personalities, etc all really tried to push through the 60's feel throughout the movie really did not blend well with futuristic theme.It would have been nice to have a bit of comedy mixed in, not overdo comedy but I don't think I had a single laugh throughout the whole movie. I think they might have though a few scenes you might laugh but not even close. With the choice of John Cho I think he could have pulled off a little bit of humor to lighten the moods of some scenes. I somewhat enjoyed the series but it had the potential to be a great series but didn't come close."
thomasgreen-18510,It's not a cool as the Anime but a great to see more Bebop,7/10,20 November 2021,"I was hesitant of John Cho but he brings the Charisma and Spike and Jet both are the highlights of this adaptation! Their banter and friendship is enough to make this a recommendation from me. Faye Valentines performance is strong although there are times where she is too unlikable and annoying, she was annoying in in a naive and charming way in the anime but in this is more arrogant. Some of her added relationships seem out of character from the anime character. Unfortunately a lot of the world around our leads are hamming it up; many of the characters not feeling real and act like they are straight out of Batman and Robin. Vicious didn't work for me at all and came across as wooden and whiny rather then vicious. It's cooler and more interesting then a lot of recent television and it's a real shame that it's getting so many negative reviews from people that haven't yet even watched the show. Give it a chance and I think you will have a fun time.

biddybuddy1,Near perfect!,10/10,23 November 2021,"This live action adaptation captures the essence of the anime from visuals, direction, atmosphere, and personality. The props, the actors, and pacing. It's all very delightful.Netflix has made some minor changes, most of which is altering out sexism, and making Julia an actual character.I'm going to be honest, this is even better than the anime.

Joshuaedwardk,Great show at its core,7/10,21 November 2021,"Great show ruined by expanding 1 unnecessary character role in this story, Julia. Why did they change character at all, we never asked for a fleshed out love story. Episode 1 - 7 were highly enjoyable because they focused on the core story and critical characters, Spike, Jet & Fey.I look forward to Julia inevitable death so we can re focus on the enjoyable characters.

mrosborough-43246,Pointless and awful,3/10,21 November 2021,"Every aspect of this reboot is awful. The casting is awful ; a 50 year old, snarky jon cho playing a 25 year old, brooding spike is beyond egregious. The costumes and sets look cheap and tacky. The dynamic between spike and jet is inevitably altered like the very nature and spirit of Spike. The unnecessary character development and back stories of vicious and julia completely ruin both of them. The action sequences and choreography are way too over the top.They missed the whole point of the original show replacing the noirish, bebop - hipster drama with schlocky camp full of loose ends and side plots that do nothing to advance arcs or characters. Absolute travesty.

ashesdream,Captures anime feeling but needs to be judged by itself,9/10,24 November 2021,"I loooved the original anime series and was hyped to see it in live action. Yes, a lot of you are right, it's different to the anime and not all things are as well compared with it. But that's the point, don't compare every detail.I found it amazing as they caputered the music, the visuals, some of the characters. Ok, and they changed things too. Which is fine and makes sense in itself.Also not a big fan of how everything they did with Faye. She was so much cooler in the anime. But the sensitive, naive side of her in the live action is not bad either. Just different. Cho as Spike surprised me and Jet was great too - I actually always thought of him as black, weird that some of you thought this as bad.I for myself cannot wait for season two. So, when is it coming? 😍

blumen,Different and That's Good,9/10,25 December 2021,"Atypical take on anime to live action. Great acting with story and backfill being stretched out. Interesting flawed characters making for blend and not straight good or evil. Music fit and the action and fight scenes were fun. Very sorry to see Netflix not continuing the series. So many ways to grow.

If you like the anime version, better stay away from this live action one. Or just watch the first episode up to 30 min and turn off and go re-watch the anime version.

bvrod-37078,8.5/10,10/10,30 November 2021,"Only gave 10 to offset people sabotaging it. 8.5/10. Was on Fence when I first started watching, but after you invest a little emotion, it pays off. Cheesy dialogue at times but that is to be expected. Overall very well done. Vicious was a little painful to watch at first but that is a hard character to bring to live action. As series progresses though his character improves significantly. The added adult dialogue works and feels authentic to the characters conversing. The mixture between new and old keeps one excited while also revisiting nostalgia lane. Great work!

thunder-46,Don't expect a live action duplicate - Purist nonsense.,8/10,20 November 2021,"I find that a retelling of the stories interesting and fun. Making live action Cromwell loved anime is not easy. There have been some really poor efforts. The live action 'Ghost in the Shell' is an example. 'Cowboy Bebop' is much better. Where the hell does race come into play? I see comments that John Cho doesn't look like Spike?!?!? Really? Jet Black was originally a white guy? Give me break. Faye's actors was panned long before the series was released. I have no expectation that this should be a live action clone!I am a little disappointed with the Vicious character, and little that Ed is not included, but oh well. For those who haven't seen the original series and movie this series is likely entertaining. The interaction and dialog between the characters is quite good. This deserves at least a 7 rating."
Kenelli,Entertaining remake!,10/10,29 November 2021,"So far it is very enjoyable. Lovers of the anime series may find some aspects disappointing. I can't understand why some people are giving it a 1 out of 10. The show has good effects and keeps the jazz music.

ericallensalmon,Watch the anime. Or Killjoys.,1/10,28 November 2021,"Edit: Reducing this to 1 (from 4 previously) to offset for two reasons: 1st, it's cancelled, so the ending is really really terrible. Basically none of the plots are resolved (seems they were overconfident about getting at least a second season). 2nd, there are dozens of 10* reviews propping up the rating for this that literally say they're offsetting the anime fans reviews :-p. The show's fairly a 4 or a 5, maybe up to a 6 if you like the effects. Definitely not a 7. I can relate to people who want fans to let writers/directors/actors do their own thing, sure. Thing is, they could do that without the name. Make their own stuff instead of buying rights to something and doing a half-ass version to cash in on the name. Newsflash: anime fans wouldn't be drawing comparisons to the anime if the show wasn't named Cowboy Bebop.-------------------------------------
First off, if you hate anime but want to experience Cowboy Bebop, this isn't it, but it is probably the closest you'll get. I'd still recommend something like the first couple seasons of Killjoys instead. If you do like anime, go watch the anime. If you're already a Bebop fan, prepare to be disappointed (or just rewatch the anime).There are good bits, but all the best parts are ripped wholesale from the anime (music, characters, dialogue, even the good cinematography).Unfortunately they deviate in odd (bad) ways. You really have to question writing decisions that add a ton of screentime while making the storyline somehow less compelling.The new plotline is also basically nonsensical - due to all the changes to backstories, none of the character motivations parse very well, the villain(s) are laughably bad, and the relationships of the Bebop crew seem much more shallow.Also, for a remake that seemed focused on representation (changing Faye's entire back story and adding characters to make her gay, for example), super weird they went with a western actress for her (the character is originally Singaporean), especially after Ghost in the Shell... And they also changed the notably intersex gay character from the original amazing character by making him a very effeminate and 'camp' caricature - he was changed from a masculine ex-soldier suffering from specific, but mostly hidden side effects of estrogen in the original. Pretty offensive. Gay men don't have to be effeminate. Some of the other casting decisions for inclusion are more understandable. Mao as a woman was a good choice, and she nailed the character. Mustafa as Jet was spot on as well, aside from his voice matching the English VA perfectly, he also captured the character in an amazing way. I do question that since they cast him as a black man they also decided to make him an ex-con and absentee father (in the original, he left the police force of his own volition due to the corruption, dutifully waited for his girlfriend after she abandoned him, and had no children). This rewrite also removed a very good arc for his ex-girlfriend Alisa, who left him because, opposite the live action depiction, he was literally too good a provider - she wanted some challenge in her life instead of being taken care of.Other casting issues: Vicious' casting and re-write is so unbearably bad I can only imagine it was intentional. John Cho as Spike has good and bad points - he nails the mannerisms and sarcastic delivery, but Cho doesn't quite have the charisma to pull the character off, possibly because he's almost twice Spike's age. Really, even when he was 20 years younger he couldn't pull off ""pretty boy."" Sorry, buddy.Basically watch it to kill time, but it's not worth a re-watch or anything."
serko-69268,I'm gonna keep it simple.,10/10,27 November 2021,"First of all, people should stop comparing source material with the adaptations.The media is different, storytellers are different and most importantly YOU are a different person from the time you read/watched the source material.If we are done let's get started: 3,2,1..If you even remotely liked Firefly, you'll probably love this show.If you don't like ""cowboys in space"", stay away, it'll be a waste of your time.They are not actual cowboys, cowboy is the slang for bounty hunter in this universe. I used cowboys in space as a retro-reference.There's space travel but also combustion engines. There are lasers but also gunpowder weaponry etc..."
kaboomcal,Do not let your doubts keep you from viewing!,10/10,27 November 2021,"This show scared me at first, I judged it harshly because I thought the casting looked terrible, I still think one of the cast members is terrible but they're only in it for like 30 seconds and might pan out if there's another season.But once I got past my bias that I had from being a mega fan of the original, this show turned into one of my new favorites, they capture the spirit of the original most times, and the way the characters interact most times feels like it could fit in with the original.The best thing they did was capture the world, the world of Cowboy Bebop comes to life in this adaptation, it looks as real as can be and just like the original but in live action. They tried their hardest to recapture the original and in a lot of places they did perfect.I give this ten stars because it feels like to many people are review bombing it because it isn't the original, it never can be, nothing can. But this show deserves praise from a new audience, and lenience from the old. They made new Cowboy Bebop material almost 20 years after the last bit of cowboy bebop aired, and they did better than any other live action adaptation.The live actions of Death Note, Full Metal Alchemist, Dragon Ball, all these other shows, they fall hard and die hard, they ruin their material, but this one, this one tried and in my opinion succeeded on almost every level in making new material of a long gone franchise, and if you don't want to watch it and want to keep the original as your one and only, go ahead. I almost did the exact same thing out of fear of this being another terrible remake, but I am glad I got past my prejudice because this show is now one of my favorites, like the original before it.Summary:
Don't let your love for the original clout your judgement on this one, view it as its own retelling, or its own story, because it is not the original, nothing ever will be. But do not hate it because it is the original, follow the example of the original Spike Spiegal, whatever happens, happens. This show broke the mold when it comes to live action adaptations, it might be one of the only live action adaptations to ever be this good.So, if you have your doubts due to casting and images or what you may of heard from fan boys, give it a shot for yourself, I had the same doubts and I do not regret watching."
samisheikhibrahim,An Absolute JOKE !,1/10,22 November 2021,"Where do I begin ohhh right:
1- Actors in this show has ZERO TALENT you will cringe the whole time.2- The writing I can't describe it in one word just let me say that if you think Game of thrones season 8 had a bad writting wellll compared to this, it's a Matsrpiece.3- Faye is lesbian for some reason and she sleeps with basically every girl she meets, Spike's name in this hwo is ""Fearless"", I am not joking you, vicious is no longer the cool cold antagonist, he is now a cry baby character and the one who played him is by far one of the worst actors of all time BUT noooo that's not the end of this brilliantly written story.... Julia is the new VILLIAN ladies and gentlemen.I hate this so much it's by far the worst action live anime even worse than Death note. NETFLIX massacres every anime they make. I don't recommend this to anyone who love the legendary Anime."

does not watch a lots of Anime or didn't watch the original anime...Then I guess it will be kinda ok...ok...Not bad-Not Good...Avarage type...You Will Enjoy It...No prob...If you just looking just for a sci-fi show to watch...Go for it...But if...You watched the original show and start comparing with this...Then stop there...Starting from Spike (John Cho)Is smaller i mean Much smaller then Spike(Anime) he was Young...Charming... Cool...And what we got...Mah...And what's wrong with John's heir...And Jet(Mustafa) Sometimes ok...Sometimes...In the original show Jet was bigger, Muscular, Strong Arms But you know what we got... That much we can handle...At least those two acted well(As much as they could)...But Faye, Julie,Vicious,Ed(Just for a moment) and other characters I don't even want to talk about them...What the actual hell... Casting is too bad...I mean really really bad...Well Choreography isn't that bad...Camera work...Some good shot...And the music...That's it...You will definitely hate this show if you compare it with Original Show(Anime)...Not even close... maybe 15%or so...And the story...Fooohhhh...
The only thing that can be compared to anime is the Opening Song...Well if you really want to watch something like Cowboy Bebop...Just Watch the Original One...Moreover, there is no choice...*It is not possible to bring an anime into live action...A Real Life actor Can't compared to anime...In anime You have full Freedom to make the character as you wish...But real actors can't do the same...Just can't...

brix-14315,Really fun version of Cowboy Bebop if you're not into anime,8/10,29 November 2021,"I personally believe the rating for this show is too low, and I believe this is mostly due to anime purists that would never like a real-life version of the anime series, no matter how true one stays to the original series. But I would suggest trying to watch this with an open mind because it is actually quite good in terms of graphics, acting and story. All I'm saying is, give it a chance!

neilclough,Style over Substance,1/10,7 October 2023,"This is a classic example of style over substance. The cameraman must have been trying to win an award or something by trying to film everything in almost perfect darkness. It's impossible to tell who is doing what half the time and who is doing the talking.The soundtrack is dominated by some woeful jazz-type music that is often too loud and drowns out the dialogue, which is pretty dire at times.The storylines are completely ludicrous and impossible to follow.The characters are very shallow and embody the concept of style over substance. Fancy clothes and a bit of eastern-style fighting do nothing to distract from the fact that there is nothing to these characters.To be honest, I stopped watching after episode 3; I was bored stiff."
brndck,Much better the second time around.,8/10,22 June 2022,"I'll admit, as a huge fan of the anime, I came in with a microscope, ready to tear this new version to shreds. My initial reaction was 6/10. Overall decent, but impossible to capture all of what made the anime so appealing. Cho does his best, but is too old and not energetic enough as spike, I liked Shakir's version of Jet Black the most of all the main cast, and initially Pineda's Faye just was not working at ALL for me.Vicious is terrible. Really really terrible. Vaudevillian low budget, how did this even make it in the SHOW levels of terrible. Elena Satine's version of Julia was an unnecessary change from the anime, and she looks like lip fillers with a human attached.Now, a year later, I'm watching it again, and finding that it's grown on me quite a bit. Vicious is still terrible, but Maybe the lens on my microscope is a bit more blurry and things don't seem as bad as they did a year ago.Either way, I do wish they could have green lit a second season, to see new versions of important episodes in the later seasons, but at least we'll always have the anime."
brandonaveryreid,It Is NOT The Anime BUTTTTT Give It A Chance,7/10,23 November 2021,"It is not the anime, but it is very fun. The action sequences deliver, the CGI and sets are pretty incredible. The big draw backs are... the acting, especially by Mr. Shakir, he's incredibly stiff AND the writing, it's just poor, bad set ups for what are supposed to be emotional payoffs that ultimately feeling like a gentle breeze instead of soul shaking dramatic climax. Regardless of it's flaws, I enjoyed myself watching it and if you've seen and loved the anime like most, I'd say it's worth tuning in for the warm nostalgia alone.

But overall I thought it was an enjoyable watch and hopefully setting up a 2nd season which will improve on the show.They followed some of the story behind the original show but they tried to add their own vibe to it instead of completely following the storyline.The cinematography behind the show was great and kept to the shows original designs, but didn't do so in a way which was corny or cheesey.Definitely worth the watch, easily binged it in a day!

rsaavedra,"Fun, but certainly took liberties",7/10,20 August 2023,"Watched the full original anime, and wrote a review here on IMDB for it not too long ago, that was a 9/10 for me. This one, just a 7/10. Borrows characters and some plot pieces from the original, but boy it is not fully faithful to it. The anime hardcore fans will not like that.Positives: acting-wise I liked most of all Jet, then Spike, Faye, Ana, then Julia. For Julia, her ""I'm on Mars"" song is truly gorgeous. Vicious for me here was almost funnier than scary though. His character adaptation however is clearly not the same calculating cold-blooded commanding killer he was in the anime. Rather an impulsive psycho brat.Negatives: well, the adaptation itself. It is quite off from the original in some important points. There can be infinite ways to depart from any original, and the magnitude of the departures can also go different ways, so specific choices had to be made of course. But the ones they made leave me thinking there could have been quite some better options: either still departing possibly even more from the original, or with fewer departures, or remaining completely faithful.Something I perceived and liked from the anime was a sort of recurrent blues atmosphere. Loss, longing, sadness, failures, mistakes, betrayals, resignation. This adaptation also has that, but as if toned down or rushed through in some cases.Certain music pieces in the anime played with the images as if in a masterful and sublime artistic trance, lasting generously. Analogous scenes in this adaptation, however, even with slow motion for me seemed nowhere near as trance-like in comparison, not achieving the same level of ""blues beauty,"" also typically ending too quickly. An example: the gorgeous children's choir a capella song.Julia's song ""I'm on Mars,"" and some aspects of the ending of this 1st season seem to try to reach those sublime ""lows"" of the blues vibes in the original. I wish they had continued with further seasons. Maybe they would have managed to match, or even surpass that down the road? Who knows."

excusesicon,It's not the anime so don't go in thinking that.,8/10,24 November 2021,"On its own as a standalone TV series it's solid. It's entertaining. The actors have good chemistry. If you have seen the original anime and like sci-fi, especially series like Firefly you'll enjoy it. It has those same east meets west themes and a bit of grunge. Corporations control most things. Only difference is instead of doing the running they do the chasing.I'm not a fan of jazz so some of the themes and music are not my taste but you can get past it. It's not like an 80s Mel Gibson movie where a sax plays everytime he's in a scene or something of note happens plot-wise. It's just their music and it plays in most establishments they enter.The action is pretty solid. The characters are likeable. Good sarcastic and sardonic humor. I went in skeptical because I watched the anime and at first I was disappointed but then I just told myself ""This isn't the anime. Judge it on its own merit."" Anime isn't for everyone so in that respect this is a good way for those people to enjoy what I call an ""ANIME INSPIRED SHOW"", it's not ""live action anime"" like a lot of shows and movies claim to be and always fail miserably to do because they're very hard to recreate, especially all the over the top outbursts and violent action. It'd just look ridiculous.I only gave it an 8 out of 10 because I don't like jazz and I was bummed at first. It has grown on me though and I hope they greenlight another season."

jcmatoskx,I absolutely loved it,10/10,10 December 2021,"I absolutely love it.Yes, I have never watched the anime.All the actors did a great job bringing life to their own very distinct characters.The characters are super lovable and relatable. The plot is quite interesting and the setting is super refreshing and so are the personalities of all the characters.As I mentioned, while I never watched the anime I thought the details of the adaptation were very clearly inspired in the antics and the types of things you only ever see in animated content/cartoons/anime, and while It was striking at first, I quickly came to love it and want more of it.

sylvestersamintiarto,Enjoyable and fun experience.,9/10,11 April 2022,"I don't know what the fuss is all about. To me it's good, enjoyable, and fun. And I am a fan of the original anime.John Cho is great, all other cast members are also great. The music and soundtracks are stellar, love Yoko Kanno! The art direction is spot on, special effects are amazing, overall it's a very great package. 8 out of 10 from me!PLEASE RENEW IT FOR THE NEXT SEASON!

sgted_2000,Best show ever on Netflix! (And no I'm Not a fan of the Anime),10/10,10 December 2021,"By sons were big fan of the anime series. So when the live action came out on Netflix , I thought I'd give it shot . I was blown away from the first Episodes. The main characters are performance were absolutely spot on. But what make a good movie a great are the supporting characters/actors. All the supporting characters bring a lot to the show. Their background, their history, how they fit in the story, the dialogue is just so well written. And speaking of the dialogue, The show goes from dark, to mysterious, to fast, to brutal, to hilarious, all in the same scene . I started watching it last night and did not stop till the next night. The Action, martial arts, the gun fighting are incredible. Be truthful, I did not expect this movie to be this good. So sit down, clear your head, leave the real world for a few hours , and just watch the movie and be prepared a very good time.Ed.

Happyphantom815,Second half saved the show...,7/10,12 December 2021,"... but after just learning that it was cancelled after only one season, I guess it wasn't enough. I'm honestly a bit surprised by how badly it was received by critics and fandom alike. It was a solid sci-fi show loosely based on the anime, and if you allow to view it as such, it instantly enhances your experience. Please stop comparing it to the anime. Please stop hoping it'll be like the anime, if you're planning on watching it... If you want the true Cowboy Bebop, then you need to go back to the anime. The live action show is nothing like it, but it is/was a good show in its own right.From the looks of the teasers and previews it looked like it was going to be a faithful adaptation. I really liked the set pieces and costume designs. I was fine with the casting choices, too.So, I really like the style of the LA but story- and character-wise I was a bit on the fence for the first five or six episodes, as I didn't really like most of the changes and the artistic freedom they took. It was very strange seeing a background story unfold for two characters that were mere shadows in the anime, and I would've liked if they had kept it that way, but you gotta come up with something fresh for ten 40 minute episodes, as the original delivered very little background on most characters.But, it had truly funny moments, cool fights and visuals and the direction the story was headed to worked for the LA vision of Cowboy Bebo. I started enjoying the characters a lot more during the second half of the season. The last two episodes kept me on the edge of my seat. Was truly hoping it would get renewed for a second season... here's hoping it will get picked up by another company or streaming service.."
milesaguirr,Keeps true to the anime style.,1/10,21 November 2021,"Big fan of the anime and this does a great job at staying true to the original style. Solid production and cinematography but if you're not an anime fan then you might not love it. First live action remake that I've ever enjoyed.

simpsone-85698,Well it ain't the suave and philosophical Bebop it used to be,4/10,21 November 2021,"I want to start by saying that this isn't as bad as everyone says it is (as always). However, it ain't what a cowboy bebop fan would want. Whether it's down to the bad casting for just about all the characters in the show apart from Daniella Pineda as Faye (with a little better acting) or the weird timeline or the fact it feels like someone took kill bill and tried to set it in space it just ain't what Bebop was in the 90's. But that's the thing. You're not going to get close to that unless you get a time machine and go back to then. Cowboy Bebop was a product of its own time, we're not getting that back unless we get a reboot with animation and even then it still wouldn't be as good.I think this adaptation would have done really well as a full remake of the original. I get that would have it's own faults but cmon the props and cgi would have made this something everyone would have enjoyed watching, new watchers and old alike.I also want to add, this should have felt more like a road trip with the only locations we return to being in the bebop and the syndicates lair or flashbacks. It should not have focused on characters that no one will care about I.e Vicious, Julia, Ana, Gren and the rest of the syndicate.So is this worth watching ?Well yes and no. The original bebop watchers are gonna be pissed that it isn't as good the original, which is justified. Plus new comers are going to be put off by the fact they are completely lost (it's hard to tell what's going on unless you have watched the anime) and the really bad acting that makes it feel like a poorly budgeted mess.That being said, there is a charm to this adaptation. It did give me some laughs, mostly at the bad acting of course but entertaining nonetheless.If they stuck to the original storyline, casted some better actors and kept everything else about the show then I think it would've been brilliant. Missed the mark this time though.I highly recommend people watch or rewatch the original and give this one a miss.They're gonna carry the weight of not getting a season 2 on this one."
michaelg_,7.5 - fun sci-fi show that got cut too short,7/10,16 January 2022,"I actually quite enjoyed this show. The characters are pretty cool, stylistically the show is great, and overall it's just a light-hearted fun sci-fi show.I think a lot of the negative reviews come from fans of the anime that weren't able to separate the two showsUnfortunately the show is cancelled but still worth a watch I'd say.

poli-chronis,"6,8 is too low",8/10,2 March 2022,"Easily watchable. Not that close to the anime. I suppose that the ones that haven't seen the original and like a noir Sci-Fi will enjoy this. Great job for the intro, descent job for the casting (spike could be taller, jet could be ...hmmm whiter and fay could be slimmer). Overall there is good acting and some similarities with the real thing. If you expect a, let's say, copy of the anime just don't bother. If you are able to watch it with no expectations, then i strongly recommend. Underrated imo.

I have never watched the original show but this is just a fun series to watch.Sometimes the acting falls a bit short but the scenery and the universe and adventures balances it out.If you want to check out a show with action, humor and Interstellar adventures just check it out.

mechafx-56381,It feels like it was rushed for release.,5/10,22 November 2021,"The only thing I like about this show is the special effects. They really nail the tech aspects of the original anime series. The live variants of the Bebop, Swordfish and Red-Tail are awesome to behold. The fight scenes are fairly decent too. Everything else about this show is just so wrong. The casting is totally suspect: the only ones who seem right for their respective roles are the actors playing Jet, Vicious and Julia. The storylines are absolutely atrocious: not one of the episodes follow the concept of the original Cowboy Bebop. Instead this live version just barely grazes those established by the original anime series. The only episodes worth viewing, in my opinion, are 9 & 10. Its a shame the rest of the series wasn't written with the same level of quality and attention to detail as those episodes. This live action version for Cowboy Bebop never gets past that ""rushed for release"" feeling. It was like getting the product out was more important to the producers than putting in the time, care and effort it would have taken to make it a satisfying compliment to the original Cowboy Bebop anime series. A generous amount of each of those should have been given to this series before it got greenlit for production, much less released for streaming service."
patriotmaniac1045,Changed just the right amount from the anime,9/10,26 December 2021,"I was worried it would to close to the anime. I wouldn't want to watch an exact copy of the anime as I have already seen it. I think they changed just enough to keep what made the anime great while making it its one show. It also set up really well so the show could keep running longer than the anime.

svoop_gffg,Cancel Happy,9/10,31 December 2021,"I very much liked the show. It inherits much of its atmosphere (the low-tech props, soundtrack etc) from the original. Maybe this atmosphere is not what US viewers want these days and therefore triggers cancel happy streaming services to pull the plug very early in. Actually, couldn't you at least wait to see how such productions perform outside the US? After all, we're paying customers as well and it doesn't feel right to see a show cancelled only days after it becomes available online in Europe.

somebunnylovesasmr,So bad you'll want to put a Jericho in your mouth and pull the trigger.,1/10,5 December 2021,"The dumbest version possible of an incredible anime. The casting is sub par, the cinematography is god awful, the fight choreography is a joke, and the writing is worst of all. The dialog is predominately toilet humor that seems to be written by an embarrassing 12-year-old trying to sound cool. There's so much cringe with none of the intelligence or the soul of the original. Multiple of the characters are themselves in name only and have been completely re-written for the worst. Even the music is poorly used. It looks like a cheap fan made cosplay. The twist at the end is so stupid you have to wonder if it's some kind of sick joke. It's also incredibly toxic and hateful towards women. Huge betrayal of the source material. Very disrespectful. I ended the series knowing I had wasted my time and wanting desperately to forget everything.

Gourry Gabriev,How not to adapt an iconic series,7/10,29 August 2023,"The live action adaptation of Cowboy Bebop was very anticipated but in the end was disappointing. They strayed too far from the original source material. Casting of the main characters was great, they definitely captured the personality of their respective characters. Mine and most fans biggest gripe is how they changed the dynamic of the character's relationships. Having Spike as the older character to Jett totally messed things up. Jett was always sort of the father figure to our motley crew of bounty hunters. Plus Jett knew all along about Spike's history as a former syndicate assassin. The biggest thing that rubbed myself and other fans I talked to is the way they messed with the triangle between Spike, Vicious and Julia. Especially the fact that Julia was apparently playing both of them and then cucking Vicious. I am in no way detracting from the performance of the cast especially John Cho's portrayal of Spike, he said in an interview that he studied the character in the original anime to get all of his mannerisms down cold. I didn't mind that the scripts were a conglomeration of several episodes, though I would have liked to see some original stuff inspired by the episodes. It was a good attempt, but the powers that be behind the show missed the mark big time."
webmaster-31485,"Such a great opening season, Netflix should think again about retaining it.",10/10,26 March 2022,"I came to this show without any background knowledge of the anime original and was totally hooked by this live action, full production values version.It has great sets, great characters, brilliant storylines and that special quality narrative that really makes you want to know what happens next.Action sequences are very good, if over the top and live action heroes and villains engaging in comic book violence works as well as in any other good series.The retro futurist look and design will have you accepting old junk, new tech, strangely familiar streets on other worlds, spaceships, what seems like almost instantaneous, artificial worm hole travel, mostly without asking too many questions.If you start to lose your 'suspended disbelief' you can probably fall back on it all probably being set in some other, very weird, part of the multiverse!The noire detective feel also has room to acknowledge old school martial arts, blaxploitation and it even drops in a few verbal references to cult sci-fi movies.It is unrelentingly violent in parts but not entirely grim like some shows.I watched the first episode of the anime version out of curiousity and the live action version production crew has definitely taken the grainy old anime and filled it out in so many ways.Everything from the plot, the storyline, characterisation, film titles, music, action, are all taken and enhanced to a super realistic quality.I would watch further seasons if they were available but failing that will have to fall back on the animation to see if it reveals what happens to the storylines left hanging in the season finale.Meanwhile maybe expect this live action version of Cowboy Bepop to become a cult classic in itself."
NimanAxcan,Cowboy Bebop forever,10/10,25 November 2021,"Thanks Watanbe, thanks to all the new production, for making me fall in love again with this series, its characters, its story. You renewed a classic with a touch that only a fan can give it, nothing is the same, but yes, and this makes it Cowboy Bebop forever. Unmissable!

kuan-joe,Some good some bad,6/10,17 December 2021,"Overall is really 6.5/10. The Jazz style action adventure is quite refreshing but the whole storyline is not that intriguing. Actions are below average. The main two male casts (Spike and Jet Black) are forgettable, so as the villain.The only good thing about the series is Daniella Pineda (Faye Valentine), she really spices up the whole series. Her kind of unpredictable actings is quite fun to watch. Without her, it would be much worst.The bar tender (Mason Alexander Park, Gren), difficult to describe but he is quite special. The way he talks, he really draws my attentions. Reminds me of the bar tender in Altered Carbon (season 1).

strategghost,"A good, stylized show",6/10,29 November 2021,"It's a rather solid show until the end, managing to keep most clichés to a limit. It's not until the last two episodes where the anime tropes creep in like heavy smog.The grand finale is the show's weakest part, destroying what could have been a good story. It's connection to the source material bleeds through most there.The main cast's acting is good, the side-stories are at best great, and at worst entertaining. It has some truely funny moments, but it's not a comedy. It suffers from several minor problems throughout, but nothing that particularily grinds my gears.Had the ending been of the same quality as the rest of the show it would easily have been a 7, or even 8/10.

francismulcahygohk,Your view will depend on how you can separate it from the anime..,3/10,20 November 2021,"To get this out of the way, I want to say that whoever put this together clearly loved the anime. The main issue (and this show has many) is that the original anime was brilliant (arguably in the GOAT conversation) was as much a result of the platform it was presented in and this would always force comparisons (fair or not).The first issue here is the casting and characterisation. With the exception of Shakir (who frankly nailed Jet generally), I have to mirror what many have already touched upon here and call it an abomination. I love John Cho as a comedic screen presence, but Spike really needed an actor that could demonstrate his incredible nuance and Cho just doesn't have the range for such an iconic and complex character. An unknown actor with better range and a closer look to the original would have been far more suitable. Spike is cool and tortured and this ambivalence is really hard to execute for even the most seasoned actors. Adversely, I can forgive to a degree because Cho is so innately likable.Hassel is a very decent actor, but what made Vicious effective was kind of similar to how Sephiroth in the original FF7 worked. It was the results of his actions and the ambiguity the writers built around him (through limited screen exposure and off screen) that made him such a compelling antagonist. While I can applaud the writers for trying to go into depth more, they missed the mark hard by attempting it with Vicious. In this sense Cassell had no chance walking into it, especially in a like for like comparison. He clearly researched the character and did well considering he was hamstrung from the start. I commend him for the attempt.What I really can't forgive is the casting of Pineda as Valentine. She manages to butcher every scene she is in and it's a shame as the character is equally complex and compelling as Jet and Spike were in the anime. I place equal blame on the writers (for clearly misrepresenting and misunderstanding her) as I do for Pineda's performance. It was the wrong choice in every aspect and makes the show significantly less watchable as a result.Just as bad as the casting choices for me are the changes made to the story. I'm not going to mention as I don't wish to spoil it for others...
I'm lazy to do so anyway and real fans of the anime know what I mean. This show tried to appease fans and bring in new ones and ultimately achieved none of those. I give it three stars for Shakir's performance, and for trying to retain the musical style and feel (while messing that up also).Should have never been made, however I've seen live action remakes of equally great classics that have somehow managed to be completely unwatchable. This is not unwatchable (Blue Crow Waltz - Episode 9 was also pretty well done and highlights how much better the show could have been). I can respect those who enjoyed it and I managed to stick it out to the end. What this will boil down to is whether or not you can see this separately from the anime for what it is.. and I just couldn't."
artful_roger,Pure fun!,10/10,30 November 2021,"This show is pure fun! I haven't seen the anime, but I have to rate this a 10 to compensate for all the undeserved low ratings which almost made me skip this show. The main characters are likeable and have great chemistry. The show doesn't take itself too seriously, it has a good atmosphere, decent special effects and nice jazzy music. If you like science fiction with a little humor, similar to Firefly and Killjoys, then you will like this show!

lukewh-07487,Screwed the pooch,3/10,20 November 2021,"Such a missed opportunity, I'm a huge fan of the original series and film and I was genuinely gutted when I started to watch this live action take on it.Poorly cast or seemingly under-enthused (who the fu*# green lighted John Cho? He just seemed uninterested!) main characters and a whole different vibe to this series made for a incredibly disappointing 10 episodes and I truly hope there are no more from this team to spoil this greatly remembered and truly loved anime.

ketflix666,Good stuff,8/10,19 December 2021,"Acting was top notch from all the characters, so was the environment and production overall. Jet and Faye were especially good. Sure Spike should be younger but who cares, after the first episode it has stopped bothering me at all.Not sure why it was cancelled. It was a joy to watch, why would anyone want exact same experience again but in different form is beyond me, get a life. I did watch the original animated series twice and liked this interpretation as well.It definitely catches the overall vibe of the animated series very well, maybe for some the same vibe just does not work for different media.I think it definitely deserved two more seasons. Oh well, rule of the mob it is, too bad.

machtyn,"More than TV-MA, R-rated",7/10,22 November 2021,"Let's get the first part of out of the way, gratuitous nudity wasn't needed, fairly violent. And the language is course. If these things bother you, don't watch it. The show would be fine without it all. Those parts are unnecessary to tell the story they wanted to tell.So what is the story? First, let's cover what the original anime was about. It was a loose thread of the cowboys that found themselves on the ship Bebop, and a show that was backed by incredible music. Each episode following the theme of the music it highlighted. Some of the episodes explored the backgrounds of each character, but even Spike's involvement with the Syndicate was loose and only built to support his character as a guy with mad ninja skills and some motivations. And, yes, the conclusion of the anime tied off that thread between the Syndicate, Vicious and Spike.This new Cowboy Bebop actually dives deeper into what the Syndicate is doing and explores that part of Spike a little more. The bounty hunting is secondary to the story of the Syndicate, Spike, Julia, and Vicious.I'm 3 episodes in and there has been no cohesion with Spike/Jet to Faye or Ein other than what seems like cameo appearances. And if that's the case, I don't see why Ed couldn't have made a cameo. (Perhaps she does, but she didn't make the opening sequence.)The writing is pretty corny. But it works for what they're trying to do. The sound and set design are very nice, from the practical sets to the cgi."
cgcoutts,"Sit back, watch and enjoy",10/10,12 December 2021,"Cowboy Bebop (2021 live action series) is a fun, entertaining adaptation that develops key characters and cleverly retains the essence of the original anime while creating its own identity. Must watch!

grooveyerbouti,Enjoyable romp.,7/10,28 November 2021,"One of the trouble with any remake is fan expectation and with anime it's compounded by live action casting. If it deviates to much the complaint is it has ignored source if it's carbon copy then why bother?So cowboy bebop, as fan of original I enjoyed this version the trick is just to watch it for what it is and on that level it's very enjoyable, the main cast work well together.

gracejeanbrown,Classic Yet New,10/10,17 December 2021,"My husband and I are fans of the anime and really loved getting a live action version. We loved that elements of the old show were incorporated in this version, but also could appreciate the new things. I was hoping for a better end than the anime left us with and I wanted more stories of Spike and his friends. I also wanted to see more of Ed! We are so disappointed that this got cancelled and are really hoping they change their minds!!! I think Spike was portrayed so well and am hoping we get to see more stuff that might have happened after the anime ended."
truthreveller,Poor stylized copy of original,5/10,23 November 2021,"Many reviews giving 9-10 must be people who did not grow up watching the original anime.Cowboy Bebop anime is darker, mysterious, and dramatic. Nothing is known about the heroes until halfway through the series. Instead the show reveals most of the past backstory in the first 3 episodes.In the anime the characters barely talk to each other, as they are out dealing with their own troubled past. This was conveyed poorly in the live action version with too much dialogue and simple humor. Japanese humour is not the same as Western humor. You can laugh at something that is completely awkward without a character even saying anything.The casting is way off for most characters. Spike, Vicious, Faye, and Ed are completely off. Spike is the silent type, but comes off as a joker. Faye was more the lazy princess type who was a brilliant theif that wouldn't cook for herself. Vicious was supposed to be hard Yakuza type, instead he is the Viserys Targaryen from Game of Thrones. The best cast characters were the sub characters Asimov and Abdul etc. Those characters were perfect."
nepochtchi,An honest tragedy,2/10,21 November 2021,"Anyone that has heard of anime has heard of the classic Cowboy Bepop animated series and truly the feeling it gave yo and the way it encaptulated your mind was unlike any other.Yet here we are today looking at an actual dumpster fire having an argument with an uglier dumpster fire while still trying to cancel their evening gypsy wedding.

tobyguinness,Its good. Try it!,10/10,20 July 2023,"First of all, yes it's different from the cartoon show but it's OK. It does not have to be exactly the same to be good. I liked the 3 main characters very much. Spike was perfectly cast. He has the right attitude and mannerisms. Also I love the Jet actor. His gruff voice and cranky attitude are perfect. I also liked Faye, she was cute and funny. It was nice to see Ein too! I like the Jazz bar and the music. The look and feel of the sets was retro and gritty at times but fitting. I didnt like the casting for Ed but then there was not much to see of them. I wish there was a 2nd season so that we can see what happens next.

kuczara,Actually fun,9/10,8 January 2022,"I've watched the anime original many years ago and really liked it.When I've heard Netflix will do a live action remake, I didn't really care much, as I didn't think it will be possible to do it with real actors. Anime is just a different medium that allows you to do lots of strange over the top stuff and make it look cool.But actually. I really like it. I like the main actors and the chemistry between them, I like that they were able to keep the retro-SF feeling of the world, even the action sequences were pretty good. There were also some pretty smart artsy scenes here and there, which has nicely emulated the unique style of the original.The cast of the characters related to Spike's old life was kind of strange, but the rest was really good.All in all, it's a much better adaptation that I would think would be possible."
nwbsspka,A good show ruined by the critics again,10/10,10 December 2021,"Live action is better than the dubbed version, I watched the original in Japanese since I understand most of it, and much prefer how the live action actors handled the characters. Don't let sour critics ruin shows, if you like something, announce it, other wise it gets taken away because negative voices are generally louder.

zyzgjz,Judge for yourself. Worth watching.,9/10,22 November 2021,"Super fans will always complain about change or cry that a new property copied another.I absolutely love the original anime and ditto on what they accomplished here.I am of the mindset now that I don't want a direct translation of prior stories as long as the core ideas are still there.The Anime lasted 1 season and ended leaving you wondering. Now we can enjoy more stories, have some surprises, all while enjoying this stylistic series.It oozes with a style of its own that some will plainly not get. If you do though you are in for a treat.Netflix took a gamble and I await to see it pays off enough to green light Season 2 and hopefully more."
HidariMak,Too many pointless changes,4/10,12 February 2022,"I've seen the original anime series multiple times already, and rewatched the series a few weeks before Netflix dropped this variant. Where the original series had that ""just one more episode"" nature to it, providing tension and pathos and humor, the 2021 remake just falls flat. The humor consistently failed here. The character of Julia was a complete rewrite, being disappointing and inconsistent. While the main character ""Spike"" was fluent in the martial art of Jeet Kune Do (made popular by Bruce Lee), Netflix's Spike is only shown ""fighting"" in that style in the first episode, with more than enough jump cuts to completely destroy the flow, but not enough to cover the bumbling attempt. His bounty hunting partner ""Jet"" is rewritten from a grizzled but caring friend, to a ""goofy father"" figure, with a daughter thrown in solely for the predictable final episode. Whereas the anime series had a wide range of music styles, many of which not sounding at all out of place in North America, this series just has remixes of the jazz tunes from the anime and nothing else memorable.The anime series, being a combination of western and sci-fi and bounty hunting, was a clear inspiration for the series 'Firefly' and its followup theater release. The anime also threw in some episodes which were more film noire, as well as episodes which were just plain funny, such as its send-up of 'Alien' or the ""Mushroom Samba"" episode. Episode 24 showed the conclusion of the story for ""Ed"" and ""Faye"", who are the two other main characters, while the final two episodes had more drama and action than many of the ""popcorn movies"" which drop during the summer months. But thanks to bad writing, the Netflix adaptation killed the appeal of the characters, and dropped them into forgettable storylines. Netflix tried to mix the apple pie of the anime with the cow pie of this production. And that doesn't make the cow pie better. Instead, it just makes the apple pie worse."
Canadian_Movielover,The ending dear god why,2/10,19 November 2021,"Up until the 9th episode i was willing to write this show off as underhwhelming with some major flaws (and not only in adaptation). The acting from the main trio is great as many have noted - unfortunately the writing is absolutely atrocious and certain characters (namely vicious) are absolutely brutal.The final elevates it to an absolute raging dumpsterfire. Won't spoil it but the introduction of a certain classic character is almost comedically horrible - at least it would be if it wasn't so cringy/painful to watch. And that's not the worst by far - the choice of direction with Vicious, Spike, and Julia in the finale is disastrously bad and flat out insulting to the audience as well as the source material.Andre Nemec said:""I believe we've done a really nice job of not violating the canon in any direction but merely offering some extra glimpses into the world that was already created.""And it could not have been further from the truth."
tmmm2021,I'm not an anime fan - I liked it,7/10,23 November 2021,"I don't like anime, I could never get into it at all. So I was interested to see a new interpretation of this universe.I wasn't expecting to like this, but I did.I thought the casting and acting overall was good, not amazing but good.I found Julia unconvincing and the actor for her...not the best.Vicious was a bit TOO over the top, it just got very silly at times. Maybe that's faithful to the source material but toning it down a bit and making it less silly I think would've been better. Good actor, weird role.The main 3 characters were good.The stories were...mixed, some were fun and I watched the whole way through and others I found myself bored and skipping through.I liked the structure of the series, the backwards and forwards through time. That works for me and keeps me interested but it didn't save me getting bored at times.I liked it more than I thought I would.Would I watch a 2nd series? Yes absolutely.Would I care if it was cancelled? No not really.Visually it was beautiful and the world was really well thought out.However some of the acting was a bit meh, the characters sometimes behaved in ways that wasn't believable and the some of the stories lost my attention too."
gundamremake,Not nearly as bad as some hardcore fans say.,10/10,20 December 2021,"Netflix' Live Action Cowboy Bebop is somehow different from the original 1998 anime, but it is also a good show on its own.After 20 years, and given the format change, some modifications were obvious and mandatory.Too bad some anime hardcore fans enacted a real embargo against the show, even before it was released, posting fake reviews everywhere on the internet.On the other hand, given the high budget of the production (6 mln $ per episode), Netflix was in hurry to capitalize expecting a too high viewship on the early weeks, not allowing the show to grow within the general audience.Hence, the cancellation of season 2.It deserves a second season to give a proper ending to the plot.Anime fans too much hardcore to accept it, can just keep in not watching it.There's a online petition on Change to ""save Cowboy Bebop"". Give the show a try, then decide if you want to support the petition."
ezrikiki,Tarnished the name of a classic,2/10,20 November 2021,"The original animation is a favorite of mine and extremely well rated. I'd say it's pretty universally agreed upon that it's a classic. It had effortless style and was truly unique. This new take feels like it was written by a 12 year old - a poor imitation at best. The humor and acting falls flat and feels incredibly boring and predictable. It tries to adopt the cowboy/jazz vibe of the original in a version (even using some of the exact same music) where it simply does fit, leading to a mish mash of parts that just don't fit together. The opening scene has more in common with a sitcom, yet clearly on accident as the rest of the show demonstrates that's not the direction they intended to go.My advice? Watch the original. Old fans of the show will only be hurt by this rendition, and I'm sure new fans will enjoy the older version much more as well.

The amount of production value they have put into the show is outstanding. Even my gf that has never watched the anime agreed that it is a good show, each episode leaves you wanting more. It also has the same noir feel as the anime. Besides the great visuals, they have casted perfect actors. I can't get over how good Jet is . It isn't perfect, but the anime wasn't either and I wish we could appreciate it for what it is.

raul1794,It's just fine.,5/10,4 December 2021,"This show is the definition of mediocrity. It's not terrible but it's also far from great. The story is all over the place. The action is few and in my opinion terriblly slow. I like the characters and their interactions and the cgi is decent. I probably won't be interested in a second season.

maxelliotmager,Cho a no-go,1/10,23 November 2021,"Cho tries to play a nonchalant Spike but fails miserably instead opting for an apathetic borefest - would not reco to any one. The effects are decent but take away as it stays as a cool versus 80s sin city, not hitting either.

kellyguerra,Its An Okay Adaptation,7/10,20 November 2021,"I don't believe it is as bad as everyone says it is its somethings they do successfully and others that don't quite work.Pros:
When it comes to the CGI, Music and the visuals its actually really cool and beautiful! I think the actor that plays Jet is SPOT ON and really good! I think he's probably the best out of the cast!Cons:
I think the directing , choreography and writing is really weird and cringe not gonna lie its a lot if close ups and some jokes fall flat. When it comes to fighting some fights look like they don't connect but I think its just BC of how its filmed. And some people seem like they are over acting some times.Other than those reasons its not a bad show its definitely better than the other live actions I've seen like Death Note and Fullmetal Alchemist. Cowboy bebop EASILY beats in my opinion. I will say they do stretch the episodes but I think that's because they're making.a season 2."
leojau,Give it a chance it just started,9/10,29 December 2021,"Come on give it a chance to get more development, the story Julia-Spike started to be interesting, the past of Faye and her character was surprisingly good, the actors are good an the story has a lot or to explore. Cancelling a show is also a way to limit the vision for new stories, we don't have the anime anymore since 2 decades, we were asking for more cowboy bebop after the movie, now we have this adaptation to get more and the decision was to cut their wings, bravo.

ogiorgosladas,Fresh take on an old classic,10/10,26 November 2021,"Honestly I feel this adaptation captures the essence of the original in many ways, while making the effort to bring us something new and unique. The characters, while not the same, still feel true to the ethos of their anime counterparts. Oh and the banging music, visuals and set-design help ground the fantasy setting in way that avoids the typical Marvel-style disconnect that so often happens when the actors don't appear to be physically interacting with the spaces they are meant to inhabit.

Ladydimitrescus37,As a fan hard of the series i love it,10/10,27 November 2021,"Maybe the script it's a Little Floppy but works for me, i saw the anime like 18 years ago, and before Netflix started i watch it again and yes the OG works with the live action. But the LA have it's very own Things, good actors, Alex Hassel, Mustafa, John Cho,Dani Pineda and the introducing of Eden to the cast do a great job for catch the spirit of the bebop. As a consumer of the anime, manga and movie I'm pleased and happy with this waiting for the second season."
XanderTigerclaw,"Original was better, but still damn annoyed this got cancelled",7/10,22 October 2022,"Not the Bebop you knew (or maybe grew up with), and not the arc of self-actualisation, but a good enough romp that was itself cut short before its time (and much of its character development too).Much has changed between then and now, and the live-action reinventing - less ""remake"" and more a ""reimagining"" due to some /really/ big plot, character, and motivation changes - has absolutely lost some of the ""soul"" and brightness that made the original actually click, but I'm still frustrated with the volume of cliffhangers and loose ends we were left with here at the point Netflix pulled the plug - not just in its plot arcs but the wasted potential to develop its key characters far beyond the tidbits we were exposed to in this mere 10 episodes (the 1998 anime's 26-story run, though individually shorter episodes, seemed to have much more room to breathe somehow).Farewell to the ""new"" Faye, Jet, and Spike... and even the conflicted Julia and obsessed Vicious; we hardly knew you."

pompom32521,Painful to watch,1/10,22 November 2021,"Another Netflix's failure trying to make adaptation out of western amateur studio.It uses Bebop name just for the hype. You could really tell that the director, script writers, studio probably watch the original just right after they get this project.It doesn't deserve to use Cowboy Bebop as a title.

cj-34629,More like cowboy bee flop,1/10,21 November 2021,That's a long time fan of the series I had my hopes kind of built up for the series but knowing the track record of live action adaptations I was skeptical I was right in believing that this was going to be a disaster but I underestimated how big of a disaster it was. So to start off the things I liked I thought the dog they got to play ein was cute and could do nothing wrong. Now the stuff I didn't like everything else. Let's first start off with the ridiculous oversaturation of everything that was extremely noticeable in episode 4 where at one point you can see the color pop in in the background on a lake. Another thing is the camera work instead of the nice smooth steady shots of the original animated series we got a Beastie boys music video and which the camera never stopped moving to ridiculous angles and fisheye lenses. I also didn't like the fact that multiple characters had their personalities completely rewritten along with their back stories such as spikes real name being fearless jet having a ex-wife and kid and Faye being a completely different character. For some spoilers I really hate it how they betrayed vicious in the show churning that character who was by far one of the most intimidating characters I ever witnessed in animation into a complete joke and instead giving the role of main villain to spikes love interest Julia. This show is an example of how not to do it adaptation and should we taught in schools.
mehendricks,WHAT TITILLATION! GOOD GRIEF!,10/10,28 February 2022,"The only fault I care to mention is that the show was cancelled prematurely.From a writing standpoint it was brilliant how we were left to wait until the very final scene to see Ed introduced. That bit of titillation was meant to set up the next season. To do that to the audience and then cancel the show was criminal. Cancelled in favor of what? Some new, thoroughly iffy property? This series was made for a reason ... because the demand was there. It still is and more than ever before because now many fans are eagerly awaiting a second season featuring Ed.It seems that, quite often, the money people are so bent upon getting maximum return on their investment that they become penny wise and pound foolish."
alexi_vds,It's a mess.,3/10,21 November 2021,"The cast has the look but can't act.The directing makes it look like a student film.The art direction seems like they work 100% on 50% of the set and 0% on the rest.The photography department needs to go back to school.The editing is following the art direction ways. To be honest, the whole production is.Half-ass production.

sonyasobel,Actually pretty awesome!,9/10,28 November 2021,"Cowboy Bebop is my boyfriend's favorite anime. He's obsessed. He has been looking forward to the live action since it was announced, and honestly, it did not disappoint. We both really, really enjoyed it! I'm not sure why everyone is hating on it so much - for once they made an anime into a live-action series and it didn't suck. This series added to the story line, and showed all of the character building and story building elements that are only hinted at in the anime. You get to see the back story you guessed happened in the anime come to life. It also made the characters more relatable, and it was nice that the action felt more realistic and plausible. Yeah, some things were different, but it was overall great. Thanks Netflix.

madroscoe-53570,Cowboy Bebop,9/10,22 February 2023,"I watched Cowboy Bebop straight pretty much through and I thought that the camera and the color as well as the dialogue were pretty good: for example, there are several emoticons in the anime that were challenged too the live action that I thought were pretty good. Where in the anime they're making some weird face and there are kanji or whatever then in the live action something was said which was casually truthful to conversation. Overall the plated-notion that the good guy will always win led too some near fourth wall breaks in the dialogue but it wasn't too much as the bottom of the barrel for television an monotony is deeper. The show was good. I liked it. I hope they get the second season.

natesargeant,Use the source material,2/10,20 November 2021,"I don't really understand why they do a remake of something good and then decide to shred the story. If you are going to follow the original, the follow it. Don't jump jumble and mess the whole thing up. It doesn't make sense to just dookie on the original fan base, new fans wouldn't know the difference. If they had done a continuation of the story or even made original contents it would have been better. All they ended up doing was making the fans look at it like the he-man remake. Also spoiler they made Fey complete intolerable.

koreon-25216,"If you're going to redo a successful franchise, keep the stuff that worked",2/10,20 November 2021,"While there is a fair, and even occasionally successful attempt to recapture the visuals and humor that made the anime what it was, some of the most important themes and characterizations are just missing from this remake. Certain scenes are one-to-one replications which is always nice to see as a fan, but other than the aesthetic nods, the heart isn't there.The original is a deliberate slice-of-life story about a very believable, but romanticized 'western' version of our solar system. Very little of the broader story was told directly beyond the flashbacks and Spike's character moments. Visuals and dialogue were usually slow paced, weighing on the themes of the episode and leaving space for the sarcastic humor. This adaptation has every character spitting out their lines at maximum speed so we can get to the next action sequence and unveil the mystery of Spike's past which is spoiled in the first episode.In episode one of the anime, it opens and closes with Spike and Jet joking about being poor and hungry bounty hunters. The adaptation's first episode opens with a heist/gunfight and ends with a piece of the story that doesn't come until near the end of the original series.In attempting to recreate a classic while throwing a 'modern' take on what was already perfectly fine science fiction, this fails to be anything that it strives to be. John Cho falls flat as Spike and while the rest of the cast does a valiant job, putting Yoko Kanno's music in the background, copying some shots, and calling it a day does not generate anything even close to a competent show."

deusdocu,Good title if not expecting impossible.,7/10,18 December 2021,"I mostly through it and its not THAT bad as some people claim.Similar as with other anime based series I will not compare it to anime.Overall it is fine, entertaining. Music is great, but some from Anime.Intro is nice, has some funny places but is mostly faithful while adding some original touches.Anime itself is adapted well, different but adapted well, leaving some nice things for fans.Overall enjoying it so far, already saw Ed spoiler and not a fan of that, I understand opinion of people who dislike that, but giving credit where credit is due, it does try to be more faithful to original in place maybe it should not be.At end so far I will give 7 with a minus, but still 7. I have few episodes left, lets hope it does not disappoint at the end.Worth the watch, especially if you are not familiar with the material, maybe it will bring you into anime world."

The story is solid on its own, without having to be constantly compared to the anime series. If you liked Alita and Badlands, you may enjoy this show.

arturo_po,It is really hard to do a live film of an anime,8/10,1 December 2021,"Spike done a good job of being relax while being a good fighter.Jet, ein and faye best portrayalVicious did a really bad acting. He always look tense and annoyed but when its in the anime he looks so serious.The story line is almost the same theres no argue with that.

raytiger-75339,"Half good, half bad",6/10,22 November 2021,"The writers have done a good job at twisting the plot in a few ways to be more suitable to live action, or simply be slightly more interesting.The issue however is that they made some changes which are not faithful to the originals at all and are rather off-putting. Every character related to the red dragon syndicate has been changed, mostly for worse. Additionally, Faye Valentine is not a femme fatale anymore. She's just a snarky brat without much comic relief either.Additionally, some villain actors are rather off in terms of acting. Animation has the benefit of voice actors only needing to focus on voice acting, while in a live action show actors must focus on voice acting, body language and facial expressions simultaneously. This doesn't always work out if the role is very close to the line between 'evil maniac' and 'cringe'.Spike and Jet are absolutely fantastic. Additionally, the setting is quite immersive and hand-to-hand combat scenes are amazing: unlike blockbusters, they don't jumpcut 3 times per punch, but cut enough to make the actions seem really fast and smooth.Even if you're turned off by some reviews regarding the changes to Faye/Vicious/Julia/etc., the show is most definitely worth checking out an episode or two: perhaps you personally aren't bothered by the character changes."
hustonstl,Extreme fun throughout,10/10,3 December 2021,"Watched the anime all the way through for the first time to prepare. Live action definitely lived up. I enjoyed The actor who played vicious in the boys and he definitely delivered with this!

ssimonsen-91442,Bad quality,1/10,4 July 2023,"To make a series like this you need high quality to make it believable. By quality I refer to: great acting, great cgi and great storyline. Which this series does not have at all.The anime is great tho. Watch the first episode of both and choose.Btw: they changed a lot, and I've only seen the first episode. It's a shame because many plots that was building up in the anime over time, was just revealed in the first episode in the live action, which hurts the overall story.The iconic style in the anime, which is why it's so loved by everyone, is gone. Sadly only the music and the intro are there. The way it was filmed is so traditional and normal, which is absolutely not the aesthetic cowboy bepop is know for.

archetyperesurrected_7,"A flawed, yet entertaining live action of a beloved anime series",8/10,11 January 2022,"Let's face it, this series was doomed from the start. Whether it was good or bad, this live-action adaptation was going to fail nonetheless. However, I really liked it for what it was. There were few things I would have changed (Ed's look for example), but most things that made Cowboy Bebop a unique anime are here in this Netflix version.The special effects are really good for a TV series, and I think the campy tone they went for was okay. However, I think the people in charge should have made a sort of ""lost episodes/missions"" instead of re-telling what we already know. It would have been better I think.I know the series has been cancelled, but I think that over time it will reach a cult status, despite the hate it has received."
chaplin-97142,Forget all the critics,9/10,21 November 2021,"I'm a fan of the anime & I seriously enjoyed the h*** outta this show. Yeah, sure, it'll tick off some die-hard fans. But taken on its own merit the show is a hoot from start to finish. I especially enjoyed seeing John Cho using his magnetic charm to full effect. So, yeah, forget all the critics & watch this show.

pikachumills-66908,Don't leave things in the fridge,9/10,1 January 2022,"I am enjoying the re-imagined series, the soundtrack and atmosphere is engaging, and I was looking forward to the future episodes such as 'Don't leave things in the fridge' etc. Kudos goes to Netflix and the excellent cast, Spike brings the man with a past, Fay brings the sassiness, Jet holds the family together. And Julia along with the brutal Vicious add the intrigue. This show only came out in November 2021 and already so much internet hate from those who prob didn't even watch the Netflix show, which is only half of series 1. Netflix please show us who is boss of the internet, and make the other episodes from season 1 to complete the story. Tell 'em EIN said so.

bigmoneygator,"Not the same as the original, but something new.",8/10,21 November 2021,"The live-action version isn't the same as the original, but has a brand new flavor all its own. Cowboy Bebop has always been my favorite anime of all time, and I was really expecting this to be terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised.The casting is par excellence. They absolutely nailed the funny banter between the leads. The show touches on some of the more iconic storylines from the original while making them more interesting and adding depth to the story. The additions make the story much more complex and rich. The direction and scene composition reads like a 70's kung fu movie meets film noir, if it was directed by Bryan Fuller.My only complaint is that Julia is pretty boring and kind of whiny. I had hoped that the lead's romantic interest would be interesting instead of whiny and unlikeable.

avitavarayan,A watered down tasteless mess.,4/10,20 November 2021,"They completely miss the point of the original series. It's as though the producers never even watched the original anime, instead they had someone with brain damage describe it to them and they wrote the scripts off that.But hey at least they got the music right by just doing a copy and paste.

shazley-sahib,Actually pretty good,7/10,24 January 2022,"I came in with absolutely zero expectation or rather, i thought that this would be an abomination but to my surprise it turns out pretty good. I did watch the anime many years ago but i almost forgot all about it. The actors did a great job especially Jet Black/Mustafa Shakir. I really love the set. It's well done and the CGI looks good enough. But what glued this together is the music, thank goodness they picked Yoko Kanno for the music.

bsanford-36130,"Think of the Anime as Inspiration, not Adaptation",8/10,24 November 2021,"I have seen the Anime, and am currently 6 Episodes into the Live action. It follows the general story of the original, with more fleshed out conflict between Spike and Vicious and the relationship between the characters. The producers and writers really put the extra time per episode to use there, which makes the show very enjoyable to me.Don't think of this as a shot for shot remake, and remember that a lot of the style and visuals in Anime are very difficult to reproduce in live action. With that in mind, this show does a nice job with doing some other things right-including incorporating the style and jazz noir theme of the soundtrack and visuals.The place I really ding this show is the casting. It's... OK. Spike has grown on me a little bit. Faye is... Meh. Not superb, but not terrible. Jet is the only great cast out of the big 3. Viscous is decent enough, but Julia is slightly disappointing (thus far). Also disappointing to not see any Japanese born or Japanese American actors however, missed opportunity there.Overall, if you're a big fan and want this to be just like the Anime, you will be disappointed. But if you just want to watch it standalone without the Anime to compare it to, you will very likely enjoy it."
Zeppelin86,Regardless if it's an adaptation..,1/10,22 November 2021,"It's still a very off beat show that looks as if it was torn from a comic con seminar on A Monday. The writing is very mediocre, the acting chemistry is way off, the way the film was even lit/colored/cut is amateur hour. I'm seeing a lot of ratings on here of people giving 9's and 10's which is absolutely ludicrous. Just goes to show the bad taste in film that some of these people have. I mean this is pretty bad. Adaption or not. This is bad.

I love the original, and I was surprised at how well it captured the spirit of its source material, even if it's not a line-for-line remake. It's its own thing, while still being satisfying for fans. Take it as such and buckle up.

Pocky7,Bad adaptation !,4/10,20 November 2021,"This anime is like my bible, ive never done a review and i propably never gonna do one again. Watanabe is a great director, but also a business man, so i can understand why this live adaptation exists. I don't know how deep he has been involved in the project and i don't want to know. They just took episodes and re-made them with no flavor, even the opening.The casting is bad, but that's normal when you try to make an adaptation of an anime that's have character with no real proportion. The cg is sometimes good, sometimes really bad, same thing for the acting and the environment/decor. Even if it has been a fan-fiction, i'll say ""why like that ?""
You can do something funky, dark, deep, with this universe but not like this.Shoutout to Netflix for the waste of money and time !

But, I love SciFi shows so I thought I'd give this a shot. I definitely saw a lot of the acting that was pulled from an Anime show, and enjoyed it! But more than that, I had a lot of fun watching this corky, sometimes cheesysxifi western. I wrapped up Lost in Space recently, and while it was fine, I just didn't have nearly as much fun as when I watched this show. I would really like the cast to come back for another season!

A lot of hardcore animé fans seem very very very upset that their precious animé wasn't the same. Don't think it fair to give poor ratings because it's not the same. It's what one can expect of adaptations.It's very refreshing to see a si-fi serie that doesn't take itself too seriously.Very interesting characters and backstories. Would love to see how everything turns out in the end.

chadmk-67716,Ambitious,9/10,16 December 2021,"I'm going to get straight to the point, I like it. I like it a lot. I've also seen the anime many years ago, so naturally I have some expectations for the live action adaptation.What I can say is that the essence of the original is there, and the cast have shown dedication to the characters they portray, and yes there was some changes.These changes of course will rub others the wrong way but I'm not a purist, so it didn't bother me. However, it's these changes that compelled me to keep on watching, to keep on binging. Now don't get me wrong, there are many similarities when you compare the anime against the live action but none of that interested me. I mean where's the fun in watching a show when you already know what is going to happen? Think about that.This brings me to my last take on the live adaptation.Yes it's not a 1:1 carbon copy of the original, and turning 25min episodes from the anime to 45-50 minute episodes on the live action is what I call ambitious. It succeeded in keeping my attention, and it leveled the playing field for fans of the original and new comers alike by providing a fresh new experience that was very much needed."

goheels-16052,A Different Perspective,8/10,21 November 2021,"I'll lead off my review by saying I've never watched the anime. I never plan on watching the anime either. I see that a ton of the bad reviews are people comparing it to the source material. This review isn't for that group of people.Now that we've established that, I had no expectations when I started this show. I love futuristic space shows and the whole space cowboy plot was really intriguing to me. I thought it was extremely entertaining. The visuals are great and I enjoyed the acting quite a bit. I also enjoyed the build up and mystery of the plot as the episodes went on. I took off 2 stars because of how cheesy the dialogue felt at times and the fighting sequences at times feel a little robotic. But neither one of those issues causes me to dislike the show.If you are like me and haven't seen the anime version, I think you will enjoy this show. It's not the greatest series I've ever seen and that's perfectly okay. It's a fun ride with a good plot and great space visuals."

andresymedio,I will make comparisons between the two!,8/10,22 November 2021,"But it's not what you expect. I'm not gonna be complaining about how Faye is not physically the same as in the anime, or about the casting in general. I think the casting is really really solid. I loved the bebop crew, the syndicate, the villains. Daniella does an outstanding job as Faye (and actually was my favourite part of the series overall), she captures the essence of the character like 100% and then adds some interesting things of her own.My only complain is, where the hell is Julia's arc going? Doesn't make much sense to me so far. First episode she lets Vicious hit her? Like... for real? Then she goes mad and becomes the antagonist? I don't get it really. She's a very strong character in the anime, even if she barely appears in it. I just find it hard to believe her turning heel out of nowhere.Despite that little thing there, (which I really hope makes more sense in the 2nd season) I think the series is good, effects were not as good as I expected, but decent enough.I think it does capture the vibe and tone of the original anime, adds a bit more exposure, but it's never too much imo. I found myself laughing a lot sometimes. Though I didn't cry (I can't atop crying with the anime for some reason).Now, about Udei...They should have done something closer to the anime, like, the dude is a cold blooded killer, here he's just a coward! Still, really nice episode.And again, Faye is just hilarious and I really enjoyed her role! I kinda get where the negative comments come from, but I mean, give the guys a break, there's just no way a human can look exactly the same as an anime character! Look at yourselves in the mirror once in a while (some reviewes are too harsh on the cast's physical appeareance), and let go off the hentai, I mean anime aesthetic a bit, ok? Grow up!And anyways if you like the anime, go watch the anime, it's a masterpiece, watch it a thousand times if you'd like! (I have watched it many more times than I can remember) But this is a different thing, and it may not be perfect, but it's definitely worth watching.Just.... Julia, for real, wtf? Hehecheers! Love you Daniella, hope you read this!"
pabloatzona-89632,Would have been a solid 7...,4/10,20 November 2021,Up until episode 9 and 10 the show was actually pretty good and enjoyable to watch but for some apparent reason they took a massive detour in episode 10 and pretty much ruin the show. Any fan of original anime will be severely disappointed. They were building up a great foundation and it seemed like they were different writers for the last two episodes because it didn't have the same flow and the story seem to be improvised with no prior built up.
sanchez-65198,Best anime to live-action/ still not true to anime but better than any other,7/10,25 November 2021,"Thought they did a decent job. Too many sorry changes to make it feel like the original bebop. Still worth the watch though.I've been a bebop fan since I 1st watched it subtitled. Then dubbed, vhs, dvd, and now blu-ray.Those who say ""isn't true to the anime"" are correct. Although they seem to forget the difference between a cartoon and people acting.Don't wanna spoil much but every main character Jet-Julia all seem to game different back stories/motivation compared to the anime. Again, anime(cartoons) don't port over well to live-action.This is the best I've seen compared to so many HUGE disappointments. Read and believe what you want. Only you the individual can make your own opinion."
pizikeplika,Dissapointment,5/10,20 November 2021,"It wasn't all bad. I mean the CGI was decent and the acting wasn't B rated. But first of all. It does NOT live up to the original series. And they have butchered the original perfect soundtrack. I hoped till the last minute that my favourites from the old series would come. Spoiler alert - they will not. (Which was a tease because some of the soundtrack was the same as the old)

kjoneslobo,I killed my cowboy bebop abstinence without asking for it.,10/10,5 February 2023,"10 minutes after the show started my prejudices about it just entirely vanished. People often forget about the meaning of ADAPTATION. Same case today is happening with brazilians (my country) fans about Last of us. People distills poison-hate trying to hide their homophobic feelings saying ""series is not the same as the game or the anime"". Well, simple, adaptation and, most important, CONTEXT. I just loved how Spike and Jet were undressed in order to show their fragility and how Daniela Pineda made Faye Valentine even more strong and badass! I always wanted to rewatch cowboy bebop, but I never got past the first episode, this series gave me more than that, a new experience sometimes even better than the anime.

kim-bergstrom,What happened there?,6/10,19 January 2023,"I'm at a loss. The first seven episodes were too funny and kitchy space western with weak, simple and predictable plots and underwhelming characters. Fair entertainment when you're down with a fever like I was. But in the last three episodes Cowboy Bebop grew some serious balls. It was nailbiting and intense, with just a sprinkling of humour. All kinds of character development and surprising twists. After episode seven I fully understand why it got axed. But after the last three, I would definitely have watch a season two, to see if they kept the intensity, the quality of the plot and the characters up. What happened? I can't understand that the first seven and the last three episodes were produced by the same people. I'm at a loss.

derk-29855,I really want to like it.,3/10,20 November 2021,"The simple things to put focus on were missed on this. Everybody on the Bebop has a grudge against the world. They are charismatic bounty hunters, though, and their struggles to get food and keep on keepin on are entertaining enough without side stories that don't add anything worthwhile. Jet's big payoff moment that lets you know why he has a grudge is like 12 hours into the anime. You get to know him, then, much later, find out the ways he's been beaten down to become who he is. This one slaps you with it 15 minutes in. There's no getting invested and asking yourself why he's such a brute and unfriendly with people, while taking care of bonsais in his free time. All of those questions about why they are who they are have incredibly unfulfilling, slapped together payoffs. I liked the idea of either a faithful remake of the episodes or showing new stories on the same timeline (sort of like between the anime episodes adventures). It has a mix of both of those, but in a disappointing way. One great episode in the anime was the crew stuck in the bebop for the whole episode, because their characters are good enough to make one setting work for 30 minutes. Some of that makes it into some of the episodes, but most of it is tossed out the window. A few scenes do have that feeling of the source material shining through, but then its interrupted by needless and excessive swearing or some other ""totally not what Cowboy Bebop is known for"" thing. I really want to not be disappointed because, hey they're expanding a cool universe, but yikes, I don't really like how they've done it. Change the reason Ein is expensive, throw away the man that drags the coffin to add in a strip club episode, everything about the guy that woke Faye up could have been done faithfully, but throw that very important part of her character in the trash. Everything with Julia and Vicious seems excessive compared to the roles they play in the anime. There's just a lot of weird choices with the writing. Unfortunately I can't see a second season, but I don't know that I'd watch it if there was.Edit: After finishing season one. What an incredible waste of a good story. Every main character plot point was thrown in the trash. Things that I'm genuinely curious about - Why is Julia not... just dead? Why is a major plot point trying to appease the made up character that is Jet's daughter? Spike being hungry is such a small scene in this version, though it is a driving force in the anime. The timeline is absolutely wacky. Iconic characters like Rocco and his sister are replaced with Gren and a ""this is the worst timeline"" version of Annie. They clearly had the time and resources to do it right, but butchered the timeline and characters to... get a more exciting single episode? I don't understand. I would forgive not getting to a single main character's crescendo in a fulfilling way, but everyone's payoff moment is either tactlessly puked out quickly or totally rewritten. Even the intros of main characters like Faye, Ein, and Ed are the most uncharismatic disappointments. There's this moment where the crew sees genius hacker Ed for the first time and realize it's a 12 year old that was thrown out for no reason. If there's a great template and you just have to find a way to recreate it or fill in the blanks, why make such a mess of it on purpose? This is just like the video games. Someone really wanted to throw a bunch of money away, and here we are."
redmandools,What more do you need?,10/10,21 December 2021,"This shows is a slick as it is clever, as stylish as it is well acted with twists, turns, thrills and spills. It has everything from mad men wielding samurai swords to gun shooting hip slinging futuristic cowboys and cool CGI of cowboys blasting around space. Spike is the coolest character on TV, Jet is bad ass and of course the lovely Miss Valentine. Great show, well worth a watch even if you haven't seen the anime.

hannersd,A great show inspired by a classic.,8/10,19 December 2021,"Honestly very surprised how faithful this is to the source material while bring something new to the table. Adapting popular anmie into a live action film is hit or miss imo, and Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime ever so this had a tall order to fill from the beginning. I think the casting is great, but sometimes the special effects seem Sharknado level cheese (beside the interior of the ships and Bebop). My favorite part of the adaption is the martial arts and action, that the original is known for. The performance by the main cast is top notch. I will admit thay the weak point is the actor who played Vicious, who can come off as over acting. Overall terrific so far.

trthecoalitionofchaos,"Less Cowboy Bebop, More The Boys",8/10,23 November 2021,"From the getgo, it was obvious this was going to be different. But unlike Death Note, it's different in a good way.I like the anime well enough. I'm not a huge anime fan at the best of times (Never recovered from SAO) but I've enjoyed what I watched of the anime, and plan to finish it.Like the title says, this is less Cowboy bebop, and more The Boys. As someone who loves The Boys, I adore this. It's bloody, funny, and just a little bit silly. Give it a watch, but for the love of GOD don't go in expecting the exact same as the anime.

xqsister,Clear sense of identity that seems lost on many.,9/10,26 November 2021,"I was lucky having the relationship I did to the original series. Enough knowledge to enjoy the nostalgia but not obsessive enough to be disappointed by any liberties being taken.This is the best anime adaption I've seen. It's fun and translates well to live action, but unfortunately was always going to be divisive because of the cult fan base. That being said, as a witty space opera with an incredible update of the soundtrack and well choreographed action scenes, I think it's cynical to just automatically hate the show for the sake of it. The most important thing was to capture the spirit of the original and it would take a miserable person to say it failed at that.Check your expectations at the door and just allow yourself to enjoy, you're not cheating on the original,

gustavohmsilva-37504,"For the Anime fans, the only review you'll need to read basically...",3/10,20 November 2021,"I gonna be really harsh here...I watched The first episode with my wife (we're both huge fans of this anime) and for both of us, it was so bad that we had to watch the first episode of the anime again right after it, just to ""detox"" ourselves.Fight sequences were made too slow as they were made to even a idiot understand each punch, lacking the fast pace animations that made everything swing beautifully from melancholy to action.The changes in basically EVERY CHARACTER, from Asimov to Vicious broke the entire tone of the series. I don't think any actor hit the right chord. But aside from the main cast, the change that hit me the most were Asimov's partner. She was a woman driven to get out of there, no matter how, the adaptation made her into a little princess that wanted to escape her castle with a peasent. They removed all of the depth in her character, specially at the end, where the biggest change happened (her not killing Asimov).The actor who did Spike is actually a great actor, but everyone were completely misdirected. I blame the director honestly... Even the jokes Spike does have a subtext of how he was basically a person stuck with something that he can't budge of. The adaptation turned him into a mocking.The photography of the show was WAY OFF! The visuals in the anime carry a lot of noir style tones, contrast way down. The live action turned everything flashy and high contrast, killing the tone that could have helped set the mood for the main story.Faye, OMG! They turned a femme fatale into a annoying brat, I think this sums it up for her, needless to say more.The casting for Julia was way off. Her beauty in the anime was as of someone who was so beautiful, that she seemed off character in the setting of the story between her, vicious and spike. Basically a top tier model that never had the chance to get out of her original home and ended up eaten by misfortune. The Netflix version tho. I have no other way of putting it, looked like a basic pimped up housewife.A lot of the music chosen for the scenes just didn't matched the mood of the situation, and I'm really weirded out by the fact that yoko Kanno accepted to work with the series. I don't know officially how deep her connection with the anime runs, but it sounded strange that she would accept to put her name and go to the lengths of remaster the soundtrack with the seatbelts if she had seen the edited and color graded version before hand.I don't mind the changes in ethnicity for Jet, I really don't! But his beard looked SO STRANGE! I would honestly have preferred if they had deviated more from the original and made it more compatible with him instead of with the anime.Honestly, it feels that no one in the production actually watched and absorbed the anime prior to producing the show.One last note is for Jet's change in story line that was completely uncalled for and add nothing but a cheap attempt at a running gag joke.It was a deep disapointment."
dherana,No bang ...,6/10,23 November 2021,"Shinichiro Watanabe's original Cowboy Bebop 1998 anime is a mix of speculative sci-fi adventure, cyberpunk, jeet kune do, Kurosawa samurai, space opera, crime noir, spaghetti western, urban thrillers and so much more.Netflix live action is an unapologetic version of the iconic anime series. A remix of the original episodes with familiar characters and entertaining story points but flawed with different plots. Too much attempt to add original flavors to the mix misfires.From the iconic opening theme 'Tank' and ending song 'The Real Folk Blues' with Space Lion / Goodnight Julia and other great tunes in between, soundtrack is perfect with Yoko Kanno's return as composer of the live adaptation.

But with the wannabe white guy yakuza member and the terrible jazz. Not every bit of music is everyone's cup of tea, I don't like jazz that much but there is some jazz there everyone can be like yea that sounds good. But this jazz seems like it was made by someone who has mastered the instruments to be able to play, but just doesn't have any soul. Oh and just the Asian weird vibe to it, this show feels like some race trying to steal another's thunder. This show passes the time, but I do not recommend it as something to watch.

metatomato,Let's Be Honest...,8/10,22 November 2021,"Let's be honest about this show. Is it as good as the original anime or the movies? No, but it couldn't be. The original anime was so stunningly fresh that it would have been nigh on impossible to catch that lightning in a bottle again. (See: The disaster that was The Ghost in the Shell live action movie)I'm three episodes in and I'm actually kind of pleasantly surprised. The casting choice was pretty bold and initially I had some resistance, but Cho seems to be coming through. The carryover jazz theme is comforting and appreciated and you can NEVER go wrong with Yoko Kanno. The sets are reminiscent of the original BeBop with perhaps a tinge of Firefly/Serenity(?). Of course, there had to be some accommodations made as these are actual people in the roles and not anime figures (e.g. Faye Valentine's wardrobe), but overall, I'm looking forward to finishing the series.

jsmit-26797,Underrated,8/10,26 April 2022,"I generally hate reboots and sequels more than most people, but I have to give this one credit. There are 2 types of people that won't like this show.1.) People that have never seen the original anime and simply don't get it.2.) Diehard fans of the original that can't see past the inconsistencies in the storyline compared with the anime.The fact of the matter is that in a lot of ways these guys really crushed it. They did a killer job of making a live action show that really feels like Cowboy Bebop.I would encourage any Cowboy Bebop fans to try to watch this with a fresh set of eyes. Try not to compare it to the original anime and appreciate it for what it is.There are a couple of things I would have liked to see different with regards to the story, but don't want to give anything away.All and all I think this was a bit underrated. I wouldn't be surprised to see Cowboy Bebop fans start to embrace this more in a few years."

Sure it's not dead accurate to the anime, but it is no doubt an awesome show.Humorous, witty, action, mystery, affection, hate, retaliation, and so much more all bundled into a cool series.We are disappointed this series was cancelled way too soon, should have kept it going. ...if Netflix doesn't pick it back up, hopefully another network will build off of it somehow and make that $$$ while kicking off entertainment for us all to enjoy.Who at Netflix pulled the plug so early? Clown buckets."
angeldrop-93602,LOVE this adaptation. Please #BringBackBebop,10/10,16 December 2021,"This show is EVERYTHING! The cinematography is Amazing, the lighting and color use is Gorgeous, and the casting is Perfection! It's art - through and through! Its been a long time since there was a show that really grabbed my attention; really drew me in and gave me hope for the future of television. My heart sank when I heard the news it was already canceled. This masterpiece barely had time to breathe before it's spark was snuffed out. There is clearly a lot of effort and love poured into this project. It deserves it's chance! The cast and crew deserve their place in the Bebop legacy. And the fans (and soon-to-be fans) deserve to have the opportunity to fall in love with their Bebop all over again. Please Bring Bebop Back #BringBackBebop.

emilyuk,So close.,5/10,19 November 2021,"To put so much effort in castings and dedication into the main roles to best represent the anime, to then toss it all into a dumpster and miscasting one of the main characters 'Faye Valentine' is shocking and deplorable. The actress they had chosen did her best but she is not Faye and that alone destroys the dynamic between the main characters. Why spend so much time and effort into creating so many awesome and visual sets, to then ruin it because the female lead doesnt fit their ascetic, is very sad, as they could of had a gem otherwise.

stevendbradley,"Awful casting, worse script",1/10,20 November 2021,"This could of been something but budget cuts must of impacted the script writers and choice of actors. GOT shows us why these two ingredients are so important to making a show worth watching. The acting is second rate and the script is just plain awkward, pathetic and not on par with the visuals.

schraegerad,Thanks to my ignorance,9/10,9 January 2022,"I did not watch the original series. Obviously the soundtrack is the best of the show. The visuals are fun to watch, and even though there happens to happen some bad acting and missed timing here and there, probably a few budget related flaws, the characters might carry you on their journey through their beautifully wicked all-losers post-punk-apocalyptic interstellar bountyhunters story, put in a vinted 60s to 80s interieur. Kudos for the effort.

tenkojo,Don't compare so much to anime,9/10,25 November 2021,"Summary Opinion
My first thought upon watching the live action was about just how cringe it was in relation to the original anime. After watching many terrible review videos on youtube I started to come to the realization that I and along with many fans are being excessively pessimistic. The humor and the loose dialog in the live action really is the worst part because they use too much of an annoying cringe American comedic/ colloquial style of speech but overall the entire thing really is an interesting take on the show and is extremely entertaining if you are not constantly comparing and finding things to hate about it. After getting past episode 3 things started to clear up. Overall this show isn't made to be literally ripped apart for its dissimilarity to the anime, yes it is supposed to respect the original but there is no need to go insane of the differences. If you change your perspective there is much to enjoy about it. Also the philosophical ideology of the creator of the original that created many of the thematic undertones that dictated how viewers felt about and understood the original really in all honestly don't need to be translated one to one it is an unrealistic expectation if you see that the live-action is supposed to be faster and more entertaining not as noir and slow-burn...On Ed
Without seeing how Ed's character is developed I can't really judge the entire character implementation just based on that first cringe seen, which was definitely such a bad and forced introduction to Ed's weirdness and excitement. There is hope regardless.On Vicious
I honestly so far hate Vicious only because he is a very annoying crime boss to listen to and watch in terms of how he acts. Like he should be more professional and cutting-edge without all the grimy try hard stuff. He should be dark but not sloppy, like I hated the scene where he just vulgarly killed all the naked drug lab workers and I thought that did a terrible job at showing how Viscous neglects human life because it shouldn't take such a nasty and forced scene.On Gren
I agree with the fans that Gren being an entirely different forced trans personality makes no sense at all and is cringe given that it completely doesn't fit properly but at the same time its no issue if the live action Gren still proves to be an interesting character who nicely influences the storyline of the show.On the humor
To me at least a good portion of the humor begins to seem to fit in correctly with the original anime but translated to a more comfortable form for viewers who simply don't need a 1-1 with the original.On all the bad reviews
Honestly everyone who watched the original has fell into a hate frenzy and I almost fell into the same after being satisfied that others felt the same problems that I felt, but after changing my perspective on things there is much to love about this live action and I am looking forward to more seasons of the show.Overall
You should watch the show, you should enjoy the entertaining aspects of the live-action and you should not be constantly picking it apart at every moment it might make you want to vomit as a fan of the anime. I understand that want to vomit but let's hope they tighten it up in the future because I really do wanna see a season 2 for it, it could prove to be an amazing show in the future with many interesting seasons and an interesting overarching storyline."
goosoid,Does the fighting ever end and character development begin?,4/10,29 November 2021,"I have never seen anime version, so maybe I just don't get it.I was really looking forward to this but then it was just 30 mins of non stop fight scenes, tenuously connected with plot. I quit.Maybe it got better. I will never know.

human-02077,"Solid, but nothing special.",6/10,19 December 2021,"Honestly, I was really on the fence about this series but seeing that Netflix has now cancelled Cowboy Bebop's reboot, it's fitting to give it a brief spoiler-free review.Music is very faithful to the original anime, Tank! Comes back for the opening as well which was very nostalgic to hear. Action scenes are really nice, but nothing special. Plots of episodes range from faithful to the anime to unique to the reboot with some (Such as the first episode) being butchered to introduce a main character early. Production value is very high and it shows, the CGI scenes look great and really add to the show. However there are shortcomings when it comes to these aforementioned changes to the plot and the casting/writing of certain characters.The cast is fairly good, I was very happy to see Spike and Jet as well acted as they were and in my opinion Jet being better acted by Mustafa Shakir (Nothing wrong with John Cho as Spike though, but Jet is easily my favorite for this reboot). Sadly, I have no idea what happened with Faye because to me it seems like they completely changed her character. I saw Cowboy Bebop's anime for the second time earlier this year and I do NOT remember Faye being an overly foul-mouthed person trying hard to be edgy and funny. This is not the actors fault, merely how she was written. Outfit and design changes are fine but I simply cannot say that they did Faye justice with how badly she was written.All-in-all, this is by no means a stellar series, but if you have no experience with the anime I recommend watching the reboot, it's a fun little piece of media if you distance it from the original IP."

douglaslwiggin,The actors deserved better.,10/10,20 June 2023,"This show was great, I grew up on cowboy Bebop first anime to break my heart as a kid. This adaptation was not horrible. Do I like what they did with some characters? No. But John Cho was excellent no matter what anyone says this had a good cast overall. John gave his all to this role and it shows. I was truly impressed. I am a hardcore anime fan and I love Sci-Fi as well, it makes me rather upset what happened here. I am truly disgusted with the whiney nay saying haters. I wish this had been given a real chance, I believe they had something here. So much potential lost on this one, at the very least John Cho could have probably carried this story on his own despite the cheesy overdone character designs of certain individuals.

kennyboufadene,Pretty damn good!,9/10,10 June 2023,"I was not happy at all after the first episode, didn't feel right, but after the second and ongoing episodes I started to love it. I just had to get over that it was different in some ways from the animated show. Not perfect, but very good if not compared 100% to the original. One episode to go, and only thing to complain about was too little Ein, and no Ed at all, which is pretty accurate story-wise. Extremely sad that there won't be a season 2. This show had a lot going for it. Jet is damn oerfecty played. Faye is close enough. Spike is not brooding enough, BUT, John is doing an awesome job doing his thing with the character, love them all."
mmd11,Stylish and worth a watch,8/10,22 November 2021,"Yes i dont like i all the changes from the anime but at the same time i respect that adapted the style of the anime quite well. The show is entertaining have really good action and effects, characters are interesting and the story is entertaining except for a bit of a non sensical ending to the season that seems to be meant to change a vulnerable character to a savage one with no justification. Also as netflix does with most show they have to shove LGBT characters in there for no good reason except for ""Representation"" problems is they picked one of the main characters which forces one of the possible anime tropes out of the door as to potential relationships.Anyhow still a good show.

trystanchubb,Tough crowd. But that's anime.,10/10,22 December 2021,"I loved it. I get it, I was a huge fan of the original series, had the soundtrack and box set. I appreciate that it's a classic too. But I think it's bold to take it on but overall I think they did a fantastic job, I really hope they do the next series and maybe take on some of the hard core fans disappointments and see if it can be made even better.The story line of the original series was great so of course get the acting and visuals right and your away. Can't wait to see the mushroom episode. 😄

swerder,Another instance of the original iteration being far superior.,3/10,6 December 2021,"Netflix's iteration is little more than a hollow imitation of the original. The changes to the characters and their motivations fall flat in far too many respects to make the show a worthwhile watch. I would only recommend this series to someone who has never seen the original series, and even then just so they would have something awful to compare the awesomeness of the original to. If you've already seen the original Cowboy Bebop, about this iteration at all costs."
huntressamanda,It's not a loofa on a stick,6/10,21 November 2021,"While I'll admit to being a hardcore fan of the anime (having seen it way back when it was new {date me much} and watched it many times over since) I was both excited and terrified of this. Live action can go so horribly wrong (from either country) that you want to collect all the copies and set them on fire so we can all pretend they don't exist.This adaption isn't half bad, in fact it could have been a good match for its anime had they not rewritten Vicious and Julia. Those characters resemble nothing of their 2D counterparts (aside from hair color) and it was very disappointing. Julia was fierce and smart, being a hitwoman, making them a trio instead she's reduced to some wimpy lounge singer who married Vicious (what's that about?) and Vicious is also this whiny emo rich boy with a maniac violent streak instead of the cold calculating ruthless killer in the anime. A villain you both feared and respected. It's rare to find that kind of depth in your antagonist and these writers ruined it.Aside from trainwrecking those two characters, our main trio was amazing. Cho really embodied Spike to the point that I was speechless. I thought he'd be too old to play energetic Spike, who despite his sloth-like habits was impatient and liked to jump right in when he had to but Cho brought that energy (never doubted his ability to bring Spike's quips and sarcasm). Faye's sass and humor were there, as well as her fighting prowess. Jet's sensibility and justice (and bonsai tree) were also present. So they did a great job there. The props were stunning as well, I just missed Ein not getting his fair share of screen time. All around, like I said, they did a great job up until Julia/Vicious.Looking forward to seeing more of Ed and Ein in the next the season (and hopefully they'll fix Vicious)."
adamcblock,Not quite the anime but still quite good,8/10,20 November 2021,"Despite what super purists of the anime or peoole with unopened minds, the 2021 TV show is quite good. Is it a 1 for 1 remake of the original? No. But i think it's almost better this way. It's more better suited as a companion piece or alternative viewing. The sound, set design, music, and pretty much all of the cast are on point. John Cho struggles a little here and there with Spike's tone, but overall he does a good job. Some of the changes are even for the better believe it or not. More on Spike, Vicious, and Julia's relationship I think was missing from the anime. The story is more coherent instead of a collage of different episodes. But the tone and essence of the original anime remains in tact.

iamkingcyn,Trigger warning questions,6/10,4 December 2021,"I watched the anime as a preteen & was stoked to see there was a new adaptation. I have NOT WATCHED at all because another friend (a much bigger fan) was warned of a rape scene. I came to imdb to check the ""parent guide"" & haven't found anything about it. I'm sorry for asking in a review section, but hope someone can add more info about it on the page. Even mild depictions of rape can make someone want to kill themself & a lot of people (mostly victims) avoid content depicting it. Hoping someone can lend a warning to the fans who need to know about that before watching. At the least: if I've been misinformed, & there is no rape, thumbs down. If there is sexual violence, thumbs up. That response can help give more fans a heads-up :) 💗
Giving a 6/10 only per my die-hard bebop fan friends opinions who say it's not bad on its own but untrue to the real anime. Per them, this version seems like a fan-fiction done ""OK""."
randytcorpuz,Cyberpunk noir,10/10,15 December 2021,"I love Cowboy bebop. I love everything about this series. It's cyberpunk noir. Future meets old tech. I can not wait for season 2.

tates77,"Why to compare with the anime, just enjoy it!",8/10,8 January 2022,"I will start by saying that I have seen the entire anime at least 4 times, the last time I saw it in the company of my mother a couple of years ago, watching a daily episode after lunch in a season that I visited her at her house and I loved that she was enjoy it as much as I did, and I will also say that it is not by chance that my dog is named Faye.When I knew that the live action based on the anime was going to air, I was quite excited, but it was (is) obvious that never, as much as the fans wished it from the bottom of our hearts, the live action was even going to match to the original, why make that comparison? Has no sense.Well, starting from the above, bah! I did enjoy it, the aesthetics of the series, in its intention to resemble the original, does it very well, the photography, the color, of course the music, the scenes literally copied, the exaggerated characters, the flat and sarcastic of the Spike's personality, Cho seems to me a very successful actor, I only find him a little older; Jet, it's as emotional as his personal plot should be; Faye is as sexy, friendly and violent as I expected without getting to the clichés. I insist, of course, that I am giving enormous licenses not to ask for more than what any casting could have given, and surely there will be a lot of ""purist"" who thinks exactly the opposite.Among the weak points, I would have liked Viciuos to look a bit more physically similar, and I think he was represented much more chaotic and expressive than the original, I would have even preferred another way to play it and even another actor, without meaning that Hassell did it badly. Another point that could have been better is the choreography of the fights, which I feel very slow and with predictable blows and only in the last episode I found the appropriate rhythm and the expressions of Spike's own (style that is supposedly based on the philosophy of Bruce Lee).In conclusion, it is very acceptable and as the episodes go by you enjoy it much more. And yes, if you haven't done yet, look at the anime, that's a ""must see""."
ronaldpakpahan,They thought they could make it better...,6/10,2 December 2021,"Production wise it's a fantastic effort and casting for the three leads was very well done. The biggest shortcoming was making Vicious such a prominent character and rewriting him in a way that made him look so weak. He only ever yells and complains and shows his temper making it all the more unrealistic for him to be the big bad or a syndicate boss no less.

svchost-51920,Rewriting the characters is just too much,4/10,5 December 2021,"I like John and the bushmaster, and watching anime characters come to life is really exciting, but a few episodes in, everything begins goes south, the wokeness, the character change, the rewriting, it just has to happen doesn't it? Such as shame, love the actors.

pdofak,Perspective and respect both missing,9/10,27 March 2022,"Great job remaking a pop culture iconic show.I/We are huge fans of the anime and the movie.It's crystal clear that the humans that worked on this remake did an incredible job.Perspective people!The original anime was on another level up - When it released in 1998.The opening sequence of the movie is pure movie making magic - For 2001.The cynical nitwits bashing this redo are lacking real perspective. Do they really think the live actions version needs to mimic the anime 20 plus years later? They'd be griping the the show was a lame hack job if it did.This show started tentatively and found it's feet by about the third ep. Hoo rah, that was speedy. We love what they did. The world building and new storyline deviations from the original are solid and interesting. The new versions of the old characters works just fine. By the end of the season I really wanted to see where they were going next. Very disappointed to not get the opportunity to see where it goes.IMHO they could have been more creative on the cursing. I personally don't care but apparently it tilted some people. This show could have found a median where the cursing wasn't cartoony but maybe a bit less harsh. Lots of room in futureistics to play.The character Spike alienated audience when he killed the young witness. I also thought he lost audience when he took his brother's girl. That might have been out of character too.I know and get exactly why the writers did both of those actions. It just seems to me they could have accomplished the same things more creatively. I was so hoping he would give us reason to redeem him and not getting the next season just makes it all the more painful.I'm pissed the show didn't get a second season. It was on the verge of blooming into a great experience that would stand tall alongside the anime.I wish to thank the crew, physical and digital, that created everything behind the cast. What a brilliantly crafted eyeful! Incredible!Many thanks to the cast. You all did wonderfully and don't ever think you didn't do it right. We are completely invested and care about your characters.Boo on the Network for not having balls enough to follow through another season to wrap up the threads. And here's why; You think what you hear about a show is what people think. WRONG. You are only hearing from the vocal ones. The vast majority of the audience expects the creator folks to do good works, expects to enjoy and find value in what they consumed, creators go on to create other good works, and on it goes. You will never hear from the audience. You only hear from the loudmouths. And they tend to armchair quarterback largely just to hear themselves.So yet again a network cancels a show before its time not caring that it just spaced the audience. We don't forget the lack of respect we've been shown. The network will reap the same.I've worked in the biz. I have a clue how hard it is to make good content. I'm grateful for, and tip my hat to, all the mega talented folks that created Cowboy Bebop, all versions.Peace."
nurtekin429,People need to understand movies of anime don't need to be 100% as in the anime.,10/10,1 September 2023,"People need to understand movies of anime don't need to be 100% as in the anime.Get over it.Not every manga is same as in anime.This negative attitude causes netflix to stop recording cowboy bebop.More people would and should have seen the movie. They think they have accieveied big thing by boycotting.In reality they have ruined.Now I need to write around 254 caracters to post this so I need to say more. I hope this was enouf. Its not I need 156 caracters more. Watch the series its good. The colors, acting, the decor's look great. For god sake 53 caracters more. This is I think my first review."
cynstress21,Haven't seen the Anime,10/10,17 December 2021,"I have not seen the Anime, and I was really enjoying watching this show but before I could even watch it all, it got canceled.I understand many who watched the Anime compared this show to it. That's not fair to this show.I think as a stand alone sci fi, it is quite good. Lots of great effects, fighting and blowing stuff up. An intriguing story of three different people trying to make it in the world they live in while all of their pasta show up to haunt them.Sad that it has been canceled.

mail-1328,Anime fanboys ruin everything,10/10,4 December 2021,"Of course the anime fanboys were going to hate it, that much was inevitable, but don't be put off by the opinions of basement-dwelling neckbeards who want to marry their Dakimakura pillowcases. This is a wonderfully realised adaptation with a terrific cast, a great soundtrack and a slick, stylish sensibility that quickly becomes addictive. It makes more of its restricted budget than many movies or series that cost ten time as much. Give it a chance and it will not disappoint. It's one of the sci-fi highlights of the year.

leohereon,Spike Spiegel was casted wrong..like...WHAT?,2/10,21 November 2021,"Spike Spiegel supposed to be charismatic, tall, sassy, funny. The Actor of Spike (John Cho) is....emotionless??! Dead inside??! His Eyes don't even move, he has not the right vibe and skills to portrait a Charakter like Spike Spiegel, for me he alone kills the mood of everything else cause...I don't believe him to be this charakter ...it was the wrong cast.The Setting looks nice, Faye is also allright, Jet Black changed from a white person to a black one - but at least he also portraits the essence of him allright.Visually it looks nice.But...you can't cast a bad main charakter and expect it to not ruin the mood.I don't see an ounce of Spike in John Cho. Nothing. At. All.

nhicks-85545,Stop being a fanboy hater,7/10,21 November 2021,"I created an account just so I can give an honest perspective.I am probably one of the biggest original anime/movie fanboys to ever walk the earth. That being said, I didn't go through it automatically finding reasons to hate it. Here is what I actually thought.I lot of love and work went into this. The influence and the tone are all there. It is a very enjoyable watch. They borrow some of the stories, but they make them their own. One huge problem.There is one character prevalent throughout the series that should not be there. It ruins the whole ideal of Spike's journey, and this character just flat out ruins the final episode with a twist that on top of making no sense just makes it painful to watch. One of the most prolific scenes in anime history bastardized to create some story arc that should never, ever exist.That being said, even if you are a fan, go in with an open mind, enjoy it for what it is, and hope there is a second season to wrong the travesty of an ending, because it can surely be rectified."
raptor-tm,A set up for the feeling of the Anime,8/10,23 November 2021,"I think they did exactly what they probably set out to do. Create the world and feel of Bebob over the course of a season for a Netflix wide audience. Season 2 could be incredible if they don't fear the hate they are receiving.

supahungy,A great show with its own personality but People are too critical,8/10,1 January 2022,"Don't listen to haters the show is unique, fun and left me wanting more. I understand fans of the anime series being disappointed to a certain extent. Personally i judge shows or books i love that are made into a series a little hard too but everyone needs to realize no matter what they wont be satisfied. I bet most of the haters binged watched the entire season and if so then in some way they liked the show. I thought it was a really good show and enjoyed the action, banter, as well as the storyline, especially since it was different from other shows. The show carved out its own personality that was different from other shows and now of days you rarely see that. Lets at least let them finish season 2 for a conclusion before trying to cancel the show cuz sometimes it takes time to develop things. Instead of over criticizing support the show and make suggestions on how to make it better. Sorry needed to vent cuz i wanted another season but just watch the show guarantee you will enjoy!

I've wanted more Cowboy Bebop for years and this show leaves it wide open for an expanse on the Cowboy Bebop universe. Sometimes it doesn't quite hit the note, but I'm eager for the encore."
sethwynn14,If I wasn't a fan of the anime I might've enjoyed it,5/10,9 December 2021,"Pros: The fight scenes, (most) of the visuals, and the coolness Spike and Jet exude. Adapting what the writers could into 10 episodes, I thought the story prior to the final episode was okay sans a few blemishes here and there (one scene mentioned below).Cons: Outside of Spike, Jet, Fad, and Ein, the casting and adaptation of the main characters is atrocious.Faye's actress might've stood a chance with a more correct costume and better writing. Instead, they made her far too expressive for the longer floating in the wind that the anime introduced her as. I won't even mention the ""Netflix woke"" scene that was included outside of the fact I was engaged in the show until that scene. From then on, it was a sluggish watching experience just to say I finished it.Julia and Vicious are an abomination of their anime counterparts. The major change to the anime's story to create a season 2 is ""Netflix bloat"" at it's core. I'm not sure I'll venture into season 2 with the new ""Julia,"" who seems nothing like the anime's Julia.I'm glad someone attempted to remake the series in live action, I just wish it hadn't been Netflix."

jjiawen,Hot Mess,7/10,20 November 2021,"When it's good, it's good. When it's bad... prepare to cringe.When it tries to emulate it's original material, oh boy. It tries way too hard. Even worse, sometimes it copies the original shot for shot. It's impossible to escape the painful comparison. Animation cannot simply translate to film.Honestly, watching naked people make out in blue tint and the oh-so-subtle rose motif scattered about made me itch. Julia and Vicious... I can't. I don't know to laugh or cry sometimes. Both. Maybe both.I can't see John Cho as our 'I love the kind of woman that can kick my ass' Spike but he plays a chill, traumatised, gun-toting martial artist decent enough. His interactions with Jet are fun.Faye feels like a teenager that swears and insults every two sentences because she's 'cool'.POSITIVES
Jet is a godsend. Mustafa Shakir is incredible here. The voice and mannerisms are absolutely faithful. Seeing him on screen is always a delight. He always elevates the other characters on screen, because honestly they need it.The worldbuilding is amazing though. Seeing ships, planets and ecosystems coming to life was breathtaking. The colour saturation, array of people and decadent architechture bring something the original cannot match. I'm impressed!As a fan of the original, I wanted a live action that wouldn't compete with the original. Because it would be a losing battle.Watching this series is a battle indeed. There are some incredible fight scenes, old enemies with cool twists and locations that are truly out of this world. (Also Jet!)
But it's suffocated by some very cringy characters (WTF... Tuna?), questionably icky flashbacks/ copy and paste scenes and... lack of godly Spike Spiegel charisma.John Cho is a great guy. Great actor . But he doesn't carry this weight. Sorry John."
vreelandzakary,Wish the anime was longer....,8/10,25 November 2021,Wish the original was way longer then what it is like how they took most of the main sorry and reimagined it I'll give it a 8 because I didn't like the thrown in lesbian bs..... for the character spike the did a ok pick he is Chinese jet black the voice matches pretty decent and the girl fey? Will she's there never watched the show for her character but can't hate the show if it goes past the original plot and makes it owns story....
garethedwardwilliams,"Stylish, fun, well-produced sci fi",9/10,24 July 2022,"I'd never heard of this series before I watched it, and I went in with no expectations. So I was pleasantly surprised by the combination of Western and Sci Fi, with a heavy dose of film noir and jazz.This is a highly stylised, slick show with what must be an impressively high budget. The ships and space scenes look great, the best I've seen outside of a cinema blockbuster.I'm not convinced that Luke Cage (Mustafa Shakir) can play anything other than Luke Cage, but John Cho is excellent, and all the supporting cast and bad guys are great too.It has been suggested that the low overall rating is due to fans of the original anime. It's hard to compete with nostalgia after all, and no-one wants to see their childhood heroes portrayed differently to how they imagined.Judged on its own merit though, this is a hugely enjoyable and well-made series, and I hope we see more of it."
ineedanothernewme,"For a live action anime adaptation, pretty good",8/10,21 November 2021,"This isn't going to be what the hardcore fans of the series were wanting, and that's because nothing will ever appease that crowd. There is no replicating the magic of the original series, and this series tried really hard at that. It was always going to fall short in the same way that all live action adaptations of anime do. With that out of the way, the team did a great job at trying at trying to match the visual style and overall they did a great job.

mrbdebarros,Great adaptation,5/10,21 October 2022,"Spike is the worst, the other characters are very well done, on the other hand the adaptation is very good since it considers the music in the moving image, things were invented but it is normal in an interpretation, what were they thinking to choose Cho for playing Spike?, I don't understand it since cowboy beebop is considered one of the most western anime series, if you didn't see the original series you might enjoy it more. The first episode is the best adaptation i ever seen from an animated series, its identical, the caracteres an the history is identical very well done, i recomen 200% the first episode.

samurninsai,"The ""new"" Cowboy Bebop",5/10,6 May 2023,"It's half as good as the original, with lack of the classic 80s humor and staples of the original. It lacks the favorite episodes, introductions and romance, lacks the episodic staples and finally lacks the character portrayals we know. It's a recreation that needed so much more to live up to the original, it got canceled because it didn't deliver.I am glad they canceled before they ruined the ""Knocking on Heavens Door"" recreation happen. When that comes out, I hope they correct their mistakes. Because ""Knocking on Heavens Door"" is the best of Cowboy Bebop, there needs to be a certain correctness and expectation to meat. Rewriting the movie will hit hard, but to take the 80s out of the series was a huge mistake.

cda-28499,10/10 on Casting,10/10,30 December 2021,"How refreshing to turn on a show and see not a single conspicuously Euro-American face as a lead - and the actors who are cast, they are wonderful to watch (I refer to the three bounty hunters at the center of the stories). And how utterly fantastic to see women in their forties and beyond cast in unexpected ways, frequently. Seeing these women in these roles makes you aware of just how sickeningly sexist and ageist (in the case of women) the industry is. Yet, the actors are so great and perfect in the roles! What is wrong with the industry? Let this be the future of the US industry, please.

afro_boy_89,Give it a pass,4/10,21 November 2021,"First time reviewer.I only watched 30ish mins of the first ep and it felt rushed with a side of bad writing. Characters to me were all over the show and I feel that the anime series had awesome script and that this show should have stuck with that. This show could of had potential and unfortunately that's all it be ever known as.

Casting felt right, the writing was good, and the chemistry between the characters felt like it did in the anime. Overall I had a great time watching it and hope they make another season!

I wanna watch season 2 if it's not cancelled, and see what can they improve from previous season.

SpikeS1986,Superficial & Artificial,5/10,6 December 2021,"I must say that Cowboy Bebop is my favaurite TV show from all time, I have watched it many times & everytime that I watch the Real Folk Blues part I & II I just can´t stop watching it.I knew that Netflix is not going to be at the level, but I was still expecting a good show, after watching it, I must say that the show is not a good show after all.In first place, what I see is all the show is too superficial, it doesnt feel real, its like a theater function, the clothes, the decoration, the cities, even the hairstyles are feeling artificial, so every act, every scene is like a satire from the anime, you watch it but you dont believe it, so, if you havent seen the anime, you cant emphatize with the main characters since you feel it too fake.The second point that I dont like it its the scriptlines, basically they took the 26 chapters from the anime & mix them with a cocktail, so basically at one chapter you can see many different moments from the original anime but mixed in different situations that doenst fix at all, you just think, WTF, what is doing this moment here, or they change some moments & characters because no reason.The last thing & the most important thing is how the serie focus on the main characters & their storylines, if you have watched the original serie, the 3 main characters, Spike, Jecht & Fate have got a past that they can´t scape from them, they are living in a dream (one of the slogan from the serie is that, if you are living a real life or living a dream) of the present to try to go ahead from their past, so every season with the past of one of the 3 characters at the original serie was very serious, grave & depressive moment, those special moments were those ones that make you emphatize with them, specially Spike, with Julia. One think that I hate from Spike from the Netflix serie is the heartberak expression that he has got in his face, at the original serie Spike was a person who never expressed any emotions on his face, even when he was passed a bad moment he was passive anytime, but in this serie you see a very expressive Spike, & that makes Spike with less personality, maybe the cultural shock between Asia & Western is really related here.The only good point that I see is the character of Julia, at the original one Julia was like an angel, like the only thing pure in the world of Spike, she was the only thing that Spike things that its good in his world, but in Netflix one Julia is a person, a person who try to survive in a world that is dangerous, so she is more manipulator, smart & evil, that is good because she is a person, not an angel, that is a very good change to give Julia more presence & personality in the storyline.I´m so sorry for this show, because its not at the level of the masterpiece of the original show."
jayfreeest,"Its not the anime, but no live action show can ever be an anime.",10/10,21 November 2021,"This will be spoiler free other then general changes they made but i will not go into the specifics of those changes.Compared to the anime this of course will fall short... of course anything will fall short to one of the greatest pieces of art work or anime of all time, But as a a live action show based off of the anime its pretty fantastic in its own right.1.- The story -The story itself is pretty damn close to the original with the exception on how the characters meet. In the anime the scenes they they were originally together already is a scene they might of decided to tag together. (again as spoiler free as possible). Also there have been changes to how it ends very slightly and the anime really flushes out spikes old flame Julia and his old enemy viscous stories in a way that ends them up in those scenes in the anime that they just happen to appear with nothing to explain why. Now obviously this is a preference for some people, maybe some preferred the mystery of it and maybe some prefer the backstory more detailed. Either way it does a good job of it in its own way and it has to if it wants to continue on for seasons to come. Anyone who understands why the small changes were made in the show know it for the future progress for the show (and to also catch in fans and audiences who may have never even seen the anime all together).2.- Music -Do I even need to get into this? Beautiful jazz as beautifully sounding as it was in the anime and even a little more fitting to live fight scenes.3. Characters -/Spike/ I'll start of by saying cho does a great job at that non nonchalant attitude spike has(plus they nailed his hair which I never thought would be a thing should it become an actual show). His martial arts moved seemed really fluid which was another important aspect./Faye/ This one seems to be on the bigger debate out of the characters. Now honestly if I did not already read some article of fan boys complaining about her not having her lewd look from the anime, I probably wouldn't of even thought about it as much but she definitely is more clothed then the anime but if you start comparing real life women to anime women... well you end up filters on Instagram so.. yea. Her acting was good but it seemed a little to much for faye, they kinda sent her in a little more of a ""holy nutballs"" or whatever it is she blurts out, type of direction. As far as the actor herself i believe she was a pretty good fit for faye and other then nitpicking there aren't to many complaint to be made./Jet/ Honestly its refreshing they used a black actor because Jet always had a more deeper sounding voice (I believe the original voice actor was black to if I am not mistaken) and he really sounded close to jet. If i had to nitpick then the two issues I have is 1. His mutton chops look almost glued on and 2. Jet was more muscular but that is just my own nitpicking and it barely changes my overall opinion. (surely you'll have your own as well) but its like that going back to faye and nit picking she doesn't have double Ds and less clothing.. it doesn't change the overall quality of the characters by much./viscous/Julia/ Seeing the back story behind spike more fleshed out may of been nice to some people and hated by others. The mystery kinda had a nice kick to it in the anime but for a live action show it especially to people that may have never seen the anime it would of felt weird and without giving any spoilers, These changes were needed to progress the show into more seasons to come(hopefully). As far as the characters go this is on of my bigger disappointments only because i pictured viscous has this completely silent psycho and the as well as the actor the character just did not really appear the way I expected him to be. All in all these changes may have been necessary to continue a series that will eventually need new written material to continue, so we shall see where it goes./ein/ spot on, Great dog, good eyesight/ed/ 0d73hd)2/dbh%us8 ReViEw hAcKeD bY eD 8-)4. OverallThis show is a great watch but you need to let go of that exactly like the anime expectations, some things just cannot be expressed in real life like it can in an anime... its that simple. The show did a great job and its something many people have been waiting for years (keanu reeves). I am excited to see where it goes from here on and if you you dont do yourself the justice to watch this then, your gonna carry that weight..Thanks for reading hope this helped."
chocoboo-04664,Ruined childhood memory,2/10,20 November 2021,"Netfix ruined my childhood memory. Only good thing about this series was John Cho's acting and the corgi. I have high doubts about the casting manager's qualification because everyone else sucked at acting. Come on, it's proven over and over from Japan's film market. Movie shouldn't be shot like anime just because the original was an anime.

karbenzhertz,A good show but not for those fanboys,8/10,27 November 2021,"Overall it's a well produced show and the casting is okay. For every anime adapted show there are always two groups of people hating it and giving it 1 or 2 stars: The never-stop-complaining and comparing anime fanboys and their brainless followers. The music part is nearly perfect they even almost got the original team yet someone is still complaining it wtf. You know what. Those fanboys just want to watch their favorite anime or whatever die slowly so that decades later nobody will remember it anymore. That's why some adaptions from things without a even plot like league of legend thrives and vice versa. Come on just give your favorite title a second chance.

skorts,An adaptation more similar in spirit with Edge of Tomorrow than Death Note,8/10,21 November 2021,"The show isn't a perfect adaptation, it has a lot of ways it can still improve, especially the action sequences. Still, it's a pretty fun show with moments that are kinda great.I was a fan of the original series and I decided to check this out expecting the show would disappoint and piss me off... but I ended up having a good time. To me, it's very similar to an Edge of Tomorrow, where changes were made to the original story to make it more light hearted and easy to follow. This adaptation doesn't have the ""weight"" the original has, but it's still a pretty entertaining watch.I'd encourage anyone who's in the fence to watch it! If you're able to keep an open mind, you may find it more enjoyable than these negative reviews might suggest.

ackernewton,It was chill until the end,7/10,21 November 2021,"I am a huge Bebop fan from back in the day, and frankly? This is 9 1/2 episodes of pretty chill. I honestly enjoyed watching most of this series. It had a fun cast that didn't totally mesh with the original, but it wasn't really bad in the ways it showed off the vibe of my favorite space cowboys. It had some pretty good moments here and there and I would have totally recommended this series to friends until.... well, the last 15 minutes it so.The last 15 minutes made me really hate this entire season. It could have been a chill and
fun remake of a masterpiece. But they had to make it in a way that begged for a second season. Honestly? After the iconic church shot it takes all of those fond memories and says ""nope, the characters you love really don't like each other and hey, second season will bring everything back in a whacky fun way!"" And now I can't recommend this show to anyone. I would really like to tell purple about it because it has some fun twists and turns. The show diverges from the anime a lot of the time, but it isn't bad for doing that. The cast was good, even great in quite a few moments, and the premise and storytelling work really well in a few episodes. But the ending makes me so angry.Do the characters justice. Don't make everyone hate each other in such a blase way. Y'all literally just went ""and everyone is sad and pissed off... also, here's radical Edward! Come back for season two!"" And I don't know if I will. Wasn't a bad show. Just wasn't a great one, and nowhere near as fulfilling as the original. Watch that instead since it's on Netflix as well. This will leave you craving for so much that it just can't give you."
gunstar-62974,"""Space Cowboy""",5/10,20 November 2021,"The fact is a legit live action adaptation of the spirit of Bebop was already made in 2002 it was called ""Firefly."" This was a mishmashed spoof and not a successful one at that.

BillCSullivan,Long time fan,7/10,22 November 2021,"I am 33 years old I remember watching the anime on toonami and maybe 30 or more times after that. At first I was completely against this happening but once you realize that the new show is directed like it is still an anime and not actors/real people it really grows on you. Idk if that will make sense to you but it does to me. The episodes are fast paced just like the show always catching the characters in the middle of something already and we get to catch up on what they are getting them selves into and then out of. It's not the anime and cho may be a bit old but over all it's definitely worth watching.

And it did work very well.Unfortunately here's the result of the script, casting, and many many ""artistic liberties"" taken by the live action version.It's... pretty bad. It's really pretty bad.I went into this expecting changes, and knowing that it would just be impossible by the nature of the change in media, from animated to live action, to accomplish the same moods, and cinematography. But I remained optimistic, all the way up until the last episode. Which was outright horrible plot wise and character wise.They tried to make it their own thing while still borrowing little things here and there from the show. Which was charming at first, and good fan service. But towards the end became less and less welcome, as the show had changed so much that the little nods to the original didn't deserve to be there.Speaking of didn't deserve to be there, Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts, Geniuses behind the music of the original return to once again to amazing things music wise. But not only is it not enough to redeem the shortcomings of the show, but as a fan of the original, the association with the music is undeserved.The casting is mostly bad. Mustafa Shakir as Jet Black was probably the best in the show. Good acting, and good capturing Jet's personality, and of course, his voice. The worst of it being Alex Hassel cast as Vicious. Fundamentally changed his character from a cold hearted, calculating, independent, and competent villain, to an insecure, loose canon with daddy issues. John Cho as Spike Spiegel wasn't a complete miss, but it wasn't good either. Steve Blum will always be the voice of spike, and John Cho just doesn't have the same quality in his vocal delivery that made the original character what he was. The body language and attitude were a bit of a miss too, but a genuine performance never the less. Julia. Where to start. Between the complete 180 on her character to the depth of her character, which is meant to be left mysterious and shady. I understand that they probably wanted to do something fresh and new, and hit the fans of the old show with a twist or two. But when one character's relationships fundamentally affect the dynamic of other characters and you change that without changing the others.. You take a big gamble. One that almost never paid off in this iteration. I liked Daniella Pineda's Faye Valentine, I think she was right up there with Mustafa Shakir. Once again taking liberties with the character, but with her it wasn't a complete disaster.The cinematography at times feels like they used an I phone at a comicon to record cosplayers acting out their favorite fan fictions. Yeah, that bad. From the lighting, to scene transitions, angles, focuses used... The original used lighting, and colors to set a mood. Characters held position in silence to create suspense. The lighting and colors would incept a feeling and set a tone.So that comment about cosplayers and fanfiction.. That's the feeling that you repetitively get watching this attempt. And one of the biggest downfalls of the show. The plot. The plot is both less thought out at times, and too thought out at other times. What do I mean about too thought out?...Characters and their backstories. This is, in my opinion, the biggest sin of the show. They've taken the ""Cowboy Bebop"" brand, it's characters and situations, and then taken many, many, many... Liberties with their backstories and retcons of their stories. And honestly, I'm not sure which is worse, making up backstories that were meant to be left ambiguous, or fundamentally changing characters and their motivations to great detriment. The original left a large amount of backstory mysterious on purpose and it worked. Neatly wrapping up all of the character arcs in a ""bang"" (where my OG fans at)Which leads me to my last complaint worth mentioning in a review. They tried to leave it open for additional seasons. This may actually be the biggest sin of all. The original was as great as it was because they told as story, a great story, and then it ended. Poetically and tragically. But the way it was meant to. They weren't trying to keep milking a popular show. They set out to tell a story, and when it ended, it ended. For that reason, it had one of the best endings of any show in my opinion. Here, they leave it open. And the damage caused by that decision is in the plot suffering, and the characters arcs being left open. Character arcs that were pretty bad to begin with.So overall. It's a bad fan fiction, often trying to come from a good place, with some good acting, mostly bad, mostly due to casting. Just re-watch the original."
cqggnfmj,Excellent Sci-Fi Show,9/10,31 December 2021,"I feel like the people who panned this show were big fans of the anime. Whenever there is a remake or adaptation of a book people get upset because it isn't like the original. And I get that. But as someone who did NOT watch the anime, I REALLY enjoyed this show. I thought it was visually beautiful, clever and engaging. So give it a chance.

chordsbyriku,"Good series! The original is better, but this version is worth watching",8/10,22 November 2021,"I love the original anime of this show. I have it on DVD and Bluray. I also have the music on CD and Vinyl.I have lost count of how many times I have seen it.It is one of my favourite shows.Have they changed alot in this version? Yes, they have but I still like it.It is like comparing a book to a movie. The book is often better but that does not mean you can't enjoy the other version for what it is.This is a fun, space adventure show with creative world building and AMAZING music.The original is amazing but this is also a fun version that I enjoy watching."
mongmangmong,I enjoyed the show but just can't understand cast.,6/10,5 December 2021,"I love the original Anime and I know you can't expect the same quality but cast is a huge disappointment. I actually prefer story line of this to anime(I know some of you don't agree) but I couldn't accept Spike and Vicious cast. I think John Cho is a great actor. He payed well but he just isn't Spike ...I think one of Korean actor, Kang dongwon should have taken this role because of gloomy yet humorous atmosphere that Spike should have. Also I just think John Cho is too old.. I am sorry..And what about Vicious!! In the series he looks like a cosplay! Just dye the hair and make it long that is it!.. some one who is younger, darker, mysterious should have taken the role...I know they did the best they could but I was so disappointed because I really think there is so much potential with the show.The other thing is,, fighting action scenes were terrible... it doesn't look real nor exciting, it was rather slow, boring, old scene. I think."
jose_kirchner,Great potential,7/10,25 November 2021,"Despite the changes made to the characters and the story, this version keeps the tone and the soul of the original. Of course it has a lot of space for improvement, I can't wait for the second season, I hope they learn from their mistakes.

bkpdiana,I'm a fan since 2000s of anime and love the series,10/10,31 December 2021,"My review is simply 10/10. The actors, the vibe, the scenarios, and of course the soundtrack (I love you Seatbelts) are PERFECT. The series must continues because it is a great work and we can't miss the opportunity of having a great work on Netflix. There are many bad series that don't deserve to continue and they're still getting it. Those who say are pure fans are only fkn mindless fanatics who are only blind fools and hypocrites that want their piece of likes and hates on internet. Only that. I bet many of them didn't even watch the anime like I did 20 years ago. Stop to be assholes. I want the series to continue and successfully completed. Even animes and mangas aren't the same. Adaptations have differences and this, on my opinion, when well done, only makes the story better, and that is the case. Love it. Please keep up with the fantastic job.

davidkeithforfar,"Great show, but should of been named differently.",7/10,16 February 2022,"The show itself is good. Great at times, but feels to different to the original anime to really have the use the same title. The cast are all good actors, and pull their roles off well in this show, but a faithful version of the anime it is seriously not.If they had just named it differently, it would of reviewed far better in my opinion.Ed is only in it for a what seems like 30 seconds. That was my biggest gripe about the show.

horsemanuk,Fun and slick,7/10,22 February 2022,"First off I have to say I have not yet watched the anime. I have read into the plot of the source material. I can therefore totally understand the criticism. It's therefore perplexing why Hollywood seem to have this tenancy nowadays to deviate so wildly from the source and ultimately irk the core fan base. It naturally invites immediate criticism and hamstrung the series from the get-go.That said, I still enjoyed the series, at best you can say it was inspired and loosely based on the anime. Anyone expecting to watch a direct live action port will be disappointed.If you enjoy a fun and slick sci-fi romp with some amusing moments, it's certainly worth your time. I personally feel it deserves another season or two as well. In my opinion, it's no worse and actually much better than a lot of content that gets the green light for series after series.I would perhaps even to go as far to say I'd rate this a 9/10 had it been truer to its source material. I had to take off points for deviation though. Artistic licence must be applied in moderation, like a single flake in an ice cream cone. Not applied liberally and without caution like a kid with the chocolate sauce bottle, high on sugar."
Good_Is_Good,I think its awesome!,9/10,14 March 2022,"I'm not big on remakes. GITS was good as it could be, but didn't have the same feel. This live action brings the characters to life. Jett is cast perfectly and all the others we know protray their roles well. Though Cho isn't what we think as Spike when we see him, he definitly brings the attitude. I wish Faye wore those skimpy outfits, but again, she is potrayed well. The storyline has actually been improved with things flowing better, but not taking away from the original storyline. Purists won't like it. This is a hidden gem and sad it only got one season.

ycarogabriel,"Not great, but not totally bad",5/10,27 November 2021,"This adaptation takes all the archetypes wrong, making mess with the conceited genre mixing and complexity of the original series, turning in a almost entirely different show spirituality. It's another thing, not bad, but for of the original concept. The end of the series are the worst in terms of messing up archetypes, showing some characters background, messing with the most important genre of the original concept, the western. So if you're looking for a generic thing, go for it. And don't go what the original series fist, cause definitely will exacerbate how much it could be better.

cb-89-397180,Great on it's own,9/10,18 February 2022,"This serie doesn't have to be a perfect copy of the old Cowboy Bebob to be good.They are both great in their own way.I enjoyed the serie immensely and I'm sorry it stopped after one season.I don't get Netflix for that an I hop the will reconsider their decision.The music score is fantastic.

mightycranium-281-811040,This was great !,9/10,1 October 2022,"I seriously can't believe they canceled this already.. Definitely ""binge worrhy"" Great characters , great story line .. unlimited potential for character development . Everyone has great chemistry and all tossed because a bunch of whiney fan boys didn't like it cause its not anime enough for them... too bad . It would of been great to watch this show develope but someone without any sense cancelled it before it had a chance .I dont know who made the call to cancel it but to quote spike speigal.. ""makes you wanna put a bullet in em""Maybe with some luck and some support from the people who do enjoy this they can bring it back into production...wishful thinking .

carbonstain,Idk what everyone's problem is! Fun show,10/10,6 April 2022,"I was a fan of the original animated series back when it came out. It was the only anime I found interesting and this recreated it well. The characters are true to the original and I think Netflix made a huge mistake by cancelling this before it even came out. Come on! Netflix continues garbage shows and cans this one right away? Anyways, very well done and kept my interest all the way through. Hopefully someone else picks it up.
